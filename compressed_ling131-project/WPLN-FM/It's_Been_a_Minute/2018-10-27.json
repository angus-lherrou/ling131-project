[laughter]\nAll right let's talk now about another thing that I Love besides Halloween candy or movies yes was difficulty romantic comedies yeah I Want to run you through a few of the films that I watched over this summer a there was one movie in which to overworked assistance set their bosses up on each other\nWe need to miserable people\nWas another movie I watched this summer where a teenage girls private love letters from mysteriously males to Oliver crushes\nWeb streaming is made possible by the bone and joined Institute of Tennessee hoping patients make a living with pain from a drink traumatic accident or sports related injury a thing of the past appointments are available that bone and joined the tea and daughter word\nThat credibly drunk that night and I let them blacked out because [noise]\nThat's what's going on hunting for the fun thing about all these movies of these were all rom coms on Netflix you heard clips there from set it up to all the boys I've loved\nBefore and like father have you ever watch any of those movies two out of three okay which to I watched um televised I Love before of course so good and set it up yes letter I so love lovely I feel retro that but I feel I feel like it stokes a particular part of my heart same same\nSo these movies along with a bunch of other rom com releases on Netflix all summer we're part of this big push by Netflix to get some scribe has to watch them and uh comedies on the streaming service they even had a name for this big push they called it their summer of love nice uh and last week they put the data out some of the data out and it turns out that\nTens of millions of people watch these movies across the world is summer some eighty million people yes so I wanted to know more about this and Netflix in the summer of love so I called up someone who's been covering the summer of love very closely\nHer name was ... when I met she writes for the onions Avi club she'd been closely following the summer of love so we talk all about it\nHey going how are you good how are you doing I'm good thank you for your time oh my gosh thanks so much for having me super excited yet I have been kinda ... out\nFor several days now upon discovering that without my knowledge Netflix quietly made me fall in love with rom coms this summer and now you didn't even now [noise] um they called it the summer of love what exactly is it\nOh yeah the summer of love was like a menu of rom com movie is that Netflix kind of unfurled at the beginning of the summer\nA dad as it turns out it's not flicks reported recently for the third quarter report eighty million viewers watch and it's not even number of views that viewers so if you're like me and you watch them like four\nOr five times a piece you you can even multiply that number\nEight million people watching these rom coms my big question and first question about all of this was like what\nLed Netflix no or think that rom coms would work for them you know we've seen a movie studios and like the box office not really take to rom coms for many years now it's hard to find them in theaters so knowing that trend line what made Netflix say well this might work for us\nI think they just spied on completely underserved market\nYou know if you look at the summer box office the top ten movies are all sequels and genre\nAnd and comic book critic shoots yeah you know it's all like Mission Impossible an infinity war so if you want to see things blowing up at the multiplex you know you're living in the golden era but if you want like just to have a nice love story at the movies except for crazy Rich Asians summer you're kind of out of luck\nSo for Netflix it's kind of a combination of factors that they did they not only are churning out these rom coms they're also\nTagging a women creative forces women writers women directors some of them you know this is the first movie they directed or they directed like TV episodes before they're adapting Wayne novels they're finding creative forces that really has been under used and it's worked out really well for them\nYeah why have the big movie studios at the movies in theaters why are they left rom coms\nThey're not the safe bet that they once were like if you're going to you're going to put like ... million dollars and infinity war but you're going to get more Brazilian dollars back\nJamming with rom coms there was a a golden era you know when Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts you could just basically put Graham with anybody like that's what it was on double up next why not but then\nYou have something like Reese Witherspoon and Vince vaughan and for Christmases and the tank and these are super stars you're paying them a lot of money and then you're not getting your money back\nAnd it's also for the movie goer you know if I'm going to get a sitter and talk my husband into going to see a movie that's you know romance themes like it's going to have to be\nA kind of special event where for Netflix you know it's free I'm at home there's really no risk for me to like watch set it up and if I don't like it I'm just going to go watch Gilmore Girls reruns again like it's not a big deal\nBut then you end up liking set it up and like if you're like me I've watched it three times and then Netflix is going to send me more possibilities for that rom coms genre and I think that's how it all exploded\nYeah you know I think the thing with a rom com it's perfect for me a single person to watch at home alone because the last thing I Want to do you spend twenty dollars and see a lovely ... end up together river on screen and then I got to go home alone but\nOh yeah if you can do that with a Ben and Jerry's and a frozen pizza I mean that's not a Thursday night you got that going out to\nYeah should we expect movie studios big movie studios are putting movies in theaters to react to this Netflix news and say oh we should start making rom coms again like those Netflix's summer of love and its success lead to more rom coms in actual movie theaters\nUm that's an interesting question I I Do wonder about that because I mean crazy Rich Asians did so well because we just want you know a lovely\nMovie like that to senior year and in the story that I wrote another thing that was really prevalent we had a ton of commenters\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty proud supporter of independence thought whether\nThat's on line over the air or in a bottle Moritz Sierra Nevada dot com [noise] from the corporation for public broadcasting in the state of Joan crock who's ... serves as an enduring investments in the future of public radio [noise]\nAnd from the Jonas and James all night foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to it's been a minute for NPR I'm Sam Sanders and wanting to our listeners this portion of the show contains descriptions of sexual abuse of minors probably not good for kids\nWe've discussed the me too movement a lot on the show\nMe too and politics me too and how we would be two in journalism and NPR's newsroom even now we're going to talk about me too and sports and the dozens of stories we've been hearing for months about young elite athletes being abused by their coaches the doctors the mentors people they should be able to trust\nThe reality is causing a great deal of physical mental and emotional pain never healed he he took advantage of our men and our dreams\nThan some of the gold medalist in Delhi Raisman she was speaking of the trial of Larry Nassar\nHe was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women under his care\nAs a former sports doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State university ... Nassar was originally sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison in the wake of Nassar's trial top Olympic officials have been forced out most recently Mary Bono resigned as the interim head of USA Gymnastics [laughter]\nAfter a lot of criticism she held that job for less than a week [noise] today you'll hear from an elite athlete who came forward with her own experience of sexual abuse in another ... former speed skater Brady barrel ... she was sexually abused by another skater when she was just a teenager and\nSo he helps drive my teammate and I to and from practice which both of our families really appreciate it and so and he would only pick me up every day and we'd frequently go to\nThe rink and skate but you know sometimes we in other places but even if we did go to the rink and ... then there was more or less station that happened before and after I mean in the rain parking lots for high school parking lot\nBrighter he was Fifteen Years old and training to be an Olympic speed skater in New York state when thirty three year olds Olympic medalist ab Gable entered her life he was a skating God he quickly became Brad his mentor and helped her family out\nAs I said he used to drive my friend and I\nHome from practice in the summer and he'd always drop her off first\nThen I mean I can picture clear as day back out of our driveway go down the street stop sign to take a right and you go to my house\nAnd it was like that every time and then one time at that same stops on he took a left and he went to the um the streets over and I was a dead end which in hindsight it's interesting that he knew that there was a dead end there was a dead end he pulled the car over took off his teeth out and they turn to me and he said can I guess you\nWould have had in that moment I said nothing I just sat there\nWe'll sit here and honestly say I did not say no art and out in the door and not run away\nBut I was frozen yeah\nI mean people say they fight or flight but there's free and that's what happened and I remember after that when we put our seatbelts on and turn the car around I remember just being like\nFog or a I mean now now we have an expression I was like W ts [laughter] yeah you know and like shock from hundred percent and only ... how would I tell anyone who would believe me what proof have\nWhy would anyone believes that he would do you know I mean just um and it wasn't violet\n[laughter] in what we think of as traditional violence you know so he wasn't a stranger it wasn't a windowless fan you know all that that we pretend to make these people will be so [noise]\nYeah that I mean honestly God that is the day of my life changed\nYou will join us in the ... the the contact become more intense\nBut yeah so so a lot of people say you know like what is what do I mean when I say molested so to\nAnswer that awkward question on any I never had sex from the traditional um definition of sex but basically the legal terms is digital penetration um and he would put my hand on himself when he was wrecked um [noise]\nAnd you touch and follow me and I was Fifteen and he was thirty three\nWhile Andy just taken advantage of you do see also like getting close to your family at the same time I'm very much so\nSo ah he [noise] he had um a growing issue skating and so he saw my father for his doctor for that and my mom he came over to the house a couple of times and uh took piano lessons from my mom\nOh my goodness yeah so how you and your house for now wasn't from your mother you knew what he was doing to you she did not\nKnow how did that feel\nI don't even know I mean I think it it was such a time of\nConfusion and I was so dedicated to wanting to skate that I didn't have any other currency you know I didn't have\nAny anything to barter I didn't have\nMoney I didn't have 'em anything the only thing that he wanted for me was my prediction lesson slot body I'm and\nI'm about it was it so confusing because\nLike I said he wasn't violent with me and he took care of my skates which is very very very time consuming Amir blades are not flat so there's a slight rock to them nothing like hockey skates but there's something\nThere not straight they're bent to go left and the offset and so as especially as a kid like myself gets better and better and better I mean the improvement curve is is pretty deep as a kid\nAnd so I'm as you're getting better the all of those metrics have to change and for the night did any at all but trials sort of a winner club had a lot of athletes competing I mean we\nKnow training programs center the limbic trials so our coach you also was volunteer had a fulltime job and a family\nUm he and he took care of my plates and I mean our coach Andy and other top skaters are higher priority so he helped me out and a lot of ways but my mother said if you want to go to a skating find a ride to the rank and Andy was my ride [noise]\nDo do you think she ever thought that he was your boyfriend did you think at Fifteen that he was like something approaching a boyfriend\nI definitely did because I didn't know what else it could be yeah yeah because he was crying to me in and gave me things um you know bought me things about me gifts for math dinner I mean the things that seems silly and trivial\nTo someone like just stop for a second I I didn't have a driver's license yeah I couldn't go anywhere I'm I\nWas mowing lawns and the summer\nThat's how I had enough money to offset my skating my parents put up a lot of money and I had to contribute it's not inappropriate for kids to kiss and fool around and experiment when they're Fifteen with other Fifteen year old kids yeah right right\nSo that's what was so confusing about at all also took was part of the reason it took me so long to come forward and talk about it because\nFor so long it it was and it still is it's gray two things one so again I was in the tenth grade and that was when we had homecoming dance and I wanted to go with actually my date lived down the street from Andy one block away and\nHe said that I could quote go he let me go I'm so long as as soon as I came home I called him I couldn't go down after party I couldn't go to anything I had to come\nDirectly home and so I told the group of friends I was going with than my day and ever and I said I'm you know I have practice in the morning so I'm just after the dancing and I go home and I was like oh that's cool yeah we figured out fine\nBut it was because he was controlling yeah\nWhen I told my parents mom we pick me up you know the station ... station wagon\nA rolled into the school parking lot to pick me up and brought me home and no one thought anything of it and I have one of those memories in my brain of being in my bedroom
