E. F. very kindly stuck me into a a semi orphanage um which we had been an orphanage and now I went to school rather bizarre ... he was a lot in the boys you know one of my father\nSaid oh like literally this was a school that had been in an orphanage yes weeks before you got there like the big the big change over there are like well we're going to send a bunch of kids who lost a parent right in the war rights to the school right courtesy of you are at the royal air wars show\nSo they pay for my education which is very nice of them um but it was kind of thing you know she she didn't go by the way to have a ... I haven't done now do you have to stand up now I'm you know what I mean it certainly afterwards in hindsight you realize well that's kind of peculiar\nSelf selected group of people how how hard it must not have made us we have we and we didn't have any idea of what a father walls or even discipline so we were kind of a bit unruly and kinda sneaky and anti authoritarian\nAnd I think that was very useful for python what kind of relationship did you have with your mom when you were a kid and teenager well they intermittent because the terms were fourteen weeks so you were gone you know the school\nWas the oval role life and then there were moments of kind of oh we can go home now um for for the holidays\nYou got three weeks here two weeks that eight weeks in the summer and that was kind of wonderful in luxurious but then you're back to this thing you know ah\n... you know I [laughter]\nIt's a little discipline and very good things came of it for example I'd read everything by the time I didn't plan for university I was way ahead of people who are having a decent life from going out with teenage girls and enjoy the early sixties I we've had nothing we were just doing homework\nI haven't had that in a long time [laughter] it's only a few years old [laughter] [laughter] well I I I ... the thing is I've had the original version of that song I had for so long\nLike crazy like first blood orange album ... two thousand nine trying than [laughter]\nSo what's it like when you are making one of those records and how is it different from when you're making your own records are usually going in with demos or\nI'm not ... it varies it's all it's a kind of in my thing was clever people is out there in any way they want because I'm\nGiving myself as a service to them and so if they want me to just sit and come up with many of these wild as a producer I'll do that if they want me to produce truck I'll do that you know\nIt's whatever they want to ride in the room together just me and them create something\nThen I'll do that I'm very like if I've given myself\nTo that person and in that environment than I'm you know kind of ... will try and be respectful and make the best thing you know so it's a completely different mindset\nTo me just like walking around fit and I did a book it's like a different goal yeah different goalpost or\nYou have ... on this new record mhm I have a friend who thinks that did he may have magic powers\n[laughter] probably\nUh my friend comedian Chris ... how did he on his show a few times are both is is live show in his television show and at one point I did each assistant told him that he he or she believes that did he had magic powers and then did he did something magical\nI'm a really blue Christmas my [laughter] well [laughter] but like I think of all the people in the ... of all the people in the contemporary music industry or maybe the one who seems the least like a real human being to me is city\nOr like he seems like some like a mythical like a story about a record producer right so how did you get daddy on your record like to do like\nMeet him at the grocery store or like get is number arm somebody did you imagine that he would would you do have light duty part and you're like I got to get ready for that", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
