the central inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept surfing around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and you know all the great movies and the seventies and how they were shot and

middle age it's all coming up on both sides but [noise]\nOoh ooh ooh\nIt's I I'm Jesse Thorn in a resume that has spent decades Sarah Jessica Parker has performed some of the most compelling characters in TV and film\nShe kicked off her career adjust Fifteen starring on the CBS teenage comedy square pegs from there she appeared in movies like footloose LA Story and hocus pocus and there's also some show called sex in the city no big deal\nWhen I talked with her a couple of years ago she just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorce its second season wrapped up earlier this year\nThey're working on a third one now it's a dramatic that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and reverse that you find in its wake Sarah plays Francis a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker\nDon't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there was something compelling\nAbout the way they interact on screen the series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very Frank and sometimes very funny way\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce and missing from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband the news\nIs that last Christmas fishing in Alaska\nNow hang on a second that's the only time of the year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind\nI didn't mind it was the best Christmas I have had in years You're welcome sometimes I come home from work I'm\nActually feel happy\nWhen I see your high their part and I realize you're home\n\nThis is about my own job is and what this is I Want to save my life while I still care about it\nAlthough I Love you anymore\nOn a divorce [noise] Sarah Jessica Parker\nWelcome to bull's eye thank you thank you so much for having me\nI Want to ask you something um with a serious to begin with which is I had this experience or a couple of years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife\nA split up they were married and um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought oh that was for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people lived three thousand miles from me [laughter] that guy I care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right and uh it ... it occurred to me like how\nIntense I just I guess I just never acts I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience ... and the wall just crumbled all in one go [laughter] mhm um and I wonder what it's like for you to\nLive with and the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show\nLive with divorce you know every day when you go to the office\n[noise] um the experiences I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know I in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather I guess in some ways what you've described as witnessing your friends\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because\nI I guess you know the reason that I was interested in it initially in developing the show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party I have an affair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorce and all those things that surround\nSurround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the town that I was hoping for\nBecause it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um make alliances um and I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorce when it's not their own are really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the the ... ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel freaked out and I don't mean like in the sense like or does it make you feel like a a you and your husband are going to get divorced\nUm what like it's like an existential dread for\nMe [laughter] [noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad\nUm and I'm I'm\nI I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by it because it's both\nAn artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children in a ... active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like\nPushing on the bruise I I've always been that way and\nUm I I'm\nMuch more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the Bruce scene from divorce\nSo ah your character's name is Francis is a head hunter and this is the use of the cold open to the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new good um and they have this conversation\nFor

could say about Woody Allen's movies from the time I was young child the always went to see Woody Allen movies [noise]\nUm and when I was in Utah shooting footloose that summer I think now the white maybe two movies out and I didn't have a car\nBut on my days off I Would go to the movies one or two of which were Matthew Broderick movies so yeah I was very familiar with him I as a as a performer as an actor\nI look I'm a I I think that um any relationship is ... ... including a relationship between two very famous people as the two of you are\nBut is about like just regular people you know like I've done this job long enough to know that like everybody is a person you know you find a point on it but yeah people are you know human beings are but at the same time I do like the idea\nThat there was some part of you like the first time you and your husband made out or whatever where you are like making out with Matthew Broderick\nI'm never shared that the things you are you there was so ... um yeah I mean I I ... I thought he was I mean there was a reason I kept paying to see him um yeah so when we started dating um we met\nThrough um friends in the theater he was on the brothers and Matthew and\nNot the best friend founded the theater company called naked angels and I'd be hanging around there and um that's how we met and ah for sure part of that was I'd seen that in on a big screen and liked what I saw\nUm\nOr or how do you feel about Thomas food and churches distinctive mustache show divorce\n[noise] um I like it very much I'm I'm I'm so glad that he did that because it really has become a the six\nCharacter on the show [laughter] um [laughter] and um it's been a wonderful time for ...

I'm definitely a workaholic its problems\nIt's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in Korea stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go at tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit for stability and I've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but still is after\nUh you know like if if I can just get one of those big jobs everybody have to notice it and\nI have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation that had to kind of ... cop to the fact is\nThat there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants witnessed that asks cat in New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and that's been out talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressed and it's so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get\nWhat's my next gig ... far might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy you're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as like could I\nYou know could I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square the some of the standard you could say some of the stuff I've done\nI don't know like I mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock threw rocks the funniest show generate shows more funding this and that drove them there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some other yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride well my favorite shows of all time course\nBut it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] you know have their mission statement affected like break the system sneak in the back there\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know but I think hard about it because there's a there's a part of me that's also like if something like that were to happen like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know nobody doubting ... or my indie credibility at this point like I think anyone who knows\nMy work would say that guy spent years bending over backwards to try to do that thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had visibly quit and other people fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I could move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel out of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to be because I I feel like one of the things I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in had to just kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them do not have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen so that's\nAnother thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs that could give me that credibility and that could bring some other stuff into the world's but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody to us right [noise]\nIt's ...

B. O. like that's a more a bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah southern copier credits pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claimed to be this rebel tried to ah throw rocks from outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that\nBut I don't really know what else I Am\nAre you worried that you're not going to get this or light show and you're going to have to move to CBS andme in large ...\nOh my God that was your own bigger theatre should follow that man's life I Would be so that I often\nI don't know I just read a biography of Batman sound horrible feeling quite frankly I can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture all ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant out of Fox genius\nUh [laughter] ... has been thrilled about now are the things we read about\nThe actual um loneliness that doesn't seem great but I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major concern of mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk would he be sites because in my mind a lot of what's behind it is\nNot talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone and still is weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there used to be the element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable\nMuch more controlled and that's okay but I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nLetterman you sometimes just like get a permit to shut down the block so he could pour ten thousand rubber balls off the roof of his duty onto the street and that was that no thought about it beyond that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
