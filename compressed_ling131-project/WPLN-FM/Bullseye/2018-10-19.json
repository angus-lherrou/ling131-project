[noise]\n\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse foreign I'm so excited to welcome Susan Orlean back to our show\nChoosing is a staff writer at the New Yorker she's also appeared in vogue and Esquire on this American Life she's the author eight books covering topics like New England Saturday Night in America an orchid fanatics last one the or could be ended up being the basis of the Academy Award nominated film\nAdaptation Susan is uh disarming interviewer a meticulous researcher and a beautiful writer\nThese days she lives here in Los Angeles where we make our show and being an author and to read or she has visited the beautiful historic central libraries here dozens and dozens of touch\nHer latest book is about that library and its history and particularly about the devastating fire that almost demolish the librarian Nineteen eighty six the book is also\nKind of a pay on to libraries everywhere will demean her with us why every library is a vital institution the book is called the library book it's one of my favorites I read this year Susan Orlean a welcome back troubles are always happens\nYou it's great to be with you Susan what\nIs your relationship with libraries personally of in your obvious financial relationship\n[laughter]\nOne would hope um well I grew up going to the library that was very much a part of my childhood and my parents were great\nLibrary doors they didn't really believe in buying books they I think they felt like why would you buy a book you go to the library and borrow the book and if that's not in you put your name on a whole list and you get it when it's available\nAnd they were born in the depression and I'm sure that's a lot of it which is that buying books seem like a bit of an indulgence that wasn't necessary\nI grew up going to the library a couple of times a week with my mom and I found it\nAbsolutely magical it was not like going to a bookstore or a toy store it was partly because there was no money there was no financial relationship and when your kid the idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAnd a library is was on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle\nRight [laughter] well and I do think that in the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more conscious a kind of call it the Starbucks effect we've become conscious of\nHow\nHome and there's your workplace and there's kind of a desire for another place somewhere to go somewhere to see other humans and just sort of share the space with them\nIt's I think it's why people go to co working space is I think it's why people go to public parks even if they've got a backyard there's something very special about being somewhere around other people and you're not there to interact\nAnd that's definitely some quality of libraries I mean they're they're closest analog is probably a public park\nYou have written for the New Yorker for thirty some years and ah and you're a New Yorker for a long time how did your experience of living in Los Angeles\nCompared to your expectations about Los Angeles [noise] I had\nTravelled here a lot over the years before I moved here and ... had been downtown once as far as I knew [noise]\nUm my expectation of Los Angeles was that I Would never spend time downtown and at the time I moved here which is now seven years ago [noise]\nDowntown was just on the brink of really changing and revitalizing and re populating [noise]\nI never imagined that I Would be doing a book about the library I moved to Los Angeles because my husband was asked to help with the company and that was starting up and we thought well that'd be fun and we'll go for a year or get some nice weather and go back to New York at the end of the year\nIn the course of being here I was given a tour of the downtown library and first of all I thought oh my God this building is amazing it's a beautiful building and a very eccentric interesting piece of architecture Nineteen twenties era but [noise]\nInflicted with all of this sort of addiction and Moroccan kind of a aesthetic it's it's a really interesting building so I was kind of struck immediately just about\nWhat it called building it was and how I had never been downtown to see it [noise]\nBut walking through the library and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told\nSome of the stories of of various city librarians who had run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric fascinating figures and\nI found myself just being drawn and more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing place somebody should write about this\nNot thinking that somebody was me [noise] um and right at a moment the person giving me the tour had pulled one of the books off the shelf and took a deep whiff of the book\nI thought well I guess I'm In a new city where people do things like smells books and I I kind of dismissed it until he said well you can still smell the smoke and some of them\nAnd I thought how they used to let people smoke in the library that seem very bold and I said look you know was this back when they allowed smoking and he said\nMore with Susan Orlean after\nA quick break but he never convicted anyone starting the Nineteen eighty six library fire Susan will tell me why when she started her library book she thought she could solve the cash it's bull's eye for maximum fund dot org and NPR\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]

publications says well her books include the orchid the fringe in June and Saturday Night her newest tells the story of the Los Angeles public library and so much more it's called the library book hits bookstores this week the arsenic\nThat our son had been the cause of the fire who was the person who was accused of having started at\nA young man in his twenties named Harry peak who was um\nI guess predictably a wannabe actor\nErrand boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing [noise] um [noise] was well what what happened was he had told a number of friends that he had started the fire so very quickly ... ah [noise]\nOnce there was a reward\nAssociated with anyone having providing a tip for solving the fire a one of his friends good to have friends like that came forward and\nUm basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up\nI'm interviewing him to figure out whether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're in fact true\nBecause she was a charming liar he\nWas from every description I had from anybody he was an immensely likeable guy charming and just a crazy favor own would just fed up about stupid thing not just the tip he'd say where where have you been to I was having drinks who share\nYou know he just couldn't tell us straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him and at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all use that exact expression he would give you the shirt off his back he was\nThe love and and also drove them crazy\nSo in a way this is what might be called a\nTrue crime narrative I guess\nAnd I wonder if you felt pressured by the fact that you were telling their crime story to have a narrative that resolved comfortably to provide an answer to the question\nI I did I first of all I thought I'm going to solve this which is utterly veins [laughter] that there is no way that a civilian with no access to\nThe evidence and no knowledge of how to investigate in arson would be able to crack the case but that was my first thought is I'm going to solve this [noise] um and\nMaybe if you had a ragtag band friends it right and ... van\nHas come on guys and a big dog right isn't that the that we do ... but I'm\nI'm fairly comfortable with the idea that\nI don't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be\nOut of the reality of so many of the things I write about don't have a tidy conclusion or don't resolve and the way that I might have expected them to resolve in this case I think following the different possible outcomes it's a bit of a choose your own adventure and [noise]\nAnd you come to your own conclusion essentially a because there's no way to reexamine\nWhat I\nTried to do is lay out all the different paths of thought that could lead you to a conclusion [noise]\nIt may be that when I wrote the orchid safe and I was determined to see it goes to work at it and as time is growing short and I thought oh my God the book is ruined I'm never going to see a ghost shortcut and I finally had a deadline that I had to make\nAnd I didn't see one\nSuddenly it seemed like well of course I'm not going to see one\nThat's that's the point it's\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never match the anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and in its own way and I felt\nI mean it is the reality it is the fact is without giving anything away it's it's not possible to come to a conclusion I mean my my notion that I Would solve it being something that very quickly I realize that's nuts but\nIt isn't possible to ultimately now what happened and\nI was comfortable finally thinking that's OK I'm giving you the different paths of thought and and um maybe you see the one of them being the persuasive one\nWell Susan Arlene I really loved your book and I always love having on the show thank you so much for coming over and taking the time Oh thank you it's a pleasure [noise]\nSusan Orlean her book the library books it's bookstores this week I loved it so much it's one of those books where\nSusan is such a keen eye for character detail and details of story but when I was reading in fact my wife I Would\nPick out just a little thing that Susan wrote on every page and force my wife to listen to me reading it she uh that is Susan came to max one kind of a couple of years ago this event that we put on once a year and she gave a talk or called\nFinding the extraordinary in the ordinary and it was about how\nShe feels like she can go to almost any place and find something special a story that's worth writing in that place and [noise]\nShe's such a remarkable person that I\nBelieve she can do it by you can watch that talk totally for free or on the maximum fun YouTube channel or just by searching for Susan Orlean max funk on [noise] and of course we'll post a link to that on the bulls eye pitch at maximum for that or [noise]\nIt's ...

I Am Jesse foreign my guess Gregory Porter is a Grammy winning jazz singer and songwriter his latest album Nat King Cole and me is out now\nI mean to me the incredible thing about that can cause records is you know he's\nSo profoundly alligator as a as a musician and as a man as well I met her gorgeous guy yeah yeah but\nA man for whom you know his career as a black entertainer who was working in uh the you know broad pop music\nWorld in the early Nineteen fifties you know he was very unusual and ... and his manner is characterized by kinda forbearance you know like all of those\nAll those slings and arrows are translated into a feeling of like no matter what\nI Am transcend that it's something that is like on inspiring about him you know\nYou know it's also I think for a lot of people it's the thing that they at least connect with about him because they wish she was mad about it yeah\n[laughter] net for me you know people talk about well how did he was he expressed in himself a in a in a\nIn a way that it ... Vance or\nYou know black people but ... you know you can you could say that just by checking out some of the things that he uh\nYou know how forceful was he was he on the front lines of in in in marching\nJest his being there\nHis eloquence his genius ... this is a thing that knew exactly who he was he was the doctors of dark\nHe knew he exactly who he was and he knew he was you know there was a perception of the perceived threat and his blackness but he took it and he graced it so beautifully\nAnd even if it even affected some of the songs that she chose to sing the idea of singing love songs to love\nLove songs to humanity a universal love\nSmile nature boy\nPick yourself up this type of song in a way is is uniquely connected to him because they love songs to love and to life and that's just profoundly affected me but in a way it was a thing that he in some in some way had to do because\nYou know swooning after Nat King Cole was not a popular thing\nFor you know many parents many people's minds at the time you know in some ways I called him the the original Iraq Obama because he he knew who he was and he knew how he had to\nThis world and he knew he had to do it with grace\nAnd he did and he still got his message across now I think about you know people think about his his lyrics and it was like always you know he's in the sky and he's he's you know just so you know milk toast and sweet but\nThink about a song like pick yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again think about that song for somebody who had been pushed down who had been mistreated\nWho had been punched kicked bitten in the civil rights struggle pick yourself up just yourself off start all over again means something totally different to them totally different it means something totally different than my mother\nSmile though you're hard as they can mean something totally different to her you know uh\nTo to the people that are on the underneath to the people who haven't been pushed down many a net songs means something totally different it's encourage them it is optimism and I'm so\nWhen we talk about his contribution to people that are on the underneath you absolutely have to consider\nThese these lyrics that I hear now and that they still four to five people you have to think of that um so he had he had a great great contribution you know first a first black men have his OWN TV show and and uh\nYou know just the experiment of that was really something extraordinary for and if you know for an American culture that that wasn't a wasn't so open to that and\nWell let's hear my guess Gregory Porter singing pick yourself up his most recent record is called Nat King Cole and make\nYourself a\nTake a deep breath [noise]\nJust just a small\nStart all over again [noise]\nI have a\nPhone when much on round [noise]\nThought oh man [noise]\nI'm Jesse Owens those goals I my guess is the jazz singer and fried of Bakersfield, California Greg reporter\nI hear you often compared to bill whether you know go where there's you know maybe my favorite ever\n[laughter] you know what I'm saying like it would be careful with those ...\nI'm a child and that's the you know that's that's the grandpa and you know I I've spoken to a couple\nOf times now and he's a you know she's a brilliant brilliant man in general not just musically and one of the things that I think ties are your art and his is that both of you were\nMen when you\nIn artist kicked off your careers you know do what they said song in the navy but he was ... he was a career in the navy now you know he didn't he didn't put out his first record until he was about thirty yeah you are in your late thirties when you're ... yeah\nAnd that is a very different perspective on the world than the perspective of\nYou know even even when it's about falling in love it's about a different kind of falling in love that when you're sixteen yeah yeah ... when you're sixteen that's also great\n[laughter] I didn't know what to say when I was sick\nYou know having a life seasoning and and and ups and downs can or can't inform me off your art Blount there's some power and energy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bullseye", "city": "Nashville", "day": "19"}
