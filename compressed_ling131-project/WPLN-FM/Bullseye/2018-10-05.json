I'm Talking with Kyle and Jack of tenacious D. they have a new animated series that just dropped called post apocalyptic do you can watch it on YouTube did you guys you know what tenacious D. was like early on and doing tenacious stay\nI mean here's the thing ... aside from the friendship and the the the uh the mentor ship that was happening there there was also I felt\nEarly on that there was a chemistry there that just the idea in my mind I mean ... going on stage\nBecause it was inevitable that we were going to go on stage at some point soon and perform our act whatever it was going to be and I had a feeling in my bones that the two of us together just the image of his face\nAnd my face up on stage together that there was something undeniably hilarious about it while I'm being funny and wrong and wonderful man I did not see but he didn't say that I felt it in my thumb [laughter] [noise]\nWell we didn't even perform\nProper like in a club or like four years armed with the actors gang at a at a coffee house you know on high on no longer there highland ground ground so and we named our so on on our first concert there\nThere wasn't a concert it was like we were part of a variety show yeah and we got like five minutes slot in that show and we named ourselves and\nPart of our slot was naming the band and we gave the audience a multiple choice\nAnd a one of them was gorgeous sons miss just\nAnother one was pets are mean to ... ... based on the amazing documentary by Michael Moore and responsive corresponds with corn for those and then a bubble was biblical tales about bows biblical theater and tenacious D. and in the audience who was in the audience that day prophetic\nTime now for our segment the song that changed my life this time Jose James Jose is a singer from Minneapolis and while he works a lot in jazz\nCollaborating with folks like Chico Hamilton Chris Bowers just to name a couple he's also kind of a genre Polly math his effort to go beyond jazz hip hop electronic music and now so [noise]\nFor your [noise]\nOh You're welcome to do [noise]\nFor his latest album James is taking on one of the great Bill James new album lean on me features twelve rendition of his favorite bill whether she tracks the one you're listening to right now is huge meant he recorded it right here in Los Angeles where we make the show to Capitol\nRecords famous studio be but not before getting bill withers blessing of course he got that from a legend over dinner so when we asked him to talk about the song that changed his life you'd think he might go with a bill withers song right\nBut instead he picked love and happiness a classic from another all time great soul singer ... okay let's go to say\nMy introduction to Al Green I'm anybody major probably laugh at this was actually watching pulp fiction\nEverybody knows the scenes you know where\nYou know the gangster Rochelle this while issues\nBeing introduced and you know they're playing this this cool seventies soul music\nFingers but\nRight now you got ability\nPainful as it may be\nFact the lights ... jazz is going to have to get realistic about\nAny any acquaintance is such a genius for using music and he's in it crazy ways you know ... ... this whole tradition of how soul music is use or in these gangster movie and he's black gangster movies and it was so cool you know and and immediately made me want to\nLearn who was that singer what was the sound what was this behind the scenes\nIn the business was filled to the brim with an unrealistic [noise]\nWho thought they asked what age like one\nHave you made in terms of vinegar\nHave you made it gets better when they get dumped [noise]\nHad to go by the soundtrack to pulp fiction and I went to the electric fetus which was princes favorite record store in Minneapolis that's where I pretty much you know build my entire collection from jazz to hear about\nIt was and remains to this day it just an amazing record shop in a man to see how\nOpen it up and that's how I was let stay together by Al Green said okay who's out great\nYou know and then I found out and\n[noise] and then this one track eleven happiness just completely you know grab me and it took me you know another direction Mm\n[noise] Mm\nWell happen were coming from a jazz background I'm I'm always looking for something a little bit more sophisticated and loving happiness starts out of town and robot and it's just he's just singing loving happy and the you know\n\nAnd then that foot stop comes in you know on a box that that\nThat he didn't do that and it was like oh okay I was a student or a jazz standard which are very clever and you know a verbal spend [noise]\nYou know this was quite different you know just dating again love unhappiness okay and you're like wait a minute something's going wrong oh man come\nAnd go do some one of those rooms with\nWith the drama you know some was on the phone three o'clock in the morning and like that kind of rhyme commercial hip hop I loved that immediately you know can you help us along get three o'clock in the ... own from a lot of phone you know\nYou're talking about she can make it like that such an intriguing line that I was already hooked 'cause I'm a I'm a lyricist and uh whereas you know\nBeing in the long game [noise] one day\nHas been [noise]\nAt that point I was really a jazz jazz and all that much about so an orange\nI didn't understand it our brain actually started as a jazz singer and I found out you know Leon where Marvin Gaye where there's all these guys started asking if they had a certain kind of jazz information and your hair out in the very beginning go up and hold that no no\nJust hold it forever that could be like Sarah Vaughan\nWe'll be\nGallons bash the job in teams to walk away\nWhen\nHe got this record for high record in Memphis and there were no very distinctive [noise] one of the distinctive things about the sessions that Iraq has red hot as brothers teeny ideas on guitar Charles on Oregon's rewrite on base and\nWe had the legendary al Jackson on most syndrome sessions and that\nWidow section was so legendary they were responsible for you know cranking out so many years of that era and what strikes me about how they recorded they're strapped to our brains vocal and it's very raw may come home I\nDo\nDoo doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo can attach to\n[noise] you\nKnow ... you know I was used to the Michael Jackson which is very ... you know there's like there's like three lead vocals and it's a very smooth and there's like reverb in all these things this is just one might you can tell you know he's in the room with them you know what I mean\nI Love it because it really conveys all of the motion delivery it captures every new on this is almost like documentary recording like it's obviously was a huge hit but it's like this is a moment of him just jamming with these guys and performing you know he's really for forming starting to feel that energy\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis track open my eyes to a third path and me you know I knew about jazz which to me he was about learning the standards of item off of the changes\nAnd I knew about kind of more power you know I wasn't a rapper you know I didn't have the skills to be an assay\nAnd this is like a third path it's like you could be a singer songwriter like our brains but it's still full of jazz information and still walking and direct and I don't know just a light bulb went off and it made sense\nThat you love [noise] say Jay with the song that changed his life\nHis new album is lean on me it's a great collection of bill weather's coverage and it's out now I really think James is one of the great singer is going right now but take a listen to one more song off of his new record this one is lovely day\nWill be doing something with long enough [noise] parents having only might\nNot look at using ... and the world's\nRight [noise] just one look at me and I\nDon [noise] people\nIt's ... I'm Jesse ... no usually we closed bowl side with uh\nI write but I saw some great stand up comedy the other day and the comic Ted Alexandros ... but I could share it with you here so I'm going to do that it was recorded a few weeks ago at the comedy cellar in front of the same brick wall that Lucy case do it in ... when he returned to stand up stage", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "05"}
