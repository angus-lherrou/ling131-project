S. and work ruby says Sandy's\nCase to stay here is a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to port Isabel Sandy also told Rudy about her four sons she hadn't seen them in about a month she described a moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me is that the card so they had to take her baby away\nAnd she said but I'm Still breastfeeding and you know [noise] and there's a does it matter she snow but I'm I'm breastfeeding and they said oh itself to take 'em and\nDid our [noise] God Forbid took breast feeding him a baby [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] I don't know what else to say about that\n\nI was never able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone Sandy happened to call while I was visiting\nYou'll does apartment in Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\nPart of our\nFamily and ended up how are you my daughter\n[noise] factor that I'm\nLike Sandy says she's desperate to leave I left his ... did you talk to the kids mummy\nCalled\n\nSandy tells you all the that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with her she asks if you'll have been able to talk with him\nHe may have to get all it'd be a ... a a meal that yes because on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids and he said mummy he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go with you and me\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished it's the children to [noise] when Sandy says that's your the looks like she's about to cry\nNow that that means you know the ... the truth me I don't have words for you I understand you as a mother\n\nAnd he tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the warmth of his mother\nDo say has to see them in yes that was something else to children complained about that they don't let the kids how the baby not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old school Michael seemingly how is it possible that they don't let them hug each other you know how that'd be a new styles that but I they are brothers they have never been apart\n\nWould torment Sandy is that the baby's finally getting old enough to recognize people but the only people he's seeing are strangers\n... you have to face my daughter came in because it's the saddest thing for a mother to be separated from her children have federal menial\nOkay man what a name that they at the New York I think I have not checking me out of that might have a good night we'll talk to more okay ... okay blessings make we can and they have anything in our family by my sweet girl\n[laughter]\n\nYou'll just got her own story to tell just to one that connect to Sandy's to hit us and the way\nShe says her family's been persecuted in Guatemala for generations I mean she loves her shirt to show me a scar that runs across her stomach skins wow you got to see what it looks like she was cut in half and selling back together you would have been for years she's avoided looking at it in the mirror every stick\nWith us we put up a sign use maybe allowing it does put on them ... to me that I have been\nShe tells me it's a reminder of when she was kidnapped raped and tortured and killed his family was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she in Sandy were targeted its ... who encouraged Sandy to ask for asylum do everything legally\nBut now that Sandy and the kids are locked up in a part you'll just says it feels like the whole and filing thing was a lie\nI reached out to ice and customs and border protection but they couldn't answer my question why did the government takes Sandy's kids this summer when there's no evidence that you cross the border illegally\nAnd it wasn't just Sandy many parents who were never prosecuted for this we're still separated from their kids there are dozens of examples lifted in a lawsuit against the government\nThe American civil liberties union is suing the Trump Administration over for separations of us\nSee it was filed back in February months before family separation was really in the new\nCases famous now it's called miss el versus ice in court documents the administration to try to explain why it's separated those parents parents who hadn't been accused of entering the country illegally reading through you can see the government's arguments shift\nVersus it says it's separated the plaintiff and child because I wasn't sure they were really related\nBut they were that was proven by a DNA test so then the government argues different reasons about why they needed to be separated those arguments worn enough to persuade the court the judge ruled that this type of family separation went\nBeyond it's lawful reach in the end I Can't tell you why the government separate uh children from parents like Sandy all I Know for sure is it wasn't about a crackdown on illegal immigration it wasn't about the Trump Administration enforcing the law\nBecause many families didn't break it\nLate yesterday or those California judge of Bush appointed by the way issued a nationwide injunction ordering immigration agents today several new steps first\nIn late June the judge in that court case issued an injunction now there was a deadline a ticking clock the government would have to reunite families who've been separated whether they cross illegally are not kids would need to be back with their parents within thirty days the youngest even sooner\nDeadline to reunite the and get some migrant children with their family now less than a week away\nSeparating families was one thing because the government put them back together it wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that it was a massive logistical challenge we're talking about thousands of children in shelters across the country parents locked up thousands of miles away how is this going to happen\nThere are reports of math confusion surrounding this process joining us now is Alex is are the health and Human Services secretary Mr Secretary thank you for your time this morning there does seem to be a lot of confusion on this matter what can you tell us this morning declare some of that up\nAbout ... thank you uh first off there's absolutely no confusion on our part uh we have the kids and we're working to comply with the court's order and what that involves you know we've\nThat the government says everything's fine but with a deadline of July tend to just a few days away we call Sandy's mom you'll do [noise]\nOr something like\n... has no idea what's going to happen next I don't know what that tells me\nThere's a lot of confusion she's had trouble reaching Sandy and attention and now she has to hand over documents reading she's related to the grand kids\nYou're already or you'll know it doesn't know\nWhen or if Sandy will see the kids again and if they're all back together how would they get to ...\nOn it yet the letter of the other\nDay before the deadline the Trump Administration admits it's not going to make it maybe only half the youngest children will be reunited with their parents Denny's cancer in a shelter for migrant children in Phoenix, Arizona it's run by a Texas based company called southwest key so I call it the company\n[noise] Hi sister she just needed to teach them or quarter calling from the Texas Tribune how are you gonna\nThat's Jeff ... a spokesman for southwest key many of the kids separated at the border are staying at southwest key shelters\nMine says whether ... years so there's about the plans for resigning as you know these are the shelters with what they were watching the court room where you are and what do you hear on the next job surely officer British secure so okay so it does that mean that you haven't heard any plans to step away from them\nNext steps from the office of refugee result I Would imagine that you all would have liked to get some information about how those people to transport it that's just what I'm trying to figure out [noise] or waiting is I I got nothing more than we're waiting on direction from the office of
