thousand vermouth for not voting and not responding to notices\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this

have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a writer and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate Abad or how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\n\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know on October the first that there is a presidential election or a gubernatorial election and uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and it back to presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that they they are standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the polling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. V. E. in ... poodle from a PM reports [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm\n\nWhen it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking\nNo I Would not counted as hacking or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming up next on review\n[noise]\n\nJournalism we're always working on things right up until the deadline our radio stories are interviews are daily news cast it's nonstop juggle and these past few weeks that's also included preparing for the pledge drive\nBut it's an important part of our year as important as the journalism we do because it's what makes that journalism possible without the ...\nOperation we wouldn't be able to produce pod cats like curious Nashville and promise and we wouldn't be able to host live events like movers in thinkers more than Ninety percent of the money that it takes to run Nashville public radio comes from individual donors in under writers in our community\nBut you don't have to be like us you don't have to wait until the deadline to make your pledge you can call now it's six one five seven six so twenty tent or visit W. P. L. N. dot org and when you become a sustaining number you'll be helping us out even more your automatic contribution means one less thing to juggle thank you for your support\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. and this is revealed an outlet up till now we've been talking about all the barriers\nThat prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely on\nTouch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has been indicted twelve Russian agents\nForce them to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hacking Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country but are the people in charge of elections there actually listening [noise] reveals buyer Duncan picks up the story\n[noise] yeah yeah so right now I'm In the machine in movie land has a voting machine in his living room this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine is bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and a Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch litter and then it's the compressed being the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that will chime in the beginning and use that as Irene came\n[laughter] this is a direct recording electronic machine or ... it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines as paper ballot and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paper less voting machines in this country\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studies\nThe arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically our a virus and part of the tree the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree [noise]\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where can people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting have our ballot over electronic wind for the mid term elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\n[noise] I'm going to read just a little bit from the order [noise]\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Schoenberg was having none of that how can she wrote is here to stay in quote defendants will failed to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia for research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems and machines but very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg was ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\nReveals by those who brought us the story [noise]\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp Savage to commission to look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms they use touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country where the where is that fear coming from that's next on the view from the center for investigative reporting T. R. [noise]\n\n\nMost of the year the national public radio newsroom is not asking for money because frankly we're too busy for that\nWere busy going out into the community and talking to people and investigating government documents and telling you what we've learned through sound rich audio stories but a few times a year were asked to slow down and reflect on why this local journalism even exists and the first place\nAnd we're asking you to do the same because it is not an accident that we have some of the best radio reporters in the country right here in Nashville it came about because we haven't generous listeners who've decided that they want to hear the kinds of stories we produce\nIt's a beautiful network of people who are holding up the station I encourage you to join that network by making a pledge of support go to W. piano dot org slash give or called six twenty five seven six zero twenty ten and thank you for your support we really appreciate it\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in pie or at least is reveal I'm allergic to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud ... people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people lose claims\nHave been totally ... but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have\nOh it's worse for bars liquor over\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything that you will with Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey beg hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has this big national profiles conservative circles how did that happen\nSo called about is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nThat way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could drew a bunch of the little zeroes in percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice\nIt would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed ... book lists them or what was the looking person\nWell you know come on makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every ...\n... they are using the\nTerm line as an actor and it's not off line then you will thrill all these studies in statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system\nIt's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agree to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U. S.\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free\nThey share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registration and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage\nSo Kobach uses cross check system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where Kobach signed in using\nAs a Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "24"}
