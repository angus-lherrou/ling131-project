paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents

this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine is bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan booted up\nSays act you touch the litter emitted decompress and the image is the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that little chime at the beginning and you go to every time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or D Ari it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cyber security tightened that's a major red flag\nIn fact dairies have been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballot and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden\nFor homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen you wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the

disagree with is strongly Mac\nBernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studies the arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this tree the way it is set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the ...\nNot long

a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic one for the midterm elections\nJudging Amy Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\n[noise] I'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites stretch Totenberg was having none of that\nHow can she wrote is here to stay in quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia for research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nTo people I talked to said that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight to ... and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan and I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at

R.\nToday we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nIn many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that there was like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people\nThose claims have been totally ... one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that typically a pretty sweep you off is he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe constitution bars or keep them from making pretty over\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning trouble pointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey begging hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has his big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging elections\nThat way we know that that is not true\nThat is right now I could drew a bunch of the little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's the leader in the fight against his well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed her book lists them or what was he like in person\nWell you know come on makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he\nWill tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term and you guys have had it would be the ... ... if you're using the term line as an actor and it's not off line then you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument and I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and\nThen he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agree to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U. S.\nOkay so how does this thing work so about two dozen\nThey share information between state keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registration and most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage\nSo how does Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud this is\nWhere Kobach signed in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done in all these other states", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
