just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon Kennedy arrow uses a lot to hammer them\nBernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of marijuana\nLouisiana has one of the strongest repeat offender laws in the U.S and in New Orleans that can put a man in prison for a possible Twenty years to life for stealing candy bars to Kobe Bryant\nMonitored or\nI've never met Conrad son prince in person but we talk on the phone and say that again\nYeah princes in a jail that's over five hours from New Orleans where he's from the phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and nice and spends his days along with over a hundred other men [noise] we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out [noise]\n\nThat my hair down did you say [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\nBlow out the d._a. promised me an interview for this story but he never gave it to me I asked over and over and each time he declined\nBut I did talk to a bunch of people from all different sides of the courtroom the first person used to work for Ken is there out as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you a da\nWell in regular years a seven years but India is it feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for tennis arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statue back then\nI was in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I Would it was just there was a standard was as the law office relied or a better way of describing it it was just the way it was\nSo basically any time that you could use that that you often are statutes it was the policy that the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's this mindset that the more people we locked up in the more time that we give people the more we're going to stop the crime problem punished for this one was one of the finest shoes you know harsh sentences or the turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says Ken is there is office still uses the vigil offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at is the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your ...\nThat's just started very way you talk to the prosecutor and the judge is even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge Marlene parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nWas this little light black or right this is a life\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nTakes away the ... function of the judge\nWas used to fashion as soon as that support is just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the vigil offender statute judges no longer decide how long a person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kick in the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wore that treatment is that they're going to be part of the census whether it's a bit of other steps as soon as the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away and [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da na ... just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon can is arrow\n... oh you did you ever been to San jose oh wow I'll be going on ... street\nHeller more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports against Ghana there it was private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da da da da da\nDa da da to that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything or there's public safety can you serpent started with no charm a Jew or goes public safety really demand tunnel ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what ... does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nA I never heard back and an email the ds spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... Russian to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom what you're saying it's like ... has the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken as always emphasizes this oh his duty\nNot his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I have what I consider to be a profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not that it is it is a law I think\nFacts in fact support that in other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing and New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nFor Kennedy arose line is I'm just doing my job why does he do his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken Israel's\nThan I Am ... a coal criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a Jew Jew a big you would do a ... a ...\nYou know this is ... ...
