turn to jeopardy and someone's head is visible through the window [noise]\nThe races feeling like there's no longer worth voting there and I think that's what we're we're we're in trouble with\nVan Angela asks about a name she spotted on the purge list\nKathleen Parker oh yeah yeah they didn't want her side\nShe's Monti mhm\nState record say Kathleen ponder register to vote in two thousand eight then earlier this year officials struck her name from the rolls river and ponder tells us he doesn't know about any of this but does he and know that she's been taken off the voting\nList [noise] Angela and I find ms ponder living in a small house just outside multiply\nAnd famous fined\nI'm handling completely I'm a reporter with public radio has our\nStory about people who than removed from the voter last I don't know if you've heard about this like\nAngela explains how Georgia cancels voters who don't turn out in multiple elections and then in some places blacks are being pulled off the rolls at a disproportionate rates\nSo you registered to vote in two thousand and eight years I've heard that ... year member\nA hand in my mind\nNo divorce making what I mean\nThen I last July you were taken off the voter lists I Would have been on July twenty eighth of twenty Seventeen hands but you didn't get any notification that you'd\nBe anything from this you know\nDid you know there is a policy that they take us if you don't\n\nMiss ponder tells us she had no idea she'd been purged although she didn't seem completely surprised she says she hasn't been a regular voter but she's thinking about turning out in November to support Stacey Abrams for governor\nAre over there will be able to do back at Reverend ponders office angel it gives him the news about his aunt\nShe still lives within the county but she's been removed from the voter last and she had no idea\n... that's interesting is she was never notify or anything\nShe doesn't recall ever getting anything from election officials\nHuh I think we need to get down to the bottom of it because if it happened to her to Rome which is you know no\nThat voter suppression is happening\nAnd almost give people to read mine said that this is a ... not right and so now anything that is a privilege as they get permission and so if you don't do our way we will give you permission to use his privilege\nHe says he'll take is on to re register so she can vote in the governor's race [noise]\n\n\nWe analyze all the people purged in Georgia just last year and we found that about a hundred thousand removed for not voting and not responding to notice\nNow we don't know how it breaks down by race but if you add in other obstacles like a voter id law enclosed polling places all this could tip a close race for governor\nWhen it comes to the perjury\nIs Stacey Abrams and other Democrats said there is this illusion let people register all the way to election day at least Seventeen states have same day registration but not in Georgia Brian Kemp opposes it and same with other Republicans\nIn states where you have the same day registration it leads to irrational voting\nBrian Robin ... is a Republican strategist I meet him in the marble halls of Georgia State house brands he's voting as a write in their privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is outright period\nBrian thanks registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou aren't people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's at a magistrate of headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate Abad or how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI don't know how you describe it frankly I'm at a loss all all that but if you don't know an October the first so there is a presidential election or a gubernatorial election in uh the first two weeks of November you're not an informed voter\nBrian argues purging people for not voting isn't taking anything from them because they're not voters\nLike if if the presidential election and it back to presidential elections don't get you out I don't know what it's going to take to get you out and I don't care what color you are what your partisanship is I think that's fair standard\nBrian looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls can wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes going at each other you look at the polling today there's almost no one decided [noise]\n\nThat story from Johnny Kauffman of public radio station W. A. B. E. and Angela ... poodle from a PM report [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm\n\nWhen it comes to voting something else distinguishes Georgia from most other states it's voting machines are easy targets for computer hackers was what you were doing here even technically hacking\nNo I Would not counted as acting or what was it then [noise] it was it was browsing the Web site that's coming\n[noise]\n\nOff the beaten path studio tour present is nineteenth annual self guided our tour where visitors connect with local artists and craftsmen are unique working environments in dekalb and Ken and counties near center hill lake this year's tour features fourteen stops and more than twenty eight artists and clay\nGlass paper would Leiber and metals artist studios are open from ten to five October twenty six through the twenty eighth tour of math and details at off the beaten path studio tour dot com\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in P. R. ... this is revealed an outlet up till now we've been talking about\nAll the barriers that prevent people from stepping into a voting booth on election day like getting to the polling station in finding out your name is on the list\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely\nOn touch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have learned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nOne of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting called paper not\nHighly complex computers paper\nThere's a real cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for ... to target county Web sites in Georgia a lot of security experts are worried that when it comes to hacking Georgia is one of the most vulnerable states in the country\nBut are the people in charge of election they're actually listening reveals buyer Dunkin' picks up the story\n[noise] yeah yeah so ah right now I'm like in the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine it's bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and a Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch litter and then it became pressing the image is the one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that little chime at the beginning and you go to every time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity type that's a major red flag\nIn fact dairies had been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paper or less voting machines in this country\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different security systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly Mac Bernhardt is a\nPHD student at the University of Michigan he studies the arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of this treaty the way it is set up is that that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the ...\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic winds for the mid term elections\nJudge ... filed an order in favor of Brian ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order [noise]\nState's pace in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Schoenberg was having none of that\nTalking she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia for research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nTo people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker\nGot the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg ruin resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this [laughter] uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\n\nReveals by Dr brought us the story [noise]\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission to look at options for policing the curb voting system by twenty twenty oh in the other four states heading into the midterms they use touch screen machines with no paper audit trail or New Jersey Delaware South Carolina in Louisiana [noise]\n\n\n\nFear of voter fraud is driving a lot of efforts to restrict access to voting around the country where the where is that fear coming from that's next on the view from the center for investigative reporting PR [noise]\n\n\nWhen we created our podcasts the promise I had no idea how listeners would react 'cause they relate to the struggles and triumphs of Nashville's low income community would they empathize\nWell hundreds of thousands of downloads leader I sort of know the answer\nPeople want to connect they want to know each other take ... for example camera loved how we put a human face to the big thorny issues facing the city and she'd come to our annual pod cast party to meet one in particular\nAnd I came today 'cause I heard that big man's going to be here\nCelebrities people's asked name you live in Nashville you run into celebrities oh yeah a WPN\nLine that we strive to bring the voices that too often going hurt and if they become celebrities in your eyes wow that's amazing to support these efforts then make a pledge keep that work going by calling six twenty five seven six zero twenty ten or visit WPN and one daughter work\nFrom the center for investigative reporting in pie or at least is reveal um outlets today we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud people are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been\nSaying in many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that there was just so that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theorist Alex millions and millions of people lose claims\nHave been totally ... but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary\nWe are pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nOr bars\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey beg hey yeah so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has this big national profile in conservative circles how did that happen\nSo Kobach is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who back to that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud Kobach claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this fraud could be swinging elections\nThat way we know that that is not true\nMuch right now I could do a bunch of little zeroes in percentages at you here but\nAccording to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed her book left arm or what was the looking person\nWell you know come what makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every ...\n... ... ... if you're\nUsing the term line as an actor and it's not off line then you will throw all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he still uses them\nIt's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument\nAnd I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford and then he also has this other big help it's a tool\nCalled the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registrations in the U. S.\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nOkay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different states\nSystem to go after voter fraud this is where\n... percent using cross check Kobus persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done and all these other states", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
