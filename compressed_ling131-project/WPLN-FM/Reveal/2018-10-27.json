found a way to restart testing of pregnant women\nFor ... and I feel this is so important to be able to identify because most of their patients who I think I Do not have any symptoms I think they are pregnant and they think they might be at risk for but the thing\nIs Carmen did an end run around Puerto Rico's health department she teamed up with the CDC to provide free testing for pregnant women it's the only program like it on the island\nSelf malice outweigh starting to think I think today and your ... on the first day back in the spring eight women had their blood drawn including Melissa

upbringing couple of years ago but the virus will always be there people need to protect themselves from mosquitoes and sexual transmission to avoid getting infected and\n... ... ... ...\n... ... in a moment we had back to the mainland Houston, Texas where a year after Hurricane Harvey people who are using a government program to pay for housing or getting the door shut in their faces and you're

not just about anatomy ... with the respiration some the heartbeat it's also about discovering days bussing living thing that is each month is what is ... what happens when we age we know like this much about\nPam knew her odds had just gone down and was tempted to turn back but she decided to wait for the woman with a fancy car to leave she went to the door and introduce yourself to the landlord\nSaid okay that's it and I have ... you know I Know you may or may not know about housing neo CEO type image but take this ... about it in and let me know if you go to work with me\nThe guy said okay you can rent this house and five years after pan and the kids moved in she bought her own house [noise]\n\nThis is why Pam does this work today why she's trying so hard for Denise in Cook County Illinois where Denise us from rejecting someone just because they have a section ... voucher is considered discrimination and it's illegal\nIt's also a legal and a handful of states including Massachusetts Oregon and New Jersey [noise]\nA few years ago Austin, Texas passed an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they banned any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can't be punished for it [noise]\nTwenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year that needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter does she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take our church and she got that what she she gave that to a certain extent but I don't know how to understand\nThe um [noise] the\nDiscrimination or part of it [noise]\nI don't want her to feel stereotype\nBecause of a voucher\nDenise was really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of the Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those have post so what's going on here why are so many landlords unwilling to take out or is in Texas\nRight of the nation of sexual as a discriminatory tool at all\nThis is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that less landlord saying no to section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacey on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits kind of alleging that discrimination against voucher holders what do you say to the\nUn disagree with that but I think the the voucher users in many situations you know they choose to live for their support group for their families were transportation word job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey ... about Denise\nShould just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe books it's reflective of all because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlords bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\nFor fuel for this lady or within those are the the cold to people with ms ...\nNest quest we heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad you sent officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and you're wanting to see if nests quest could really help people like Denny's so I'll let him take it from here\nHere in town that quest works they find landlords in areas with high rated schools who don't take vouchers then they make a pitch\nWhat does family with a voucher live here and we'll deal with the government for your\nTime rental payments those are automatic we also secure all the utilities for the unit ... not have to do anything\nThis Isabel Lopez executive director of nest quest\nAnd we also guarantee that the crime or maintain runners insurance on the unit [noise] um and then upon and move out we are willing to fit the bill for any damages\nWhen Isabelle took this job and that's quite a title one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhoods with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no to this and the first time we actually had it hard talking to landlord it was honestly it was really discouraging\nDoesn't affect the under ... square is the landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the ... or just that there's but there's still a lot\nWhat that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is the reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee\nThat everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it still that hesitation that I don't want to work with someone who's on section eight\nAs a mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places ness klutz help\nFive of them are staying in properties managed by the company Stacey hunt works for\nThat sort of thirty eight thousand units whose company managers in the Houston area five out of thirty eight thousand I talk to you about this you know it seems like cold comfort to somebody like Denise\nWhere it's a real like certain real one real to the day I mean we're we're ... the industry's Troy\nIn July three months after we first met Denise she was still looking for a place in her voucher was about to expire the deadline came and went but I couldn't get in touch with her\nAnd told me Denise was really stressed out and needed some space\nThen a few weeks later I got a Facebook invite from Pam she's holding this women's empowerment conference around the anniversary of the hurricane it's called I Survived it and Denise is going to be there sooner early September I drive down to Houston to this little church not far from his office [noise]\nMe neither\nI Walk inside and I see Pam at the front of the sanctuary gripping a microphone and piecing back and forth there's about a dozen people sitting in the pews dressed in their Sunday Best despite the Houston humidity hands got the crowd going yeah yeah\nHave seen a lot\nAmy about anything\nOther after her sermon I catch up with pastor pan can you just tell me a little bit what is this weekend about survivor\nIs the anniversary of the Harvey you know the one year after Harvey people still displaced people still going through things brings survivors together and share their story\nThe morning is packed with prayer and personal testimony is Denise gets up and talks about her struggles to find housing in a new city when we break for brunch I finally get a chance to ask her if she found an apartment she says yes\nAnd how do you like it just the way I think if if the cells of my head right now I won't complain the diplomatic way of putting it [laughter]\nI Walk complain it's mind\nDenise was not able to find the diverse mixed income neighborhood she was looking for when she left Chicago more than twenty percent of her new neighbors live below the poverty line and almost all of them are black or Hispanic and as for the apartment\nAnd they really almost look like the projects on child so let me as an ain't nothing but a group of people hang on a fixed income in holiday in one area ...\nThe high school her daughter goes to now got to be reading this year last year it got an F. I Will\nLeave in Texas no but am I going to be a net school zone\nBecause you're aiming higher most definitely I'm aiming within the next year you'd probably be comments to my home opening because that's my next though to be home owner [noise]\nTold me in spite of it all she's still seems to me as a success story a year after Hurricane Harvey ... she's got a roof over her head she recently got a raise at work\nIn just a few months and she's already decided not to renew it she wants to new places and Pam's already thinking about how to find her a better one [noise]\n\nThat's the way from teaching at Walter's with our partners at the Texas Tribune [noise]\nLike in Houston low income residents in North Carolina are having to put their lives back together after Hurricane Florence struck last month many are on their own\nI Am taking up I Am making arrangements for delivery I Am trying to figure out who can't cooked food I Am unloading trailer\nThat's next on revealed from the center for investigative reporting in P.
