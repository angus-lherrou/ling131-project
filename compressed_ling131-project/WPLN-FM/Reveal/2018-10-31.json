an ordinance like this but a few months later the state legislature overturned it and lawmakers went even further they ban any other city in Texas from doing the same thing\nBasically Texas landlords are allowed to discriminate against people with section ... vouchers and they can be punished for it [noise]\nIn Texas was one of the first states in the country to pass a law like this and twenty Fifteen Indiana did to the same year the needs to know about the law when she moved here\nDoes your daughter she understand that some people don't take vouchers and some people do take all churches

voucher\nWas really hoping to use her voucher and one of two suburban ZIP codes both majority white very low poverty better schools [noise]\nPut out of the Seventeen thousand families that get vouchers from the Houston housing authority we found that only thirty six were living in those opposed\nWhy are so many landlords unwilling to take out or is in Texas\nBut I don't think you know the utilization of section eight as a discriminatory tool at all\nThis is Stacey Hi he's on the board of the Houston apartment association and he supports that Texas law that lets landlords they noticed section eight\nAfter it passed housing advocacy group sued they said this is racial discrimination in disguise my colleague Edgar Walters interviewed Stacey on earlier this year and brought this up\nThere have been all these lawsuits kind of alleging that discrimination against voucher holders whether you say to that\nSo that they disagree with that but I think the the the voucher users in ... you know they choose to live where their support group for their families were transportation where the job is\nWe spoke to more than a dozen Dr holders and none of them told us that Andrew told Stacey Hi about Denise\nShe just heard from dozens and dozens of landlords you know like sorry we just don't accept section eight is discrimination or ... or stereotyping at least part of what's at issue\nThe book it's reflective of because everyone has to deal with you very stringent fair housing requirements all across this country\nStacey told Edgar there are plenty of legitimate reasons Texas landlords don't take vouchers the section eight program is run by government agencies that don't have enough staff and they are known to cut checks late Stacy says this can hurt a landlord bottom line and they shouldn't be forced to deal with it but he did have a suggestion for Denise\nFuel for this lady voted ... to ... to people in this quest\nNest quest we'd heard that name a lot during our reporting the bureaucracy affectionate is so bad Houston officials created an entirely new nonprofit last year to help deal with it and wanted to see if nests quest could really help people

Isabelle took this job not quest had a one point two million dollar grant to spend\nThe goal helps three hundred and fifty families with children moved to neighborhood with top rated schools\nI was extremely optimistic easy like I don't see anybody saying no to that and the first time we actually had a heart talking to landlords [noise] it was honestly it was really discouraging\nDoes affect the under mess quest landlords have very little financial risk and yet there's still so cautious of the ... does that suggest that there's there's still a lot of discrimination going on\nThat's exactly what that suggests and I hate to say that but it I mean it is a reality of what it is right now I'm ... they have this guarantee that everything will work like that everything's going to take get taken care of and it still\nThat hesitation that I don't want to work with someone who was on section eight\nA mid October only Seventeen families with vouchers are renting places and that costs
