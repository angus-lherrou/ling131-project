family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nIt's not so much what he did out the main reason he's still in jail is Louisiana's three strikes law it's called the habitual offender statue and usually you don't hear about it until someone's charged for some minor crime like stealing a flight of sodas\nAnd the district attorney or chief prosecutor Leon Kennedy arrow uses a lot to hammer them\nBernard noble has served four years I've been more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying

to work for ... as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson to how long were you were a da\nA well in regular here's a seven years and years of feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is zero right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office used the habitual offender statute back then\nI was going on and on point nine percent of the time I mean it was just there was a standard was as deep as low her job offers relied or a better way of describing either it was the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often or statute it was a policy that the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't figure in his early didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statute is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like the tennis arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's this mindset that the more before we lock up in the more time than we give people the more we're going to stop the crime problem on his father's from his ... you know harsh notices are the times\nOrleans public defender Danny ... says Kennedy ... office still uses the habitual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about\nIt's the first thing you're

from the moments\nOf your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge Orleans Parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it\nWhat is it all like All right this is like laugh because a lot of heavy but [laughter]\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nActually pose a problem with a function of a judge\nWhich is to fashion a sense is that some full is just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the ... statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone who has mental health issues or drug abuse issues I Want that treatments asks if they're going to be part of the sense of what the ... on the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes say twenty twenty five thousand a year if

[noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon can is arrow\nAre losing a shark on her show oh you do you're going to say oh well I'll be going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is arrows private Catholic highschool both are white men both have been da for a decade\nYou know for me I was with him as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything there's public safety can you serve certainly with no charm and jail or does public sector really demand Thomas ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Canada zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [laughter]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\n... I never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\nThe reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already ...\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean being do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is arrow always emphasizes this hoax his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor ... case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that surely not that's not my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nThat it is it is a law I think I have a responsibility to prosecute it get the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n\n\nFor Kennedy arose line is I'm just doing my job why does he do his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very\nSqueaky chair can explain why my name is Ken Israel's than I Am ...
