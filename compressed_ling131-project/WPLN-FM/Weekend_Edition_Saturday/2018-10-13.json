the storm\nAnd Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us Hi Scott what is the situation seem like today well\nAs you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico\nThere in Panama City there's no water no power and no gas most gas stations are still closed 'em and and as you head out of town to find the stations that do have gas there very long lines\nMany folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a small city about thirty seven thousand residents 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not a luxurious town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block

worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life is all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you know\nIt hurt reading the report [noise] because I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was the early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever that newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face [noise] I've\nTo answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do\nNo I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was\nClose with do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church building back in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise] instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils\nThat were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new areas and starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of all of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I

someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and all out of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside\nWorld your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with what I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around nine or ten she started to uh what me\nWhen I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those meetings just things started to give progressive way worse and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life\nFrom our town from her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June dirt from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that is as when I say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I\nThing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em and individually I started to start as a way of attempt in the high end symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something right\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating\nA meal once every three days and it was sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like I can just push my body and pushing my body pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police\nUs about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years and my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life oh man\nBody literally wrote from overused you wrote from not sleeping and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and it was hard to write about that it's harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWon't definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to eat right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood my mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse\nThe addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't\nReally honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes\nThat reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and try to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much
