leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just to Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book that is that the U.S has stepped away from the rural\nBut as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo I'd thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not\nHurt our economy and make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen and top two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news joined us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented\nYeah you're right in the article that to the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them or the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed a by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans maybe it's\nAll right on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to Islamist party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes a hired this company to kill this local political leader the LA\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservist he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nI guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nYou've seen how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not ...\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or us ally that really is against the law that is a little\n... this is a buzzfeed story not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight it's just an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this are there other countries will try it um are there other Americans other than the ones in or other Americans going to\nLeave you uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it [noise]\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working as Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons what is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the

Simon\nWe've learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face\nAn obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for Maddie but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... the high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\n... she was Thirty years of age her sister cater Neal Rosetta which worry and joined just know from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with thanks for having me first we're [noise] we're sorry thank you\nWhat can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was ... she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nA ... real answer to this book what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nYou're drug ... more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ...\nTo people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we're\nBe talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for Maddie on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course they'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and not spend a huge source of support and solidarity

weeks for the death of ... or the president calls it credible lodge and Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of this story the Saudis have now abandoned its intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual\nAnd that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while he was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this\nIs not the president's focus right now what is focused\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh the caravan law and order and common sense and a president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all

Washington Post arrived at the embassy that day to complete paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not criticized the Saudis and beer down gun Jay was with the president on the campaign swim out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my\nIt's a after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed the obvious to Mr showed jihad died a in their custody he at the at the embassy and placed on both the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight to the Saudis say resulted in ... what else to say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the showed used at the unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms in equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers off and on the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that your mouth shut J died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting a given given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up as the president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies he\nIs really trying to get the a C is hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle the confirmed justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd very down ... thanks very much for being with us thank you Scott [noise]\nWhile President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress of called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nTook the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least\nThe king and crown prince Pompeo told reporters on his return to the U.S the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nLong strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties have felt the need to do business with the Saudis but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly analysts Dan ... of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTruck has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this or transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibit it to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhat I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military and those are the biggest orders in the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom has pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like ... and looser motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy says Rachel process and author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both the U.S and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran but Bronson says Trump has embraced the kingdom more tightly whenever\nThe station has put all of their ... Baskin and they've been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont as the president said yesterday before the Saudis acknowledged ... death that makes it tough for Trump to crack down now\nThis has been great says why this is so\nSad but ... says Saudi Arabia was already backsliding on its pledges of modernization which is part of what made ... so critical\nWhat's your ... represented for many of us was disbelief in managed change in Saudi Arabia which is very slow he couldn't be patient he he expected to be patient about when he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with ... from on\nTrump says he will listen to congressional calls for sanctions against the Saudis and that he wants to work with lawmakers even as the president's stresses he wants to preserve those multi billion dollar arm sales Scott Horsley NPR News Washington\nThe state of depressed 'cause we've got a new ad campaign to encourage tourism or at least not disappoint those who do come to visit one ad shows that happy half dozen people voting downstream in an empty livestock pack that apparently I never ask a cruise ship with the headline lucky for you\nTourism director says their ad campaign had to strike a different note because not a lot of people say they think visiting Nebraska he says I called bunk on that\nBunk that's what people in Nebraska say instead of other four letter words he adds there's a lot of cool fun stuff to do here another at both festivals for everything from mud to testicles meeting a food festival where sheep and beef remnants or deep fried see cool fun stuff\nSupport for Nashville public radio comes from Tennessee State university now offering a twelve month executive m._b._a. program accommodating busy professionals with flexible scheduling of online and weekend courses learned more AT T and state dot edu slash MBA [noise]\n\n\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines believes in the Afghan capital of ... say there has been a suicide bombing ... say the bummer targeted a polling station as Afghans voted in today's parliamentary election the number of casualties is unclear\nProtesters are packing the streets of central London today calling for a second vote on whether to leave the European Union organizers say they expect today's demonstration to be the biggest of its kind\nAnd an unmanned spacecraft has begun a seven year journey to mercury it was successfully launched last night from Europe says space ports infringe on up the mission is a joint one between the European and Japanese space agency incentive successful\nOh I'm trial Snyder NPR News from Washington [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from visit St Petersburg Clearwater along Florida's Gulf Coast offering artistic draws including St Pete's Dali museum that shit who collection and to the museum of fine arts more at visit saint Pete Clearwater dot com\nFrom the Kennan Lucy lean and family who appreciate that for three decades NPR as help them to better understand a complex nation and world\nThrough its in depth coverage of events ideas and cultures and from Americans for the arts\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon I wait all week to say it's time for sports\n[noise]\nNot as having the game ... versus Dodgers after the ... group beat the sun's out of LA Dodgers last night seven to do we turn now to Howard Bryant of ESPN dot com\nAnd he has to be in the magazine Howard thanks so much for being with us in the morning Scott how are you doing I'm fine thanks blue man group Abreu\nCrew try on nickname for um how do you like I like that I kinda do they keep coming back all season don't they\nWell they do and this is nice revenge for last year I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we wanted up this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and it would be a weight exactly yes and a crusty taller debuted as assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring the head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when I ... I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive league the NBA he's been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having\nFemale referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast and so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that\nWe do here I Want to know gifts [laughter]\nYou know and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports and move the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one one that does happen it's um it's it's going to be good women's\nTennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's gonna be a rule change it Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rule change to go to the er what what what are they going to do it it's the ah highbrow break yeah after after\nUh tie break the way to the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fifth ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they can get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that imbalance who's the game\nTo the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour and that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under\nSo my advice to those guys just break\nServe a Howard thank you you're in San Francisco good they're commemorative fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists from the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of an HIV positive mother and shot that Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant and risk transferring HIV or but the child grows sugar and most likely die\nChild received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV\nThe surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa are about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet Etheridge is a medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of the team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing and the\nBaby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the ... happen now and to see this child alive and driving under these circumstances with this world famous case is obviously enormous the gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWell help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't hear\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV but the other thing\nWe had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for and live a diner for three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU and needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat are the parents tell you\n[noise] so the parents saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so they were sick need that wish from the parents and the mom taking any who was the diner that she could be a diner and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promote Senate Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much you make today to buy a request from this very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\nDoctor Etheridge do think this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to say you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nWe have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive passing and you're on your medication\nYou living in a normal life then that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive\nPeople can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case\nAnd it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nThat carried Etheridge medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you very much\n[noise] [noise]", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
