News San Pedro Sula Honduras [laughter]\nWell now going to take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting at getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from the precipice trained the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peace\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords there was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which all elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric there\nIs a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders oh we've had moments of turmoil I'm thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and have Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum has been in the news is you know um you have actually researched how language informs social discussions in perceptions\nAre in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people\n[noise] absolutely yeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors who the sociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans\nOverwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America it's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\n\nSupport for National Public radio comes from St Bernard academy and independent Catholic school located two blocks from the university now accepting applications for the twenty Nineteen twenty twenty school year more information on scheduling of school to her at St Bernard academy adult or\n\nI Know around with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday [noise] eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers the suspect reportedly had no criminal record but\nHad posted anti Semitic posts on line President Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he also condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the red Sox beat the Dodgers nine to sex and the fourth game of the world series last night Boston now leads the best of seven series three games to one game five is tonight in Los Angeles I'm nor rom NPR News in Washington\nMay [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from battle European made language learning program Bible teaches practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

that's according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\nNow one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy clue why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcasts report how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in their community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand with than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population that's not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years now ... agrees\nA few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toured the jail and saw that is\nVery very very very strict people because the boxing from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can out people were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand what is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic\nSnow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster

that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like sixty\nCoordination life safety what if they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leaders took the idea and ran with it now and the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center\nA lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representative from across local government and meet\nPeople in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump the technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group they come straight out of the ms emergency response flavor six term is completed they talk to your PowerPoint slides\nI think family virus kind of the numbers refer to items on there\nTo do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup catch and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction this to do list is over one hundred items long some of these\nI mean they're going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like he didn't an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier

dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured respected done and Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is your discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh that morning ...\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well\nWhat we know is that a lead and people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged up what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course at a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a ... as a religious service was expected to begin on he was armed with an assault style\nHand guns are engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder is a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood in the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYou have mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know how his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise throughout this committee in Pittsburgh a cope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n[laughter]\n\nYeah ... incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far [noise]\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American\nBecome more and more common place in American Life nonetheless the president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the synagogue the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage a ...\nFor three years at a Tennessee prison brie was released from a few dollars in her pocket that will determine to start a new lungs and reunite with her children Bree came straight to project return through her hard work and determination in your system to project return reevaluate employee of the company and their lives with her two sons home with their own\nLittle more a project return I and the daughter and\nThe Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime rate and and he you know he and\nThe vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a and and said that this has he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm a of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened\n[noise] well I think\nIt needs to two Asians and and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just to be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is there's a search for why after the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for crimes that they can prosecute and investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives that tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as\nA hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities and Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nI'm going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how oh we're actually starting this press conference now I'm willing to go there live here don't\nMost heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of the word Jewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as\nUh and just a\nWe're going to

shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate on Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrest\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town [noise]\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I

that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much junk you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity and politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by Nicole Anna Jones she covers race to the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters\nBut when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color or somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent whites me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why it but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nAbsolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journals are unable to actually call out the dog whistles so when ...\nUnderstand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago but white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist\nMeans we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is that most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then said when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] when I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very glaring clear", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
