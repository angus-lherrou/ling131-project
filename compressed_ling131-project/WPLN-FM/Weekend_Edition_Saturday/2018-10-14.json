Navarro\nThe terms of less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate House and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe just that's highly the silk can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and it's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they\nControlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen a good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what\nStates are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor of from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing and it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt um Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats a real chance to flip to them places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota\nI mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma both of those states had been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa to heal where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans and how many of their income and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win re election\nThey could flip it said in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank\nYou so much thank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue and debate and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants and their jails the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency Matt Katz from member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned into a political firestorm\nIt to\nThe issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nThe agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn using night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get\nDown here in a county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten sours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board a free holders as the county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken here's Anthony remodel\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this\nSo it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana of pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAs in Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without pushback\nYour job then they tax paying down\nOn balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences\nPro bono families and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to enable cities actually win their cases remain permanently in the United states or have released on bond\nVersus the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers are like in other parts of the country immigrants job and hoping ... for free legal representation\n... did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care that food several former detainees testified at the hearing last

... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most that they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten day to accept a twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says is a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when
