will hear more about that elsewhere in the shell but let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi I said the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrat to sort of a weapon I think the ...\nYou see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now Kavanaugh sitting Supreme Court justice where\nDoes this leave the country like a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt it ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to use an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women uh\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] it's close to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month

the Kavanaugh confirmation fight is however but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it will lightly it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time\nAs senator

seen some of them having all confirmation a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual

confirm drugs out today is a vote to end this brave dark chapter in the center for\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different reasons Republicans saw

Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight played out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bills\nBut while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAs a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the

sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post\nThe whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle for about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kevin ... and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a nonpartisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck\nIt up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court casting the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees just as Kevin other place\nCourts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look\nLike I'm closely contested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment\nFor the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so very much thank you my\nName's\nNicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can never know she writes about her search for her birth family and her career identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents first\nOf all I wouldn't have occurred to me just say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like

that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate\nAre aired on says he's saddened that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far we haven't seen any evidence to

that the show he did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon\nOr the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News
