Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nSince a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pleasure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many that issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the and king and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those numbers of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think and they've been very calculated in terms of how they released information\nReally to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis and I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and ... and others so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one ... and of course uh it really extracting I think an important apartment important price or from the studies which has yet to be determined definitely\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed\nMurder in this way quite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency the foreign exchange the native investment that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that may be in much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the Iowa was\nVery clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looked like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath and Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this was published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official Martian they're Mexican Government said that they are to me and if it at least\nThey didn't know anything about what was happening and they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species that we should start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official they're showing you sound like it's not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not nice about why the ... that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just these\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that back\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\nWell their students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than students decide to move that to both is where they were transferred dating insight to the CD\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the broadest to Mexico City so they went to was a station date\nAnd when their students were trying to escape ... be ... by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the boss just stuck them mhm they they're all ... of that back to bust his\n... from these two buses disappeared\nAll day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on this plus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling in spy boss is quite good why just to\nI Know so these two versus Wade ... to Boston is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from school to why why so what I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the bus secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students ... ... army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know this was that really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with ... in both on drugs locked I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and and west these ah informant and inside the cartels that explained made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording with my investigation that there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion any water\nSupport for Nashville public radio comes from Tennessee State university now offering a twelve months executive m._b._a. program accommodating busy professionals with flexible scheduling of online and weekend courses learn more and tea and state dot edu slash MBA\n\nUm trials Snyder with these headlines President Trump says he will be talking soon was Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman speaking last night after a campaign rally in Nevada\nTrump said he needs to learn more about the killing of Saudi journalist ...

I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up an outfit which is on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look not happy about that lots of lots of talk I as a real of a lot of young people on the ... especially people that couldn't vote and the fast referendum if they were too young\nAnd they were the ones saying that's what I being they think that being saddled with a math basically which is severely affecting bath each so a lot of that and really pushing for these people on any kind of ... that killed ... men on a grade\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um it is a vote possible\nSo ... ... if possible we could have they ... the prime minister ... and I said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to find a second if I get older legislation in place and he said at the ... ... to leave in March they probably if I was going to be some kind of people's votes it would have to then\nThat the day and not would have to be put back so the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries [noise]\nYeah it would have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much of\n\nA little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with\nBut if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump ... turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates\nDon't have the millions of dollars to run the tray somebody running for US Senate seat or us how she\nMight have so they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan and Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and then they are they're Rio and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra\nSpend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes and this is Jason will\nReverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm\nEverything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have chased a lot of uh uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear\nA lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty senses that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much that you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre\nPresident Nixon had up ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney general deputy attorney general

Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\nNixon was re elected in a landslide that November but in the early months of his new term there was trouble within his inner circle\nGood evening the biggest White House scandal in a century the Watergate scandal broke wide open today\nIn April or Nineteen Seventy three you

from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm new to Garcia Navarro\nHead of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz laughter Hispanic nickname his rival ... works his long used\nFor\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nPut your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized you said we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we come over you know during the day that we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them as they should be able to get our kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kinds of things but the one on the ground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the ... of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co often\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently during his mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that means I'm a terrible road because once you've created by racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and will through the ... century they're drawing people together or through or making them feel shirts\nIn our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now the label conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to government means that every time\nSomebody or one identity wins everybody now there are going to do things for themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that they're not election reserved and them whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to run the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real negative concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I think it is we're in I mean look the fact is in our country is is there were more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things are immigrants from the ... there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground but it's not available to us\nBecause the people who are ... digs think that every concession you know coming together but losing losing to the other side\nIn in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nThe other question is whether you could do that with our board your cold rattling weaponize dempster\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policy democracy it's crafting for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks

language in the kitchen yes you call it\n... the ... there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign
