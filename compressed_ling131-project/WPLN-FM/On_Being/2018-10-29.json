background of your childhood of your life your early life\nWell my early in life I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second\nWorld [laughter] and you have to be the war and um\n[noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood and um I think you know the Catholic children are\nPart of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the St right so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of change but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still have the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just knowing that imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives and the west so first I started a\nBusiness with my then husband John Bush and I was ... and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who worked there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business fat would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and what do\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really want to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words as you can appreciate [laughter]\nYeah so and lemon nations we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the the season and at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved\nTo wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that have recognized about what makes a person\nMore creative more able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\nAround right [noise] that is a chef that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nAnd ideals and practicality is yeah this story of searching satirist stuff\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't that right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nMaine who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the rich still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so man decided it was going to be\nBringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talked and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives\nSo I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and in a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny ... who also is in bug guy or with us back all those yeah right right\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand good lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question and he sang it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of ... in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right there but this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] yeah I mean this not as can be superficial and it can be abused it's like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really selling treats me in um in your work\nWeb streaming is made possible by him capital advisors formerly master ... classic management new name and location yet the same team of professionals providing financial planning at customize portfolio management to young and seasoned investors alike more at Nashville money manager dot com and people\nHas [noise] you know has is faring noble lineage um you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYay and William James hall [noise] um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to oh yeah this is David Sanger Daniel Kahneman cliffs Aaron our cat's name\n[noise] and also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and then something in your work ... through and seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm named mia Farrow and cs Lewis send the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really\nCrazy marriage so much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] then yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we interviewed eighty people and we ask them for\nWhat practices they were there's and that they were teaching or\n[noise] and um we gathered these\nLittle hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating we are opening our\n[laughter] teaching these students also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter]\nBut it it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out\nAbout three brass fan\nAnd I saw these arm's reach out\nFor their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their lungs in front of their face [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like\nThe little Catholic girl and ... what's the sec religious right [laughter]\nRight well but okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google as part of the problem here to the point that nothing is ... and um but you also written about and it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what'd you talk about that yeah that's really interesting\nYeah yeah um we devised that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response or initiating email and then you stop takes you read the brass follow your brass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then you read the email\nYou read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it it was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical me using and then one guy said I did something really radical\nPhone [laughter]\nRight [laughter] so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful I\nWanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really have to get off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah what what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd been notice what your anger is see it\nAnd recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see interesting ways to resolve it\nAnd to be able to act on it I communicated\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd they lost everything about that I wanted to ask you about that are so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah\nYou know it's ... lawyers worry that can they be as zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and they loved it oh yeah\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it as two to three seconds long [laughter] kind of interesting\nRight like physically like what we experience as a press about why that is too yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is a yeah thing meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also\nYeah it's it's the talk of the ... yeah [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um I've had many experiences across the years on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven I kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be out just transformative and now there is life and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that [noise]\nBut it's very hard to create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it it it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you worked with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nThe center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you\nKnow we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMindfulness sort of breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate it'd be into appreciate the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation\nOr that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that\nThere's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Nashville", "day": "29"}
