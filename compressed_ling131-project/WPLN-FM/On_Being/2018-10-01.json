[noise]\nI think that's you know the human condition and an irony of this moment we live and where pluralism is real and a lot of us are moving into it but some of the interests disagreements with those who are closer to us right\nWell there's always that way and the family I mean all all of this is all of this is based on you know ultimately and people say family is the basic unit of society and I would have some disagreements with that I think that the community is but you know these are all these are all reflections of dynamics between you know the same dynamic between a couple\nThere was nothing worse than your partner disagreeing with you in public you know if you have a partner and you and your ... and you believe something very deeply and your partner goes out and criticize as you in public or says something different I mean that is really devastating yeah\nMuch more devastating than somebody who you know you already know you don't have anything in common already had to hand combat disagrees who cares pass you know we're struggling within them in our movement\nAnd I I Want you to tell me about dialogue\nYou have been part of that are opening this up and that are very different from this either or pro con politicized abortion discussion that we're used to um stories would you want to tell people that have this conversation is unfolding well first of all I was\nVery lucky in that ah I met the people in the public conversations project\nIn the early nineties around a different conversation effort than the straight out abortion when I met them around a conversation that they organized that lasted for two years between feminists environmentalist\nAnd a population or the end the population establishment they line as hot Asian control [laughter]\nAnd um so I had the benefit of working with them in a group of thirty or forty people who met as I said over a two year period\nTo come to understand each other better and so that was my first formal experience at at dialogue and um and it was a very successful dialogue and people stuck with it and it actually made changes in terms of of how these three groups worked together at the policy level\nI then became involved with them\nWhen they turned their attention to the abortion issue most strongly they turned it at the time when I'm\nThere were the murders of abortion providers in Boston and I was in the mid nineties high midnight and one of the things they they I did with them [noise]\nWas um I asked if they would conduct a dialogue with me and one person who is pro life who I respected a great deal of professor at Fordham University who was a progressive Democrat and um we met with them for an entire day we\nTalked with each other for six hours in a facilitated discussion that was\nVideotaped or for posterity [laughter] um and in which there were like six facilitators engaged in working with the two of us one in the room and four or five\nBehind the two way mirror and so that was my first um and and it was a very profitable encounter what I think is very important is I'm not a big believer in common ground may be very Frank about that I think that common ground\nI mean the notion of common ground that that's the way we resolve are disadvantaged by lightning are humming grad okay yeah I just\nThink that it it's just you know I mean I think that common ground can be found between people who do not have\nOr being engaged in public life\nUm was a popularity contest [laughter] you know Christians are not call to be popular [laughter]\nAnd so you kinda you know so a lot of that stuff is in may in one way or another you know were called to speak\nThe truth which humility okay which humility because the truth we may not be right but we are called to say what we think\nAnd if it's popular one week very nice and if it isn't well that's that's the way it goes ... and so I think that you know there is some need to be for some people and some people on both sides of the abortion equation\nMore often than not people with either religious backgrounds are in the religious community have decided that they are willing to be unpopular\n... with their own community and I don't say that as any kind of martyred you know what I mean I'm I'm by no means a martyr and I you know it's like oh woe is me I have no sense of World War with me a great life um but but I think that you know you you can't be motivated completely by a desire\nTo have the choir singing your prices\n[laughter] I'm test something out I knew I didn't get this and I have it again these issues like they're they're so different in many ways to portion and gay marriage let's say those are the two lightning rod issue\nWhat binds them is if they are both about these intimate sexual aspects of life I'm ... [noise]\nAnd it it strikes me that um there are people\nOn all sides of these issues who are literally caught in them my the pregnant women and on the pro life side someone would say the innocence unborn child right\nRight um but you know you are someone you've become I don't know what somebody's called you the philosopher of the Alan widow Joyce movement and what if there's someone else called you the abortion queen All right [noise] right and the cardinal of choice I hired Arnold choice okay\nYou know but you again or someone who you've never married you don't have children of your own it's there's a and I I feel like in these issues these things are\nPainful and personal for so many people yes and that there's a role for you know what people I feel like you as a for bridge people\nWho aren't I'm personally caught in that trauma\nAnd yet can be a voice um yes I guess so and I think I think that that's if that's true then it's important to re set up to a point at it because that suggests a role for all kinds of people in our culture who\nMay not feel like they want to be issue space but do care about the fabric of our common life\nRight although I Would I Would just say that that\nI've never had children does not mean that I haven't been sexual uh-huh and so as a woman who was I'm now sixty seven years old so fertility is no longer question [laughter] um but you know for many years I was fertile and so the potential\nOf becoming pregnant\nI'm was in my life and I think that that it has a profound effect I mean probably a more profound effect on me that it might have had on a person who want your children and who had a vision of their own life\nAs a background in a more conventional a marriage family et cetera it was very important for me not to become pregnant ...\nMore important I think than for women like me I think it was really really critical and um I think that you know again I Want to go back although it's not quite the topic we're on to this whole question of the seriousness\nOf the power and responsibility that women have as life givers\n[noise] I'm\nI'm ... and this is on being today with Frances Kissling\n[noise]\n\nSo I'm going to ask you also you have been struggling with kidney disease now I have a right and I think that you knew the over the last few years after you have a donor I've been reading about your [laughter]\nDid that ... well my\nKid my kidneys have a have a continued my kids as I called them how [laughter]\nHow are your kids people ask me I um my kids have been behaving well and so I have not uh you know I have not yet how to even cross the threshold of you know getting a donor finally approved\nWhat occurred to me is I wondered how this experience has flowed into all the thinking you've done and all the passion you put all these years towards thinking about our bodies as once private and public yes\nAnd the concept of donation the concept I mean I'm fat it it really extended my consciousness around the notion that the the whole idea of the gift of life um and I have written a little bit about the relationship\nBetween someone giving a part of their body to me\nAnd that you know it's it's like oh this is so terrible um it's sort of like communion okay that part of someone else's body is going to be in to me\nFor the rest of my life\nAnd a foreign part that I Am going to have to work through drugs\nFor my body not to reject it these are very um interesting philosophical a reflections that I've made also for example when somebody gives a kidney um we applaud that person\nAs the most out truly stick\nOf human beings but women give their bodies every day\nTo a fetus to bring it into the world and every pregnancy carries with it the risk of gas\nWeb streaming is made possible by sites and harvest them a full service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at ... dot com world\nYou know I've always thought that if we were really talking about this theologically as opposed to politically yeah we would have to speak in terms of gifts rather than a rights I mean right exact concepts foreign to the Bible but gift but choice and life I I write if it's right [noise]\nUm what do you think you've learned and\nHow social change happens like ... what would progress look like now in these years had a few [noise] well I mean if you're on kidneys or with other people [laughter]\nWell I mean and that's very that's a very difficult question um [noise] what am I learned\nI I guess really\nI mean it's something I learned when I left Catholics for choice three years ago and I was lucky enough to get a fellowship to go to Harvard at the ... [noise] I learned a great deal\nThere about how\nWe learn and how we communicate with each other it was it was really a remarkable experience and that uh they need to approach others\nPositively and I'm within Suzie awesome for difference [laughter] um\nIs absolutely\nCritical to any change there is no way to change somebody I mean I you know like I'm the toughest are fighters let's let's be very clear I mean my reputation for being devastating I'm In debate is legendary\nBut ... ... and you know and I love a good fight but I and I love to win [laughter] but\nI think that what I have learned is that you know the the simplistic way of putting it is that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar mhm yeah that that's a very wise saying but I have learned that change really\nFirst of all I think change comes about at the margins of always believed that people in the center\nAre not going to be the big change makers you've got to put yourself at the margins and be willing to risk in order to make change but more importantly you have got to approach differences as I said with this notion that there is good in the other it that's it\nAnd then if we can figure out how to do that and if we keep thinking if both sides on the Bush if there isn't the crack in the middle where there are some people on both sides who ... absolutely refuse to see the other as evil mhm I'm this is going to continue\nWhat I think is really unfolding to others let's say to people that might be listening about where you just said is thinking about change on the margins as opposed to the margins where you are marginalized drive it's modeled his approach you're talking about it really does fly in the face of the logic and the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Nashville", "day": "01"}
