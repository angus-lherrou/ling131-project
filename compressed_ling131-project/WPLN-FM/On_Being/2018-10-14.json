S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the part is an oil in the gym onto the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally Khan who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them have been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the events\nWaited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nMm I'm pro stupid and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I uh moved through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nThe deep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stocks in terms of how we got to this place and um you know sell you a you know you\nYou mean you have to say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you don't know how you you grew up\nAs a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is more than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a lot to be a community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq some very deep you Steve humanizing latch yeah\nUm and I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean no one thinks they're mean and again\nIt goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these trials didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or cruel or unconscious um and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\n[noise] um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay what do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which I was like right it's waiting now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and we've forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel that way you were feeling and\nThe they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right in the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own has\n... and so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly so there's this ...\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel\nA dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurture and amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm\nSo I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't\nI don't care who does it worse I happened to have an opinion on the matter about ah I'm actually unemployed I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric is I I've come to think that ah that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity in general [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we could somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we\nAnd demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal friday say their game Trump supporters me that there are still bassist and they're so as long as they can I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out of\nIt and we blame the people for than expressing these used as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in\nPeople's intention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard\nTo assume I tried very hard to assume that you like me\nIn spite of some of the some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that in sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou you actually called that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's it you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics throughout this\nWhich is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so they didn't have been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot out there and kind of hear it but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes and I've had to talk to them that are all about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... asked Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nYou use the word so we made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and\n... it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since um but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way and\nThe common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing pointed this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like more of a record on those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\nI'm don't look I think it's very\nSuggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to have less and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first to feel like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that said that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that demands\nIt invites change in the country and in individuals\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I said something somewhere on the right to you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve we interpret the others are we going to reverse I and I get a lot these days\nWill that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this it absolutely is those who lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that\nYes hate is not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of hey yeah I don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments so the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican for so [laughter]\nBut are there are studies that you know look kids who go to\nRacially integrated elementary schools how grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after\nSchool programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then has a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually they've tried to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um\nAs we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we don't we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been in Europe both really good at saying\nYou know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and\n... yeah you said some of them not ...\nIt is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts swept becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off and seeing\nThe difference it makes in yourself him up for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nUm but it and then as well mhm ah people write back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like ah\nI\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories\nOf people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask for a long enough to ask it up and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all extraordinary\nAnd beautiful an equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nIt much I'm always struck um ... ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad in scripture the orders the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel\nAnd it's not the fall district but in the apple it's actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone that's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct\nRelationships in communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the\nReally push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people you know with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years\nUm and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line a and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee that we both began having these internal conversations with having kids\nThat level of local ... and I don't mean to keep working at a local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home\nAnd bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's a there's a great Christian author reserve Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot\nThat you know there is no better community in America\nThan the gay community where an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are blessed teams are blessed to be shared with me\n\nJesus ball hog\nLet me just it is\nUnder value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] and this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we\nCould finish one minute early what should police something deep in my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes that are I felt nowhere to attack\nAnd I don't know if this is a slam\nFrance with the two of you and in this room is very much in my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so\nFixated from Williams for really because there's\nMore to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some things that puzzles me am curious if with the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know",
