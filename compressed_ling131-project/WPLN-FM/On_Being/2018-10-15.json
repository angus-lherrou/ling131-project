S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two months of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally Khan who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation to two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before but I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with too\nAnd they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThere were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock different and goodwill humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our argument our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nMm\nI'm Christian ship it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as a guy a move through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm the deep\nWork that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we could no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum\nTaking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know Sally you uh you know you\nYou mean you have to say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah\nThat you tell a story that I found very you know and you know how you\nYou grew up as a community organizer and you know if you said that you know right wing or is\nMore than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked and not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell the story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nRight through the ... you know maybe she creatures who live under bridges in Iraq some very deep you humanizing latch yeah um\nAnd I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean no one thinks they're mean and again\nIt goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these crows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or are cooler unkind um and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because 'cause we are we're we're ... well the only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right\nNow but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and reads forgotten\nIt's or it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and\nThe minute they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why would you then do it right in a sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this ...\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel a demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurture and amplify it yeah yeah yeah\n[noise] um mhm\nSo I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't\nI don't care who does it worse I happened to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually unemployed I really think I'm curious do you agree with us Eric is I I've come to think that uh that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and ... [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to do both\nUm but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least\nHave a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal ... say their game Trump supporters me that there are so he's just in there so it's wonderful but can I hate them because they're so hateful I hate it out of high\nEnd we blame the people for then expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and assume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard to assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me in spite\nOf some of the fun in spite of some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou you actually call that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's if you know I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot out there and kind of your time there but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes and I've had to talk too much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed their saga yet but\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what a you know saying this has to do with repairing\nCivil discourse you know you usually only made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ...\nIt was just I didn't know anybody but a couple dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right\nActually our route several weeks ago about people in the right\nSuddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way and the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing pointed this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like work a record on those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious\nTo the people in our city block\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics when Washington is the be all end all everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\n\nTwo points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country grade but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is now I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first to like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that says that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of\nProgressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nThat ... may it invites change\nIn the country and an individual's and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in\n... when you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we've we've gotta we've got to improve we get them from the others are we going to reverse I and I get a lot these days\nWe'll that's unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this it absolutely is those who lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yes hate is not the answer to hate\nAnd he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and and you can't hate your way out of ... yeah\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprised I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress\nOn gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexican cartel [laughter]\nWhether there are studies that\nYou know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias\nAnd college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then\nHas a much more positive effect\nMore broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we I'm as we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact uh we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have then and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect\nThis you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric\nBook you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have men can still be on\nSocial media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of\nPeople being cruel on mine are off\n\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nUm but it and then as well mhm ah people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like ah\nI\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories\nOf people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things\nAnd who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that\nIn a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps\nIf you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and him and in some cases it's too much to ask for a long enough to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all\nExtraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nIt which I'm always struck um ... if it just riddles to some degree or what is the first bad in scripture the waters the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel\nAnd it's not the fall the circuit and the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone that's the first bad loneliness and show many of us concoct\nRelationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other\nMe and I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line\nA and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related ... that we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids\nThat level of local and I don't mean to keep working on local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer\nThat everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know\nUm there's a there's a great Christian ... Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse and she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that are ... are blessed to be sure with others\n\nJesus um\nLet me just it is\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise] I'm trying to fit ISIS on being today with Eric accent and Sally [noise] okay\nWe could finish one minute early which would please something deep in my radio bones but I'd really like to get can we just keep going for five more minutes that are I\nDon't know if this is a slam\nFrance with the two of you and in this room is very much in my mind as his so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated\nOn from ... for really because there's\nMore to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some puzzles me curious of what the two of you because you are in that world is that on so many of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around by the extremes which we allowed to define and frame of are important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Nashville", "day": "15"}
