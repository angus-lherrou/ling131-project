eight that the American Indian religious freedom act\nOn gave the Lakota and other tribes the right to perform their sacred rituals and ceremonies that these things had been decreed barber is more alive sing\nIn Eighteen eighty three and a law it occurs to me that you more or less grew up in the aftermath of that shift although probably when it was still in transition I'm just curious about that um is that so many are aware of\nOh yeah it's definitely something I've I've been aware of\nI I Can't speak for all of my generation and I cannot speak for all ... people have\n'em so I have luck with the family who is Christian uh-huh but certainly I for me it's like the more traditional teaching that are important to me as I said before\nBut even learning about those things it's something that has come slowly because you know you have to find the right people and yeah you're right family members and\nWho have that kind of knowledge you know to share a there's a great diversity even in our own communities in and I think that has a lot to do with the history of race yeah young real ... people had to pray somehow [laughter] right\nRight that that Christian um aspect of things is also

gosh that's so true but you know I was a little embarrassed just because they didn't\nWant to seem obsessed but um I think that that was important to me as well um is that\nIt's not it's not just not the past it's it's the president and the future I guess that is a world where trading exactly [noise]\nI'm ... and this is on being today with the poet lately long soldier [noise]\nYeah I feel like we're talking about something very specific but we're speaking in a moment of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to apologize for [laughter] I'm\nA you know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it ... it's not just the ... not only talking about history you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how when apologies are done well\nI have an interesting sitting there are scientists are studying to write but just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and how to start changing things in their brame\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has to be sincere I there's there's I contact and so you register at you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning of the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and Nicole her and the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from a sense of\n... [laughter] yeah\nIt's really important deliberation Nick this isn't just something we need to learn to do together\nOf your citizenship yeah there's the physical presence the energy that\nIs important but on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family member sit down next to me and apologize [laughter] I'm at a national level there's a lot more that goes with it right\nUm when I was writing this response or I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies\nOne of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada yeah a first nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding school the residential schools\nFor what happened there and taking them their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality\nThere is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pacing of that apology um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin\nBy honoring your treaties and doing what you said you would do yeah\nBut I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building right in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level [noise]\nHey what other things you point out is that um and this was President Obama signed the a ... that it was signed on a weekend it was not read aloud there was no ceremony and there were no tribal leaders invited to witness it\nI'm right and that ceremony is an important\nWay and\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah yeah right right right yeah I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nMm\nYears lately long soldier reading some lines from her book whereas [noise]\nNot desire in childhood to be a part of this but desired most of all to be a part of peace combined with others to make up a whole some but not\nIn ... it's OK apiece or part of anything\nLike the creek trickling behind my aunt's house where uncle bill ... bridge to cross from bank to bank not far from a grassy clearing with three key piece a place to gather\nI think of planes wins snow drifts ice and limbs the exposure and when I fly my arms into a wall coat and put my hand to the door not ready to breed the sub Zero Dark\nSomeone says be careful out there always consider the snow year friends\nThink badly of snow will bring you\nAnd ... remembering that for millennia we have cold ourselves welcome to meaning friend our ally its relationship\nSome but not all\nStill our piece to everything Mm Mm\nOh\nMm\n\n\n\nAfter a short break more with lately long soldier [noise] we're putting all kinds of great extra poetry music and a new feature living the questions into our\nPod cast feet get it all as soon as it's released when you subscribe to being on apple pod cast Google pod cast spot a fine\nOr wherever you like to listen\nTo support for being with just the tip it comes from the ...

something you take from but you do it respectfully right mhm and seeing the place of course to water and a source of life\n[noise] I Wonder um\nAnd you mentioned I'm a little while ago that you're that you do talk about your daughter a lot and interpret what tree and I know that you know and I like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you had to read and and maybe this will like you were to use about because I'm not a ... year not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but but a single voice of integrity and searching\nIs a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group in fact there is not um [noise] there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be like how to\nMhm I I don't want to read that just the like the\nOh okay see let me find it\nOK or maybe I'll read the first to the kind of yeah OK yeah\nWhereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be low quota there in the question what did I Know about being ...\nBlood rush my embarrassment what did I Know

that this is on a date with the poet lately long shelter\n\nA\n\n\nQuestion I'm always kind of pursuing an individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and um and I also know that that every one of our sense of that is constantly evolving across life but there are some things you said about riding high science are intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them is how writing forms you as a human being like you wrote some where um it's an endeavor I go into a now provides solid deep joy\nPerhaps is joy I'm writing a seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson extradited writing has shown me what happens with patients and someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to be human to the lack of using\nUm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought why wouldn't it be a writer one day\nI went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next\nAnd um it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward uh-huh that comes from that\n\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write but it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethic piece it's like six pages long yeah yeah yeah\nWould you just briefly say what what's happening and that he's\nIn dirty yeah\nJust briefly in thirty eight it's a\nWritten to\nAnd for the Dakotas thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight ... him and who are hung under the orders of a President Abraham Lincoln um as a result of this sue appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was\nWas getting smaller and smaller um and finally down to something like a ten mile tracked and people ... people do not have um hunting rights beyond that\nUh and basically um and they had no se a\nStore credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nAs large as a legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is race tree we don't know three or we don't teach 'em [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so they're stuck along the emerged her patients writing all of this\nAbsolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with peace uh-huh and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination\nIf something that I have to really respect like its\nOwn little person yeah [laughter] and so I Can't demand too much of it sometimes they have to\nLet it take a rest and then come back and being conversation with it again but it's a beautiful process that I've learned through writing oh yeah", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "07"}
