very secular working situations recently than I used to be because people really\nWant to look for it turns out [laughter] and I'm always the edges on sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it

she's just written a new book together with ROM DOS walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke anti that um Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life your early life\nWell my early in life\nI was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and it was right after the war I say the second world [laughter] All right and you have to be the war and um [noise]\nThere wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood and um I think you know the Catholic children are part of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the same right so there were a lot of really\nPretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of change but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nJust with gold seen insurance ... burg and a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still have the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just nice and imagine to write a [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so first\nI started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was an island nations and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in at a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who worked there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice you know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nIt's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter]\nSo I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the ... season and at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they have recognized about what makes a person\nMore creative more able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow from their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[noise] right [noise]\nThat is a chef that is still a still has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nAnd ideals and practicality is yeah this story of such and such ourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you\nYou had to find that language I mean isn't that right when you first just were offering a meditation course\n[noise] yeah [noise] uh actually\nMy friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was an engineer and number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so ... decided it was going to be\nBringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives\nSo I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course uh they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny ... who also was in bug guy or with us back all those you're right I\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand\nGoogle lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question and he's saying it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right wire but this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] yeah I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused it's like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know by something that really selling treats\nWork and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise]\nYou know has is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's something that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah in William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this young Ritchie David than Daniel Kahneman cliffs Erin ...\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and then there was something in your work they just ... through and seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis send the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really\nCritically him so much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] then yeah but\nBut it's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we are we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful in sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identified this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we Andrew you're eighty people and we ask them for\nWhat practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise]\nAnd um we gathered these\nAre alone hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating and we are opening our\n[laughter] teaching these students also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day but it's just it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know those sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach\nOut for their phones and brought lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little ... girl and ... what's the sec religious right [laughter] right\nWell but okay so and you did not all that beautiful workers Google and Google as part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very practical\nLike mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what'd you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google loves that she put her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes three depressed follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nYou read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective\nAnd then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it\nIt was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and we said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical knows me using and then one guy said I\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter] so you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really see I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd been notice what your anger is see it\nAnd recognize it as an energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges\nAnd they lost the training about that I Want to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah\nYou know it's ... lawyers worry that can they be as zealous advocate for their client at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that day judges are\nUnbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice\nAnd they loved it oh yeah\nI just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it in the past two to three seconds long [laughter]\nOf interesting great like physically like what we experience as a press about what it is too yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer right which is ... have said oh yeah absolutely\nNot be there [laughter] you can do it all over the ... yeah [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher nearby Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have some I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science\nAbout how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard to create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but\nYeah it it it's a hard time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you\nKnow we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um\nSomeone doing soupy chanting we've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um mindfulness of breads and walking meditation right\nAnd my vote listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate it'd be interpreted the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that\nOnce people begin to experience after they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that\nThere's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city":
