Powell certain facts don't fit it and it invites other facts to do [noise]\nI'm Krista ... and this is on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion or early ... [noise]\nYou in a strangers and they're on\nUm take up what you call it ... the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics any talk of the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and great pollution and great ... resistance to regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that which say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think right [noise] um partly I think the people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger batter\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government and its state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this patch it\nStrangers in their own land that I I just just just as an example of debts and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... state now it seems to come down on the little guy he\nKnows it's just take this by you if your motor boat leaks little gas into the water the warden All right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life here the state let's go\nHand right I Know that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are so rich and powerful that and say basically have a bond\n[laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say oh hey you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them ... ... ... I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was the last five years in Louisiana offered new companies yeah\nTo come in with that public money yeah came from Texas [laughter] um they then can make donations to the Audubon\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for LSU game still looking good and setting up third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy so the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state does your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also described [noise] this interesting\nDynamic that um that again is is new want rights not something that would be obvious anybody on I mean a lot of this is true but I mean for example you um you you have a chapter called there are members\nAnd there is something where you you a decision is amazing ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmentalists\nSo much complexity their\nHeart does mine yeah oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet and yet they're they're ... I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about ah environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused\nYeah you know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right\nKnow and you know it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it says the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you know I like California is very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environment result it's at that level to guilt it's not a personal one right so that show was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel accused [noise]\nYeah [noise] and scan like poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may ... ... ... it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking and\nLet's talk about reality in which we're thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is is bullying conversational anybody else you know new year coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think the people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that as Tea Party that's up all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we aren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubbles still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think there's a kind of a rich sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common ground\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ... we're putting all kinds of great extras and try to hide cast feed poetry music and the new feature lifting the question [noise]\nSee that's the misunderstand the ethics yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over and a hunting not at all\nNo mhm no not at all ... it just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed way of talking\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction wouldn't you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh identities pushing it too yeah she just counterproductive\nIt is counterproductive and sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any points that might be made I I Want to say you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of a larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and the lord or to do that\nYou have to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know making it it's a contribution to the larger whole to be really good about\nThat [noise]\nI'm Krista Tibetan dishes on being today with the steamed and sociologist of emotion Harley hawk shelled [noise]\nI'm not a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land and the timing\nYou've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right and one of the things you found which I think it's an interesting critique for you know the more the site that considers himself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh that regulation\nThat a lot of the things that are coming up people asked what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense than the government [noise]\nMhm mhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done phew that's you know maybe they will point\nUh lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed sub things didn't do okay let's figure that out let's have a right back for public conversation about just that [noise] it is the the government kind of\n[noise] in fact letting people down you know or are they expecting too much of it what's the record how oh let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent in extreme or ... I think maybe this was a ... interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met or five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise]\nUm so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on the argument say ... you know if if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on a liberal left and I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and Hemenway consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you heard was the central fact of your life you know [laughter] and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or ... people with different political\nViews I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left off at the blue collar class that lived there furious said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone wire or re paving roads were who were you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each here\nAnd uh I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\n... a little cocoon I've long been here as I Am kind of you know it's not only a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um and\nBut there's the kind of a reluctance to to reach out it's as if on the left\nThere's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruin like us I was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger and then there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nRight right with different colors yeah in in classes got together natural way they can be theory on each other they we're you know public school system is but we're down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year required of every one\nOf every one where a very yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach ... get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully to listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross um to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people are sent to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] this critique that\nThere are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they read this late right and yeah yes and especially now yet again and it's when white people\nThat that you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind\nIt's true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has\nHas been oh now they're called a diseases of despair and um [noise]\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was a criminal and I'm like yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse [noise]\nSo and so it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm\nSo I Want to drop your closest to spend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that", "year":
