certainly it for me it's like the more traditional teachings that are important to me as I said before\nBut even learning about those things it's something that has come slowly because you know you have to find the right people\nAnd yeah the right family members and who have that kind of knowledge yeah to share\nA there's a great diversity even in our own communities in and I think that has a

of time of\nIncredible fracture and there's a lot of apology type thing that hasn't happened and and we're actually building up a lot of things are going to have to apologize for [laughter] I'm a\nYou know it's one thing I find really interesting that you do in whereas as it and it's not just that you're not only talking about history you're you're also bringing in\nIntelligence from life about what an apology is and and how one apologies are done well\nI have an interesting sitting there are scientists are studying to write and I just what you just said I mean ... they can now watch someone gave a real apology and haven't received and have it start changing things in their brand\nOh really yeah I didn't but it has to be here but it has to be sincere I there's there's I contact and so you register that you register that anyway so you wrote in the beginning of the actually the beginning of your response whereas\nWhen offered an apology I watch each movement the shoulders high or folding tilt of the head both eyes down or straight through\nUm I listen for cracks and uncles are in the word choice what is it that I Want to feel and mind you I feel from the center of\n... [laughter] yeah\nIt's really important deliberation knew this isn't just something we need to learn to do together right as a ...\nYeah there's the physical presence the energy that\nIs important but on a national scale I mean it's also not just a personal apology so there's things that um are bigger than is bigger than having just let's say\nYou know a family members sit down next to me and apologize I'm at a national level there's a lot more that goes with it right\nUm when I was writing this response or I started researching a lot of other apologies around the world or a national apologies\nOne of the apologies that I was really interested in was the one in Canada yeah the first nations people the first nations right yeah I'm On the boarding schools do residential schools\nFor what happened there and the taking of their children and so on\nAnd that apology was read out loud it was like a verbal speech it was a transmitted through um their national television and it had a very different quality\nThere is a very different quality to the language\nAnd pasting of that apology um I always remember there was this one little a\nShort interview with a an elder elder native woman and I can't remember her tribe but in any case so they asked her if things had changed and she said in her opinion no things had really not really changed\nBut she said in just very very simple terms she said you know if you want things to change\nAll you have to do is begin by honoring your treaties huh and doing what you said you would do yeah but I think there has to be a as a kind of trust building\nRight in order for any any kind of apology to be effective whether it's inter personal or at a national level [noise]\nI mean what other things you pointed out is that um and this was President Obama signed this a ... that it was signed on weekends and it's not read aloud there was no ceremony and they were no tribal leaders invited to witness it\nI'm right and that ceremony is an important way\nAnd\nTribal culture to make something meaningful to signify that something has meaning\nMhm\nI think it's important in tribal culture but I think we have ceremonies all the time the White House yeah if they are moving out yeah right right right yeah I mean it seems like there's all kinds of ceremonies going on there at the White House [laughter] you know [laughter]\nUm Mm\nYears lately long soldier reading some lines from her book where as it did not\nIn childhood to be a part of this but desired most of all to be a part of peace combined with others to make up a whole some but not all of something\nOK apiece or part of anything\nLike the creek trickling behind my aunt's house where uncle ... bridge to cross from bank to bank not far from a grassy clearing with three key piece a place to gather\nI think of planes wind snow drifts ice and limbs the exposure and when I slide my arms into a wall coat and put my hand to the door not ready to breed the sub Zero Dark\nSomeone says be careful out there always consider the snow your friends\nThink badly of snow will bring you\nA ... remembering that for millennia we have ... meaning friend\nOr alley this relationship\nSome but not all\nStill our piece to everything\nMm Mm\n\nMm\n\n\n\nAfter a short break more with lately long soldier we're putting all kinds of great extra poetry music and a new feature living the questions ... ... feet\nGet it all as soon as it's released when you subscribe to being on apple pod cast Google pod cast Spotify or wherever you like to listen\nSupport for being with just the tip it comes from the ...

seeing it in that way I mean even just for example one of my friends posted something really funny on a Facebook\nThis morning I think and she was a reminding people when they're um ... what was I think red willow just as the season for getting ... and she was saying now everybody be careful and don't you know take more\nThan you need and leave the plant allow the plant to stay alive for the next um the next year rate so it\nIs always like even just things like that you know like little Facebook posts or what have you I mean it's still alive is awareness right I'm\nSam ... a sensibility huh of connection and\nYou don't see the red willow as a um a resource writer you are right something you just take from right it is something you take from but you do it respectfully right and the same place horse to water and the source of life [noise]\nI Wonder um you mentioned them a little while ago that you're that you do talk about your daughter a lot and in your poetry and I know that you know and I are like I talk among my children and my show um\nI I wondered if you had to read and and maybe this will like you were to use about because I'm not a ... year not speaking for you're just speaking for yourself right but that a single voice of integrity and searching\nIs a window in right to a world\nIn a way that often asking somebody to represent a group and factors not um [noise] there's this part in whereas there's the part that I can write the page whereas her birth signaled the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be like how to\nMhm I I don't want to read that just the like the\nBulls okay he let me find it\nOK or maybe I'll read the first to the kind of can yeah OK yeah\nWhereas her birth signal the responsibility as a mother to teach what it is to be Lakota there in the question what did I Know about being ...\nBlood rash my embarrassment what did I Know of our language like pieces would I teach her to be pieces until a friend comforted don't worry you and your daughter will learn together\nToday she stood sunlight on her shoulders lean in St to share a song in dinner her father's language\nTo sing she motions simultaneously with her

in Iraq or that\nTo the rise of other conversation\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nI said that this is on being today with the poet lately long filter\n\nOh\n\n\nThe question I'm always kind of pursuing [noise] and then each individual life\nIs its own way and to this question\nIs you know what what does it mean to be him and um I also know that that every one of our sensor that is constantly evolving cross life but there are some things you said about writing nice find so intriguing\nI feel like the way you've written about them as hell writing forms you as a human being like you wrote somewhere um it's an endeavor I go into a now provide solid deep joy\nPerhaps destruction writing seated comfortably in my court because of a life lesson that survived it writing has shown me what happens with patients and someplace else you wrote the surprises I've experienced in my writing practice have dislodged me from curiosity into love [laughter]\nI Wonder if you could say a little bit about those qualities and as a way into the question if what if\nYou're learning about what it means to be human through the life of using\nUm I think the writing practice um it was something that I had not expected to be a good fit I had never thought oh I wouldn't be a writer one day\nI went to the Institute of American indian arts and um they didn't have a music program that's what I wanted to study [laughter] but I really wanted to go to school there so I felt like the next best thing\nUm it was not easy a lot of uh I Would say the first three three and a half years I wrote some really really really bad bad bad poems like really dry it took me a long time\nBut I think it was that patients that is something I've learned through writing a sense of patients and their reward uh-huh that comes from that\n\nEven I'm just now thinking about the peace thirty eight but that piece for example took me\nI Want to say maybe a year and a half to two years to write what it was important to me it's kind of it's an ethics piece it's like six pages long yeah yeah yeah\nWould you just briefly say what what's happening and that he's\nIn dirty yeah\nJust briefly in thirty eight it's a\nWritten to\nAnd for the Dakota thirty eight who were I'm thirty eight ... men who were hiding under the orders of on President Abraham Lincoln um as a result of this sue appraising\nWhich came at a time when the court to people there um territory their land was\nWith getting smaller and smaller um and finally down to something like a ten mile tracked and people ... people do not have um hunting rights beyond that uh and basically um and they had no se a\nStore credit with the traders and so they were basically starving so there was an uprising\nAnd I'm as a result um these thirty eight men were hung and then ... ... people were moved west to South Dakota area in different um basically they lost their land\nThat it was ... legal mess execution in us history and yes and it happened the same week that President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation yes that is race tree we don't know three or we don't teach 'em yeah [noise]\nSo so you were just talking so this along this emerged to patients writing all of this\nAbsolutely I just think um that I've learned through writing the reward and the joy that comes out of just being really patient with a piece uh-huh and patient with yourself I think at least for me the imagination\nIs something that I have to really respect like its\nOwn little person yeah [laughter] and so we can't demand too much of it sometimes they have to let it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
