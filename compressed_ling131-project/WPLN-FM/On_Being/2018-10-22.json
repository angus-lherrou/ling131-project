[noise]\nYou in strangers on their own\nUm take up what you call it ... the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamics of the great paradox and um [noise]\nYou know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and rate pollution and great really resist Esther regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that which say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's the background I think you're right [noise] um partly I think people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was a bigger batter\nVersion of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government and its state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this pathogen in the book\nMan that I I just just just as an example of that and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... the state yeah we've seen to come down on the little guy he no it's just take this by you if your motor boat league's little gas into the water the warden All right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it\nAnd kill all the life here the state let's go\nDown that example hits home it may I can see that\nYes yes the big companies are so rich and powerful and that and say basically have a bond [laughter] the legislature and that there was that the companies have outsourced the moral dirty work to the state\nSo they say oh pay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our developed let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them ... ... ... I think it was one point six billion dollars that uh was in the last five years in Louisiana offered to companies yeah\nTo come in with that public money yeah which came from Texas [laughter] um ... can make donations to be caught him on\nSociety or for a new football uniforms for outlets you ... you know looking good and setting up the third grade classes in chemistry meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy though the state looks terrible the company it looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you could say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state is your enemy\n[noise] yeah and there's ... you also describe [noise] this interesting dynamic that um\nThat again is is new want rights not something that would be obvious to anybody I mean a lot of this is true but I mean for example you\nUm you you had this chapter\nCalled there are members and there's something where you you a decision made ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmentalists\nSo much complexity there\n[laughter] her heart does mine yes oh yeah yeah\nBecause the people I came to know are no more about the environment they know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet and yet they're they're ... I mean people working in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about on the environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused yeah\nYou know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right or is it\nYou know and it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you're right like California's very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environments result it's at that level the guilt it's not a personal one right so that show was very poignant and sweet I've heard\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel accuse\n[laughter] yeah [noise] and scan poignant this whole thing gets it as well and what you are shining a light on is the human complexity here and we may ... ... ... it does make things messy right but again I you know I just feel like you are for this is saying let's let's deal with reality\nNot wishful thinking and\nLet's talk about reality and not wishful thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is bullying conversation we anybody else you know you're coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground\nOn the environment and there can be I think\nThe people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea moved from the Tea Party that's up all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we weren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our ... still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think there's a kind of a rigid sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common ground\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAfter a short break more with our Lee ... we're putting all kinds of great extra an entire pod cast feet poetry music and a new feature\nLifting the question [noise] get it all as soon as this release when you described on being an apple pie cat Google type cast modify or wherever you like to listen\nSee that's the misunderstand the ethics yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over and having not at all no mhm no I don't know ... it just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed way of talking\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] ah identity personnel to yeah just counterproductive\nIt is counterproductive and sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nYou know any point right that might be made I I Want to see you know do you want to be right in every moment you know or do you want to be part of the larger healing [noise]\nThat's right that's right we all need to be makers if you want to make a social contribution help build a a public conversation about the big issues that day and in order to do that you\nHave to really be good at a emotion management [laughter] you know make a contribution to the larger whole to be really good about\nThat [noise] Mm [noise]\nI'm crushed attempt at an dishes on being today with the esteemed sociologist of emotion hardly hawk shield [noise]\nI'm not a poignant things I felt and throughout strangers in their own land and this time it\nYou've spent um [noise] in Louisiana is\nAnd it's a Bible belts right and one of the things you found which I think is an interesting critique for you know the more the side that considers himself to be an lightened is um [noise] uh that regulation\nThat a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense and that government\nMhm mhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done phew that's you know maybe they will point may be yeah it hasn't lived up to it\nThings didn't do okay let's figure that out let's have a right spectacle public conversation about just that [noise] it is the the government kind of\nUm [noise] in fact letting people down you know ah or they expecting too much of it what's the record so ah let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah [noise]\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent an extreme I mean I think maybe this was at another interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you met over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding children on the Internet reducing prison populations for a non violent offenders protecting against commercialization of the human gene I'm pushing for good jobs rebuilding our rail system roads and bridges and our social infrastructure [noise]\nUm so interesting to think about what if we started by saying a what we could start talking about tomorrow [noise]\nRight [laughter] wherever I'm hanging fruit right yeah mhm yeah that's right and do it in the in the spirit we've been talking about yeah mhm [noise]\nYou I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you're near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued say ... you know if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I was just it kind of humanizing and provocative and a human way consider as a possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that\nWe are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life\nYou know [laughter] and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no [noise]\nI think that there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two in people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nA at the blue collar class that live there Yuri upset I'd look we're the workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone ... or ... paving roads were who were you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\n... a little cocoon I've long been here as I Am and the kind of you know it's not only a contempt the really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um and that is buried to some degree but there's the kind of uh\nThis is on the left there's a lot of good political will but it's got curled up in\nOn ... and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us it was like them\nWhat we need our sturdy coalitions that and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger and there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors in classes got together and when you had a compulsory\nDraft drank right look different colors that in in classes got together natural way they're going to be theory on each other they we're you know public school systems um bought were down on those\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year required of every one\nOf every one where a very yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach ... get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross um to see if we can rebuild does\nThat connective tissue yeah\nI'm I'm sure people are said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um\n[noise] this critique that\nThere are all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they ran this late right in the new yeah yes and especially now yet again and it's when white people\nThat you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind it's true and I think it's a it's an important insight [noise]\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a diseases of despair and\nWhich is kind of a compassionate way crack epidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities which blacks ah wasn't it was criminalize behind like yeah yeah that's right yeah even worse [noise]\nSo and so it's a point is that should be broadly received mhm [noise]\nSo I Want to Joshua closer to spend just such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day":
