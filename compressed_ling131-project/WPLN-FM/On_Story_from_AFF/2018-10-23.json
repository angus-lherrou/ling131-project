I Want us they want the most movie star the movie stars and in this case they\nDonald on us or they go at that time were their their favorites and ah we kept on pushing back\nAnd saying I mean those are really handsome guys you know and they're big and you know you're not going to\nEmpathize with him and connect to him he's not every man and somebody had a ... mentioned any new should go see and seen oh man\nI'm this kid Sean ... he he just feels like he's right for it and David I went and we saw it and it was like yeah that's our Rudy I I well let's meet with them so we had lunch with Sean and Sean is Rudy he is\nEver present sees a bully and he's just he's a he's a little and the Energizer Bunny he's positive positive positive he was ... he was I mean they're part of what you cast\nIs not just acting ability but you cast a kitten a personality that you know as a better chance of messing with that personality and or the other thing that I Will say is because Shawn had never done the kind of acting\nThat I that we could actually tell whether he could go deep and play a level of of here's here's an important thing about Rudy Rudy to this journey\nWithout support so it was a lonely lonely journey and he was carrying a lot of pain he was carrying a lot of of disconnection alienation and sadness in order to make this journey and and I was questioning whether Sean could go there and boy he went there he really\nDoes have a you know he he he drew upon something that we we did this Iraq obviously\nI haven't seen this movie in a long time so I walked in here and I watched the last Fifteen minutes and uh it's not that I forgot\nBut what uh to me is is so important for this film important for every film\nAnd it was a key ... it's a key component who's yours and I'm In this movie in in our new movie too and and that was the film score\nAnd ah Jerry Goldsmith one of the giants and the business one of the great composers in the history of of cinema he's been nominated for Eighteen Academy Awards and we were very very lucky to get him for Hoosiers for which he was nominated for an Academy Award\nAnd um and uh we we we when we got the green light on this film\nWe we called him up and said we want you to our next from and he said no matter what it is I'll do it he was a beautiful man of loving man generous and spirit\nAnd kind and uh his very emotional guy you feel Jerry's heart and in the score and um he passed away about a five years ago and uh or maybe a little bit more\nAnd a ... one of the last\nThe interviews that he did a someone asked him a where when I ask him to name his favorite scores out of the hundred and Seventy or eighty did in his lifetime and among the top three was hurting or so and he would take this score he called it the Rudy sweet and he would tour of Europe\nAre in play this in in his concerts there was that special to him\nFor going to self bed [noise]\nFound go now I'll never be any good for you or for me or anybody [noise]\n\n\nWe continue our twenty five year look back with a conversation with screenwriter run nice honor in Nineteen Ninety\nWhich follows an attorney who was fired from his high powered law firm after it's revealed that he has HIV positive that film was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to acknowledge HIV and homosexuality\nTom Hanks won an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal of lawyer Andrew Beckett\nNice wonder is also known for adapting the W.

I really enjoy writing for television more than I Do developing screenplays on my own and it's really a golden age of television and uh it's that's a question anyone has which to aim for you know I Wish I'd actually started a\nFew years ago we they were building the sets as we were you know we we are writers room began three months or so before we started shooting which is luxurious networks show isn't like that that's six weeks [noise]\nSo we had an idea of of the arc of the season and has long ago had Bucky\nDent was the title of an episode and it was in her head and there was a um ... one of the brothers was going to shoot a priest and that's what she had that ... you know somebody and and re which is their ... but ... he would shoot and kill him\nAnd he basically said or re I killed the priest we're ... we're taking a tour of the the boxing club and does everybody knew what a bottle episode is so our show was going hideously over budget but also to and the bottle episode is an episode that you try to save money by having\nThat like laugh the episode where they get trapped in the elevator\n[laughter] you know Mad Men there was an episode where a Don Draper like works all night in the office and it's just him and Peggy and they get to know each other\nSo you know it's like so you didn't have to leave that you know so so are about we're ... we're taking a tour of the fight club the boxing gym which is a big part of the theories and my colleague and I uh Shaun we just we had this idea is that what if they don't kill the priest what they actually kidnapped the priest\nAnd we have our bottle episode they have the priest kidnapped year and they spend the episode deciding what to do with them so we can only ever let him go and that was that was actually one of the ideas when we got back to the office in ... to and\nShe just loved that idea so that idea went up right ... you know early on so our version of a bottle episode was that we went to our standing sets though we didn't just stick with that story because as Michael was pointing out we'd established several stories that had to be we had to touch base\nYou know we had to touch base with the other things going on and raise life raised in LA six or we had to touch base with his wife so how I how we outlined in an eye on the script decided when to go to those places you know you had to find\nIn that day in which these guys are trapped in a gym trying to decide the fate of this priest is also what's the biggest secret from their past as revealed ... you have to find those places where you can take an emotional break from that play\nThree that's really written like to play so that there's a moment of stasis so I created these moments where\nLike well okay we can't agree it's what to do the priest but you know what let's send a my gal friday Lena out there in the world to find out is anybody saw a kid you know my brother my stupid retarded brother kidnapped the priest\nBecause if there were witnesses than we have to call you know he's going to be in trouble and we have to we know we have to do we have to call the police\nYou know if there are no witnesses and that's a different story so we kept just trying to find these places where there was a break\nIn the story in detention where you'd be holding the tension and then the gal friday came back at one point but then we broke away we checked in with the other characters and then ... came back and said\nThere are no witnesses J. thing that happened that I can find and then re says oh great no witnesses so nobody can time my brother this ... this priest disappears my brother won't get in trouble you know and then that sets up the next election\nBecause this has been some terrible mistake you've got to recognize who [noise] St Josephine some books that I was I never served in both that I'm from Philly from Korea I don't know\nI don't know your brother my brother do I do I know he's my brother when they brought me had I have to call\nIt here [noise] hold on your hands do\n\nWhich one you break\nThe rape you ride [noise]\nMedical attention [laughter] everyone into trouble but of course they do get up to help us do anything\nSort of a larger question about the show and the characters in it like other shows that are on TV right now so Breaking Bad I'm even shows like a sprint as there are characters who are the main character but they are not often likeable or the you know there is also the melons and I wonder how do you\nBalance having a character do things that it's going to turn the audience off or make us and just like them at least temporarily because they're awful things and yet not turn the audience off altogether because as you mentioned with us\nYou're screwed well you know I'm\nThe first of all you have to know who your audience is you know and so in a Showtime or HBO cable show\nYou know Tony Sopranos the model of the ... the unlike ... hero I mean an end so cable audiences embrace that now there is nothing likeable hunting know what that word means likeable actually\nCause I find both Tony supper I like Tony I'm you know you kinda like wanna hang out with them now when he's killing somebody or torture somebody but you know like Tony I'll Wait a\nYou know what to do ... coffee after\nYeah comedy I kill the guy in a you know I'll be here [noise] um but the the unlike ability thing is is the villain the villain is the protagonist the unlike a bowl the anti hero is there a compelling reason for us to be engaged with that person that\nLike abilities you know ... not sympathetic I you know a character is not likeable to me am I engaged with that character\nYou know I keep referring to move because it has such an impact on me you know and blue Jasmine I mean if she likeable you know the cable as he likeable I mean she's a noxious pathological liar and a phony [noise] you know and yet I'm ... I was so engaged with her\nYou know it broke my heart at the end so it is about whether I'm engaged with that character is there something about that person that I can see myself in you know raise shut off from the world but yet he strives to be a good husband and father\nSo I certainly know what that's like I Know that's like to feel that I don't really belong in this world\nI'd had periods of my life where I felt that way profoundly and yet I strive to belong or as so that you know I Am I an insider him and mine outside of that is a universal question to universal struggle\nThat I think all human beings you know we always think that's a pretty cheerleader in high school like they were the worst they're the ones you know we're always like everyone\nYou know so it's always that way it's always the the difference between the outside in the inside the interior and the next year that I think that makes characters really compelling and that's why cable television is so much more compelling and network television because ... that's what the networks it's not about can you take\nOn ABC who cares if that network TV people are exactly what the person that there's no subtext now have secrets then have Secret Lives they're protecting it's like when we can't it's too complicated for network executives stand all\nOf that is really your most that's the most interesting place to write and I if those were you did my class you know write the characters don't tell me what the truth of your character is tell me what your character what confuses your character\nWhy is your character lost in life even if he or she doesn't know their last especially re Donovan goes through life fixing everybody's problems 'cause he knows what he's doing he is so lost and that's what makes him I think that's what made the show's success his soul is so\nDisturbed and broken and all he does this go through life fixing other people\nUm you mentioned earlier how you're working on the the AIDS epidemic sort of story and you're you're pointing out the timelines interim chronology of all those people's lives in ... and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Story from AFF", "city": "Nashville", "day": "23"}
