blockbusters does include the first two installments of the lethal weapon series\nNineteen Ninety One the last Boy Scout blocks directorial debut their romantic thriller kids kiss bang bang\nWas released in two thousand and five followed by Iron Man three and a nice time his latest film the predator read the franchise Thirty years later with an ensemble cast includes Jacob translates Olivia mind\nAnd sterling K brown I spoke with black following a special screening the predator at the paramount here head of the release of his latest film\nLets a predator and that's rather\nNow what are we going to do\nThat cabinet ministers very important to our scope of operations in this\nPart of the world arch the generals saying that a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed and we can't let that happen\nWe need the best while you're here [noise] go on\nSimple set of one day operation we pick up their tray with the CIA for running down grab those hostages and bounce back across the border before anybody knows we were there\nWhat do you mean we I'm going in with your Dutch\nThirty years is somehow that drive so Hawkins had didn't end well for you know\nNo ended massively um but I did get to see a lot because even the small mix in the movie that I was around was shot other sequenced so stretched to the entire shoot where did you know she was the first part was a part of the reactor and then we went to like get Mexico\nWhich was where the ruins are which is very fascinating\nAnd there is a lot of weird sort of jungle income Mayan type stuff to reprise itself in the predators series as they went along\nThe sort of a primitive tribalism\nWhich sort of outweighed some of the science fiction in in a way it was fun how did you even end up in this met me\nI was working with the Joel Silver producer on lethal weapon was Nineteen eighty six they had a script called hunter which they wanted to make and it was a ... about these guys who'd encounter nail it written by two surfers suspects script for all you\nAmbitious writers out there where their brothers yeah in German John Thomas is just shot out because it's one of those ideas in retrospect that seems pretty obvious and yet no one had sought to make this movie\nSo they came on board and there was a script and they said well let's try to spice it up and finally they went back to the original but along the way one of the people they approach to perhaps aid with this the script in terms of dialogue was me and I said no not really not that interested I frankly terrified at this point you know I'm just trying to stay afloat and write a new script\nThey said well why don't you come down to Mexico as a an actor in the film and uh you know we need some help with the writing you know at least be there and I said well you know that sounds like a fun vacation frankly\n\n\nOh\nThis is on the story from Austin film festival NPR I I started marking were packed with shame blast discussing the original predator and how it's managed to hold up even after Thirty years [noise]\n\nAnd the same way and stand by me when he's talking about his friend who and then he reveals narration that his friend got shot a liquor store hold up and you see the little boy who would become that man walking and then the distance\nYou just disappears it's just powerfully affecting I think\nWhen you first started a screenwriter what is their you wish you had known then that you did have that you learned along the way\nI look at it this will sound strange sort of the other way\nWhich is what if I'd forgotten\nThat I was so happy and excited about back then that I Need to re imagined and get back to their lessons you learned in other words very powerful lessons along the way about not being precious with every single word\nThe idea that rewriting is not sacrilegious sometime it's improvement or the tricks you used to sort of stay true to your vision\nAnd in the midst of people and the committee trying to separate out things different ways you know just because that's their job all of these valuable commodities\nPale when compared with the overall task for start a career to the finish of maintaining your enthusiasm and keeping your your sparks alive I used to be scared to write I Would think the last thing I wrote was the last I could ever right\nYou know I didn't know how I did it I was a loser I was a fraud we're all feel that way sometimes when I did learn was don't trust the people that think they are not a fraud don't trust the people that\nSay oh you know I was writing the script the well how did you get an idea oh there's lots of ID I just plucking idea you know there's tons look there's one now [laughter]\nI Wish I usually use today I've got ten scripts in mind um those are the people I don't trust because\nTheir facility and their ease with it shows that they may not be trying as hard if you're not wondering what you did wrong or how to make it better\nIf you're not a little bit tortured over it then I think there might be an issue at the same time I've learned not to be afraid of that torture afraid of trying because I used to be so scared I failed now I don't care if I fail as long as I'm Out there making\nIt until the barrier breaks and you find your way\nThere's a line in the rocky movie which I Will quote because it's a good line it's alone but it's a good line [laughter] and it's like visiting about how hard you couldn't hit it's about how hard she can get hit and keep moving forward [noise]\nTill they both English [noise]\nDid you see anything unusual\nLight in and then they [noise]\n\n... oh yeah [noise]\nGentleman someone something touring the peace [noise]\n\nI think they're attempting hybridization\nUpgrading on every plant they visit [noise]\nWe need to know if you pose a threat worse or some some ... kind of [noise]\nYou're listening to on story from Austin film festival NPR on on your house barber Morgan next\nWe're joined by a panel of writers who've worked on prequels sequels two or three quote screenwriters Bobby fairly actually Miller Amy talking to an end Shane Black\nDiscuss the challenges of life after the original as well as the difference between tying your hand at multiple installments within a theory or picking up where someone else left\nDumb and dumber writer Bobby fairly X Men first class writer Ashley Miller writer director shame black and the upcoming valley girl ... writer any talking ten discuss these challenges at the two thousand and sixteen Austin film festival in\nModerated by professor friends Dr clutches a nice guys courtesy of Warner Brothers aimed and misty mountains production El Al see clips of X Men first class courtesy of twenty Century Fox film corporation and do an entertainment three El Al ... lethal weapon to Kurt Warner brothers ...\nSo what I'd like to do to start off the panel is could we talk a little bit about terms in sequels prequels obviously those are easy to figure out remakes and re boots ... how how do we define the difference between them\nAnd when you're talking about a ... by definition there's been something before you so really you're a sequel you're just telling a story that happens take place trying to logically earlier or the new movie that everybody liked that you hope that you liked enough that they will still like you and your moody after they've seen it\nSometimes a brick wall can be a renewed but not always\nX Men first class was a pretty cool but also read it because noticed there was no Patrick Stewart no eating mckell and there was a shocking amount of hair on the head of a professor X their hair was huge hugely important to the studio for the ... ah they focus group that found out people like hair on their heroes\nSo it really all depends if filmed by film what it is that the studio is looking for because when you were into this really near the land sequel prequel\nRe boot remake you you were generally not making it too because somebody ran into the studio and said I have a great idea for another movie based on that thing that made you a billion dollars chances are excellent\nThey already want to make another movie based on that thing that made them up a billion dollars so it really comes down to what their intent what's there need where do they feel the franchise is and what sort of boost it needs to to keep it going\nWe had the opposite experience with valley girl and then a producer did go in and say to MGM and say hey you have the title in your library um why do we remake at um at the musical and that was his idea that sort of take the reason to do the remake so it can happen that way could you\nThis re boot remake prequels sequel environment what was that first project made or not\nI had made my independent feature I made some short term assignment I've written a few TV movies and I just I heard they were making remaking valley girl was a musical using all eighties songs as the song book and I was just like I have to have that job I pursue it my agents actually said no we can't send you end because they had other people end up to the job and\nMy manager went around any of the executives I have met with her before I kind of demand at a meeting and I went in and I got\nSo onward Bobby\nIn Nineteen Ninety four we made dumb and dumber did very well and they showed it on TBS in the anti like\nAlmost every other our for about ten years so [laughter] ... there were there was a whole generation of kids that new like all the lines in it and everything else so we thought hey those guys are still around we we should do arithmetic and are are sequel so it was about ten years later we went over to the studio and said\nWe'd love to do it you know as a sequel to this movie you know what it might not be a bad idea they said we said let's go see if we can get the two guys to ... you know to agree to or to without going to make it without Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels\nWe go to Jeff and he's like I Love it I'll do it just we go to Jim and he said I Love it I'll do it I got one catch he said I Can't possibly do it\nFor for a year but I'll do it that her we didn't have a script within them and it's going to take that long to get ready we go back to the studio is a good dose of the guys are in does catch Jim can't do it for a year\nVisit oh no no no no no we needed this summer\nIt was a that those are those are the dreaded words they're going to try to sell some little slot right and as I was it was about seven months away I or we don't have a script are we going to write a script make a movie in\nYears not that long to wait for Jim Carrey Mm no sorry we're going to you know we've got to go to a ... a ...\nWhy would you make a political why would you do it without Jim Carrey Jeff Daniels well we need\nTo fill a slot in the summer like oh no no no please don't do that please don't do that they did it uh\nThey offered us the you know be part of it and all that we said you know what her name right off\nI have nothing to do with anything that doesn't have those two guys in it we didn't write the script and we didn't direct but they went ... I never saw it never even saw and attacked and uh it was a bad idea and\nIt just it killed us because we really did want to make a sequel to eventually last year we did make a but it was Twenty years later and said it's how we ... we were thinking at the time those two guys maybe we could do a movie with them like roughly every ten years\n\nAh [noise]\nThis is John ... from Austin film festival NPR I sort of them were sleeping hearing for re boot screenwriters Shane Black Amy talking tend to be fairly and Ashley Miller who's kind of feature projects include the remake as they travel enrolled in China and this ... Miller just got the X Men first class\nAnd the importance of having different points of view within the marvel story to successfully reduce the franchise\nWith big trouble in little China which was to an extent a remake where we walked into the studio and said wow we really love to do that that help that we walk in with brain Johnson but we wanted to\nDo that project because there was something that we had to say about that movie is one of my favorite movies of all time and it's not about you know doing an Amash to a movie that somebody has already made it's about um there are things to be that there are things that the interest us their stories to be told and that's the thing that\nThat really drives us is there a story to be told and I and I think\nThat goes to writing a sequel to somebody else's material Shane is right it's you know you're ... you write a movie in the operating principle should be it is the most important thing that has ever happened to the person who's in your story so the challenge that presents you when you get to a sequel as well\nHow do you top the most important thing for us the answer has generally been point of view in an ensemble these like the X Men first X. men movie was road and ... moody X Men first class is a movie about Charles savior\nAnd ... those were different points of view we told a story that was about them\nThere was no no no no one would fare terms but things have changed\nStarted as a covert mission tomorrow mankind will know that even suggest show us they want to differentiate the fears that fear will turn to the hatred for civil can prevent show ... now he's doing so\nWould they do the same for us we have to be the best man we already where the next stage of human evolution you said if\nYou read any so naive to think that they won't battled their own extinction\nWhen we start talking about movies that are ... or ... even topped onto its how his point of view changed because of an event I'm from the first original film and more than that ah when we decide to do it who are we being responsible to\nWe feel a responsibility to our own relationship\nWith the original we loved it for a reason um that's our guy that thing that we can't violate and as long as we're being true to our relationship with that material we'd feel good about what's coming out generally it's successful\nLA is a very very small town so I'm curious what it's like to run into people who have rewritten work that you've done or having that awkward moment where you've rewritten other people's work\nI have that awkward moment on this stage a few years ago I was put on a panel valley girl again Marti Noxon did a rewrite of that and we were put on a panel together um and we hadn't met before that and she didn't realize she didn't even realize that that was going to be on the panel so that was interesting but actually fine\nHave you ever looked at someone's rewrite of your work and said damn they're better than I was\n... she brought so much to the draft and the draft is better because of her but they brought me back on to rewrite her draft but it's so great\nIs you're right that's what the writers community are really to be about it's the you shake someone's hand any of that it's like a drop the ball in the third act but you know what the joke was funny and\n... that line about the most important thing that ever happened is is is really good I\nHeard that before but occasionally there are stories that you can keep telling occasionally there are\nAnd one that comes to mind is the godfather right remember the godfather to that was that was as good as the original movie\nBut three for instance should they have made three godfather three today\n[laughter] [noise]\nThat's right up the dumb and dumber sequel that you just never looked at yeah so when you're dealing with iconic sacred cow material how much of your own voice can come through and\nThere is material that existed before you should have a relationship with it you should understand the audiences relationship with it you should understand what it is where it's been great and where it's gone wrong you know doing X Men first class\nPart of the exercise was what do we love about the movies what are we love about the comments where have the movie is gone wrong\nAnd then celebrating those things while expanding on them you have to create something that can sustain itself if you're just turning into something that isn't interesting and it's kind of a boring rehash of whatever\nI guarantee you'll get that note even if it gets developed through it terrify horrifying process back into something that is just a rehash of something that came before when you begin the process that's not what anybody wants they are hiring you for a point of view of voice\nWell the secret property of valley girl um [laughter] I think I'm the only person I mean I don't think the studio cares at all about the property I care about the original I feel a debt you or what that movie meant to me when I first saw it on cable and I was actually young to be watching it\nSo we did a remake of heartbreak kid right hands which is our intention was to uh take the you know based on ... and that the tone was it had nothing to do with the original just there was a little bit of the same story that's all I was at a guy\nGets married me he's not sure\nIf you marry the right girl and ... and on his honeymoon he meets a girl that's the right girl the writer on his honeymoon that was the ... that's about as much as we took from the original we'd ever wanted to call it the heartbreak kid we wanted to rename it and uh one of the names that we were going to a call I was a seven day edge\nAnd ah [laughter]\nBe a Farrelly brothers' movie and it was ... you know it was based on loosely based on the heartbreak kid and\nWell we\nDidn't get our way they they said they ... us like you can't use that title oh come on no one's going I mean that's a joke right they don't get to it so we went back okay we can't use that we've got to come up with a different time and we came up with a whole bunch of different titles that\nWe never could agree on one and the and the studio that we made the film with that or you're going to have called the heartbreak and we were pretty adamant that we don't want to do that you know why because it's a critical darling\nThey love that movie and it's so much unlike the original it was a little uh you know classic and it's out but we were just loosely taking that story where we weren't attending on not\nAcknowledging that story but we wanted to rename it and they wouldn't let us and uh that I was just a critics darling edited it really hurt us\nAll the comparisons were specific to that pretty much it seemed to say look what they did to this iconic classic sacred cow and all that when you guys were just trying to make a really good film\nI think the notion that reduces your opening yourself up too much criticism potentially cause you're rebuilding it you're changing it more than a sequel\nBut it's always where the weirdest one for me is the star trek J.J Abrams is it a sequel is the ... because in the first movie Leonard ... Spock appears in looks at actor or Chris Pine and says Jim just like you look when you were young he's like no no in your university looked like a different\nGuy [laughter] but he just and\nYou sort of go it's a ... and the sequel yeah it's a ... um but yeah just kind of that point about\nFans of a thing particularly a Amish thing feel a certain degree of ownership over the material and so it's threatening\nWhen somebody says we're going to remake that it's almost psychologically it's like and annihilation of the original or which has become part of their identity is like they they haven't quite been able to separate the existence of the original\nThe existence of another film and how do you protect your emotional connection to the materials\n[noise] look at some point you are moving on to a relationship with the material that you're creating and you happen to be true to match right\nIt's theirs in in the origin of the thing there is a creative impulse that that comes out of an emotional desire to\nEngage the material but once you're in the material and you were creating new material that's always going to be in the background what you're what you're asking about that's always going to be a part of it but it can't be the whole thing\nUm otherwise the material doesn't progress and it doesn't become anything interesting are now\nAre we experiencing a bubble right now with three makes ... boots equals because they do have a certain pedigree to them\nAbout those on top of that guy could produce a lot of really interesting television it's like a lot of the the storytellers that would have been making the original movies have moved into television\nOn TV the original content as original stories and it's hard to make a movie now just an old fashioned movie that was a a just an original story it's all sequels and all that or or big big tent pole movie is like they're really not making\nThe old movies that they used to make and they've all gravitated over to the TV side of things that I think it hurts the film side of things a lot", "show_name": "On Story from AFF", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "09"}
