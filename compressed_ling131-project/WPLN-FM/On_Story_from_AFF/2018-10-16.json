now you're focusing really on your narrative fiction so you're intersecting in that world all the time he talk a little bit about writing that line and and what you enjoy from both sides of it\nGenerally I considered myself I Do consider myself somebody who likes to work alone\nIt's part of why they carve out for myself doing documentary is I created a system in which I can make these movies almost entirely by myself\nI Would shoot them at that time I Would do everything and largely I Would do it the ... so it's interesting that I ended up doing a now three collaborations but I think it's also probably healthy when you bring up by so interesting is that it's been with filmmakers you know I've done\nTwo books with you and we'll go tomorrow and I'm doing this book where I'm George I'm Out\nAnd I felt what were they know what to make of that I think my books sort of have a cinematic field for them to some degree I think the the visual and they can do and and all the pieces which translate well too so I think I mean the funny thing is it isn't like I went out and courted either these filmmakers they sort of\nBoth of them and they're always sort of came to me so I think it was more like the filmmakers responding to my books rather than new responding to their films\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to on ... from Austin film festival NPR I\nWith the shape of water author Daniel crowd when we left off crowds was discussing his newest novel which is a posthumous collaboration was the legendary nine the living dead filmmaker George Romero\nThe living dead is scheduled to be released sometime next year [noise]\n\n\nOne of my favorite creature feature movies of all time was creature from the black lagoon he knew what attracted you to that story you know it's a it is a classic movie\nI think the shuttle Black Lagoon is attractive to anyone who has a developed or maybe over developed sense of empathy because the movie plays out like the creature is the bad yeah you're supposed to be rooting for these people who are hunting you basically\nBut if you cut any you know tenderness in your heart\nIs really difficult to watch that movie and not feel terrible for the teacher is doing virtually nothing wrong and needs cruel humans come down and they just let all asleep and Kuhn him and poison and I think as a kid that's a girl with the connection is that I\nHave sympathy for the creature and I know that's exactly what drove ... it's magical really that we you know can from Iowa and this kid from Mexico met up one day in Toronto and found out that they both had the same sort of obsession\nWith this creature for blacks would have been mistreated in the movie and sort of misunderstood in the popular imagination\nSo your imagination is was really carrying what happened to that creature onto the next ...\nIf you take the grades for about ... and they defeat him at the end and presumably drag him back to the United states well look this\nBeautiful creature who are hurting nobody maybe the last time is now in a lab to learn to us what happens till now is there some way we can narrative early right that wrong\nYou're listening to on stories from Austin film festivals NPR on I'm your host barber Morgan nowhere else was working on the shape of water novelty curator Toro was writing a screenplay for the film version was enough the camera or has\nAn extensive background in television having written for alias jak and Bobby and game of Thrones I spoke with Vanessa Taylor at our age season on story romantic a beautiful Keller U studios in Austin, Texas [noise]\n[noise]\nToday we are getting a new team an asset here in ...\nThis is talk to Robert hops that learn from our sister was built in Galveston now\nMatter of whether this may very well be the most sensitive\nAssets ever to be held to refer to it [noise]\nYou are not intending you were coming out of working at an investment bank which of course we know would prepare anyone for Hollywood right um so how did you go from that to this\nWell I had always been interested in writing but my impression was that writing with something you did as a hobby that it wasn't possible to make a living so my plan was to go to law school and right on the side and then\nI was in LA and I was about to go to law school and I realize a couple of things one was I felt like I was too old to go back to school and then I realized that you could get\nA job in television if you could get a writer's assistant job so I didn't have any real contacts per se\nUm but that's where my dad comes in he saw an article in the Austin statesman about Rob Thomas who had just done written his pilot for cupid and so I tracked Rob down and sent him a letter telling him how I had been such a great assistant and investment banking we had this great conversation and and so he hired\nMe which was just a phenomenal stroke of luck I'm In the show ended up going and so I ended up being his assistant on that\nI asked him as a birthday present if he would let me share a script with him and then after that year if he would hire me on staff as his next show 'em and he and his next show isn't that show was called snoop the short lived but illustrious knew\nEveryone quit that show I was like the last woman standing and they were actually trying to fire me so it was a wreath to see if I could if the show could get canceled before I got fired and I won so\nHow did that because it's an you know you're not planning on being a writer and all of a sudden you're on the show like keeping which was an incredibly unique show anyway at that time period could can you talk about like how that started you rolling and what that the direction of took un yeah I mean to have\nThe opportunity to write the script with Rob and then to get to know all the other writers on staff who of course all have agents I of course had had no idea prior to that\nHow I Would get an agent and so all of it meant sort of being an insider and suddenly having access to all that but certainly opens all those doors so it was it was a great opportunity can you talk about how the idea came about for Jack and Bobby I was working with Greg Berlin the on ever would and um that was a great experience we had some awesome writers on that\nGreg said to me I'm doing this project but I'm too busy\nWhat'd you want to be involved with it and Tommy I guess had been involved prior to that and a couple of writers had sold this pitch about the idea of doing something about a young president and then they were looking for some people who\nHad some more TV experience to kind of come in and develop it and that was a great experience you know we ran it together and I didn't actually to be a very challenging show to rate but I I really enjoyed\nDoing it so you you were involved in a lot of\nShows that had really more of a lighter tone and then game of Thrones comes back so we\nWould really love to hear how you got that call what that was like where they were they made the connection yeah it wasn't a natural fit\nNecessarily I'd read the pilot and just thought it was such beautiful writing David Benny often down why is it are just phenomenal writers and I was so impressed with it and I told my agent at the time and my manager and I just said\nOh I Love the pilot I think it's so great and it turned out that they were looking to hire someone they actually kind of wanted to write that whole show pretty much themselves and they have kept the writing staff very small it's only for people per year including them so we really got along and I think they're very confident writers and the fact\nThat I hadn't written genre before did not scare them and love the fact that they had so much confidence in all their people and they were\nCome back to us when it's done you know and you really have a lot of responsibility and a lot of autonomy it it was that was really cool and so you were talking about a little while ago that you're you're all centrally stuck in northern\nIreland together and it was in Northern Ireland primarily and then there were remote shoots and other locations but so I was there I guess my first season I was there for three months I think\nI think both years I was there three to four months\nAnd now you know it subsequently they've been there much much longer because the suits have become more intense more complicated but yeah so we were all just there in Belfast which is sort of like a tiny town you know it's sort of felt like being in sort of some small town and Wisconsin together\nUm and everybody would go out to the same bars and the same restaurants and I loved it it was just kind of a blast it was sort of summer camp the game of Thrones universe and especially when you're looking at it as you know for writers coming from writing staff that were obviously much larger did that teach you a whole 'nother scale says so David and Dan had not done television to my knowledge\nAnd they came into it and we're kind of trying to keep it as barebones as they could or writing room was very short a first year it was a month the second year it was a week because we outlined a lot before we got there but it made me think wow\nWe're all making this a lot more complicated than it has to be I just felt like they weren't doing a lot of things that were innocent shown I think there's a lot of wasted time and writers rooms and these guys were sort of like down to business like okay let's go let's do this thing we don't want to stay here for the rest of our lives the\nPart of what it taught me was like just get on with it and do it you don't need to make it so ridiculously hard or time consuming\nI think it's fascinating that they read hope springs that's what they looked at it and [laughter] and\nCare frogs [laughter] so\nI find people talk a lot about sort of the difference between genre writing and whatever else there is I guess regular writing or non John or writing but I've never seen that big a difference to me it just feels like OK in John ... there's more possibilities for the physical world\nBut all the emotional underpinnings of the world are still the same everybody else was surprised that they\nHired me off hope springs whereas I was like you kind of makes sense [laughter]\nYou're off game of Thrones and you um are looking for your next thing to do and you get a call from the guy who gave us held boy\nGear call kind of came out of nowhere I think he knew that I'd worked on game of Thrones and that\nShow as open so many doors because\n\n[noise]\n\nGod\n[noise]\nYou're listening to on stories from Austin film festival NPR eyes I'm your host barb from Oregon we're back\nWith the shape of water co writer Vanessa tailor the shape of water was the most nominated film it's a two thousand Eighteen Academy Awards and ended up winning far wars including best picture and best director when we left off Taylor was discussing the unique collaboration she had with\nOn the the love story part how are you going about developing that relationship thinking about beforehand how you were going to make this work for the audience\nYou know what's really interesting I actually remember part of restructuring things\nYou know there's a whole sequence where she's like playing music and bringing them eggs and doing all these things and I remember at one point I was sitting there restructuring like in the egg first me for the first like just because it didn't have words didn't mean it wasn't the development of a relationship they were having communication so\nI was just trying to show the emotional evolution of it in a way that I felt like it was escalating it all had to feel like it was going along and the way that it would if it had words\nBut I thought the friendships that she had were some of the really richest part of the film was that something they were always in the original piece that he gave you or did you have to fill out some of these characters to help in a silent character get further through this great\nI think there were certain moments where there was some conversation about like do we have enough for both of these people do should there only be one person would that be better but of course if you have\nA lead who can't speak you've got to have somebody there so there's no chance of not surrounding her with people\nWho knew this from the beginning but that these people would also and body this sort of other and that they were struggling with these issues of being very marginalized and that in a time in America when everybody thought it was Camelot these people still felt very left out in less than and excluded and\nThat was part of their friendship because of course she you know feels that way too\nI mean would you say that you basically we're looking at it as an adaptation and way off or something that he already had or\nSo it was a straight adaptation but I Would say that that love story came in so fully formed and so much of this visually was fully formed you know the imagery of the egg and and the water in her apartment and there was clearly ... had had this in his mind for a long time\nIt didn't touch at all I did touch the love story in the sense that I tried to think about what her are could be around having to contemplate may be saying goodbye to a love relationship and so I certainly had my hands in it but I really felt like some of this had just when I saw the cut for the first time I just thought\nOh he really really knew from a long time ago sort of what that would be you've clearly done\nThis before worked with a lot of characters are a lot of characters in that film that we have a lot of screen time so even though it's centered around these two un speaking creatures of how to know when you have too much when you're losing your main story like I Would imagine that was somewhat in divergent too\nAlthough with the merchant you know when you're adopting a super popular book you have almost no latitude at all you could try to kill off a character I think I did try to kill off a character and they were like\nSo you don't have as big a problem because even if it doesn't really work for a script they're like we don't care if\nIt's the same as the book is great um whereas with something like this you have to actually make it work and sort of unify these things and I do think we tried to do a little work there in terms of having ... so we have to do some work to integrate that make it feel like there was a reason for her to be there and it all made sense but you know it's a little bit of juggling that was sort of part of the fun of it\nI Want to go back to that non verbal communication between them because I didn't think it was really interesting how that got woven in there there's an awful lot about the creature that's left to our imagination and I'm assuming that was intended\nI think so and I also think there's a lot about her that's left to our imagination and the fact that she doesn't talk makes it much easier in my mind for her to be something of a fairy tale creature I always felt like if she were to talk we'd get into all these super weird questions but because she doesn't talk you kind of skate past\nThat a little bit and she's allowed to be mysterious in a way that I think really helps you at the end when you're feeling like oh this is a fairy tale well and so the voice over is that the first time you've ever worked in that realm\nThe irony here is that on ever would I was known as the voice over queen like a road all the voice overs I was totally into it and in this movie Everytime Guillermo put it in a voice over\nI cut it I was like no wars over don't need the boys over I don't know what even this is talking about like I don't get it I I don't understand why we need it and then when I saw the God it was really interesting because he had changed the voiceover slightly\nAnd so it did two things one of them I felt like the earlier voiceover didn't do and the other one I felt like I just didn't catch for the first one was established is that it's a fairy tale and the tone of the peace and the second one is it kind of tells you is this going to be beauty and the beast but it's going to be turned on its head a little bit and so I was really a little bit humbled by that like a cup\nIs so many times and ultimately I feel like it made the film better at the voice over there is a poem and\nFor all the time you're most sent me this war's over there was a different poem and then when I finally saw the ... he had this new poem that was the\nFact that he claimed he found it was like one day they were shooting in Toronto and he was early to that and they went to a bookstore and he found a book and opened it to the page of the world I mean it was such a crazy story and I was like okay I don't know\nIt was beautiful and I felt that it was so perfect for that moment\n[noise] hard to [noise]\n\nThe comes [noise]\nWas recorded on one\nHundred years ago [noise]\n'cause I'm I'm\nA person's real [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... there were I mean they could almost have had a movie of their own were they both originally in his in his throat was meant to be that specific kind of character I mean they were both clearly outsiders where\nThe sort of changes happened most in the script is Giles was always meant to have this um Henri quieted passion for this pie guy but there were many\nVersions of this ... I think in one version pie guy beats him up in another version the creature hurts Hi guy and there then there's like less Hi guy there's more pie guy\nI just think ... really wanted this thing about him but also about the future and the way in which they're thinking about the future and the future is green and he's getting phased out he's part of the past and they all sort of fit in for him the medically okay so\nWho wrote the cat seen\nWho wrote the caffeine so there were also I'm embarrassed to say many versions of the cats seem at one point I had\nGiles like giving her a kitten and then the creature eats the kittens and then there were lots of kittens 'cause we have this question of like how much does this creature have to do to threaten her feelings for him do you\nReally enjoy the process of working specifically with a director's you know when you wrote hope springs that was all your own right and then\nSo hope springs it's sort of a different animal because I knew really clearly in my mind what that was so I'd love to writing it by myself because I knew all the answers but I have\nSubsequently had something like that where I felt like I had such ownership of something and felt so inspired to write something and for a long time I tried to find something that would be similar and I just didn't find it that was when I finally thought okay I'll just see what ideas other people have and that\nReally opened me up to a lot of great new experiences so I Hope someday I'll have another idea that I really want to write by myself I Would love to do that it's just in the absence of that I'd like to work on things with the directors I respect\nAnd have sort of a collaboration and exchange of ideas and just try to keep getting better at it I find that I Am challenged every single time\nI've never met the screenplay that was easy to write people are always sort of thing like well you should just take this job it will be sort of easy money it's like this cheesy script about whatever the cheesy ones are just as hard as the other one it it doesn't work out the way the way they say\nEvery single time I feel like I make one mistake and I learned that one and then there's a new mistake to make an act\nBut over time I've become better at structure and I find real joy in knowing the answer is some of the time because then the beginning I remember very firmly knowing the answers none of the time and that was a drag", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Story from AFF", "city": "Nashville", "day": "16"}
