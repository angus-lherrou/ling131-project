TV season six for his party a killer you studios in Austin and two thousand sixteen clips from the jungle book copyright Disney enterprises incorporated [noise]\nI'm going to give you just a couple of quick details street fighter your first yeah let's talk about yeah I'm just a second produced here so I'm just wondering if maybe really obvious that how you got hired by Disney\nUm after street fighter I'm assuming is is it pretty coveted screenwriting job and\nYou know it's it's funny because this month actually marks ten years since I left my day job and was writing movies fulltime and street fighter with I think about the second job that I was paid for this so it came out in two thousand\nNine and you know it definitely put hair on my chest or in terms of going through the the ringer a and being humbled\nVery quickly but throughout that time like any\nScreenwriter you're a resume is not your IMDB page your resume is the list of assignments that you're being hired for usually two three four year most of which they never get made or sometimes you're working on a movie that does get may but your name is on it and\nYou're just sort of working quietly in that capacity so you're able to make a living and you're able to keep working and and one of the studios that I was off and working for was Walt Disney because uh around two thousand nine actually I work with them for a long time on a a\nAn adaptation of twenty thousand leagues under the sea\nBut it was called Captain Nemo and it was an origin story of that character sort of took place before the book and brought it up to the events of the book so I had a very good experience with the studio on that our producer Sean Bailey on that project is now the head of production the Disney and\nThe executive Brigham Taylor was the executive who came to me\nFour or five years later with an email on a Saturday morning saying what are you up to do you have anything going on right now there's an interesting project we're thinking about kicking around and bringing back and that was the jungle book\nAnd I said yes immediately I said what do I have to do and he said actually just come in and let's just start talking and I said so when do I have to come up with a pitch window I have to do that and bring them was very clear he just said no no no this is the job we're going to sit down together with Alan Horn who is the head of Disney and we're going to work out what the movie could be\nAnd that's how it started and I think you know at that time I had an office on the law didn't old animation right down the hall from where well Disney's officers used to be and as someone who just loves the history of that stuff I was dying over it but you know to just basically roll up your sleeves and a start to figure out what the story could be\n\n\nThis is on stories from Austin film festival and public radio international\nYour host barber Morgan this episode teachers to Modern Family adventure\nBut you have a sixteen Disney renewed of the jungle though in the Nineteen Ninety One of\nThe jungle book is based on the work of road you're going and inspired by the Nineteen sixty seven Disney animated feature film incorporates a live action star and young new comer\nAn all star cast jungle animated voices by the likes of Bill Murray scarlet Johanson Peter and young girls and Carlo as to Christopher Walken\nAnd all the book\nIs also the final appearances comedy great Garry Shandling and was released less than a minute after\nAnd our next segment screenwriter just in large describes a combination of CGI an artist rendering that resulted in the cells compelling characters\nThey did not do the thing that I think everyone expects where\nYou put those dots on the actors faces and you you put them in\nWhat they created instead which I think is actually a little more interesting is this artist extra Appalachian of that actors face because they had the videotapes of them recording their lines\nA great example there's a line I think it's a the way it was written was I Would appreciate it as a favor to me personally if you would stay a little longer and helped me get that honey something like that and the way he read it was\nNow personally I Would appreciate it as a personal favorite to me personally\nIf you you know and he just like keep slipping a word and I think he he did one more time to and it's just like finding that magic you know and then they can animate to that magic on top of it tell you what\nAre you know where the ... you can always go down to it whenever you want but I Would personally appreciate the personal favorites beepers if we just worked together just a\nAnd I think there would be interesting to see just how much honey we could accumulate before winter\nAnd I think that Christopher Walken the king Louis ... it looks like Christopher Walken in a giant a gigantic typical suit you know I don't know how to put it like it look his eyes everything and I would say the same with Bill Murray but those are just base entirely off what these incredible artist were able to do\nIt how is the process for years mining that book and why you know how did you go through it why did you decide to go back and do that\n... has an incredible language maybe it's a a function of the period in which he wrote and maybe it's a function of how good he was with the English language but he had this incredible way of\nCreating a sense of other in the way these animals would speak they don't speak like normal people uh and in the six or seven film a lot of those ... they're just speaking like guys from New York I mean a lot of that was an ... we talked about that in in this um to it there's a lot of good fellows in the current Jungle Book I'm not even getting the water\nThe sixty seven film it is in the jungle book and then it's an incredible story called how fear came a kind of a cane enable origin story for the general the first time or a tiger killed for support and not for meat\nWhich is considered a grapes and the scene all takes place around this rock that you know in a time of drought the river recedes in this rock appears and when this rock appears\nThat means the whole village is going to come together in this case the jungle is going to come together at a riverbank and just drink what little water is left and no one would hunt each other it was a troops that was called\n... have been many many years [noise] peace will reveal [noise]\nWas [noise]\nHunting The Revenge enough because my little of the jungle drinking ... eating so you could come to the peace ... on a day like this and find a fool people\nAnd we took that as like that the blackout in Queens\nIn you know the Nineteen sixties or Nineteen seventies and all the kids are running out and opening up fire hydrant and hanging out on the street and everyone's just sitting out on their steps together and it just feels like if you're a kid in that world looking around it's like this is the coolest neighborhood ever and in the case of Mobley it's like there's a crocodile and there's a a\nMongoose and and a snake getting a peacock and a porcupine and like all these things are out there to be seen and that was all from the kept playing\nJust walking on two legs\n[noise]\nThere were things that he would write that you just could never get out of your head the way Russia\nWho's not really in the sixth seventh them at all the mother wolf who Putin younger voices in this film she's the one who actually saves mobile his wife and the book\nAnd share Khan has come to get his killed to finishes killed this baby that got away when he killed his father or in Russia stands up for him in and she says in the line and the killing is so good as the cubs mine ... mine to me\nAnd I love again just the way mine to me it always stuck in our head and she says it twice in the movie once she says because his mind remind me to share content or the water truce when it comes to threaten Mobley and then uh when she says goodbye to him on that rock\nShift drawn to round for a few years and everyone gets along\nWell let me remind you of a man Cobb becomes man is\nHe knew about long rock show hunting for killing for ... you never knew him not to come into my mind to me so that when you came from you burn the [noise]\nKnow you you read that and you see that in as much as you want this to feel like a contemporary film\nHaving the animals use ... words made it feel to me at least more mythic a more like an epic film or something again a world that we've never seen before and it would it felt so wrong to ignore that ah so we really wanted to hold onto it\nSo early on in the process John said we have to assume the worst right now he said let's assume the visual effects can't get there let's assume that they cannot render faces in a way that we will relate to them or feel for them\nIf we're going to make that assumption then how do we make people feel for this movie we're going to have to play a lot of long shots and we're going to have to play a lot of close ups on Mobley space 'cause he's a humid and people could feel off of that\nAnd that affected the construction of the scenes and it's a great example is that scene where rocks that says goodbye to her son on on a council rock there she cannot at mote she cannot cry because wolves don't cry and we also wanted these animals to behave like animals they you know they're not going to shed tears like this and then\n[noise] get their little wolf handkerchief out [noise]\nUh you know they they wouldn't do it so everything had to be written off as its Mobley who's upset in that scene it's Mobley face we're looking at and she speaks softly and to the point and it's and then you see it and it's devastating and then the effect started to come in they showed this it's like a tough for second clip of the Guerra walking\nThe panther and he's walking like this and I said is I I honestly it was not a joke I said is that the reference and is like are you showing the reference of the panther and then you're going to show me how you guys are doing it and I know that that's fake that as the panther that is not a real panther and you know the daylight it looks so real and you see it the way they shoot it\nAnd when you see that and you see his face and you see his lips moving to Ben Kingsley voice you said oh\nThis is gonna work we're going to feel for these animals I'm actually glad we didn't know it was going to work at the early part of the process it created a limitation that are allowed us to have a discipline with the emotion but then you know when you have seen like that where you could just push it a little more with the reaction of the face it it works perfectly\nThings don't touch those on stories to impart my final draft industry standard screenwriting software that now includes extensive story planning to\nFind out more information about final draft Ken and final draft dot com\n\nBack just screenwriter Justin Mart where he discussed is the song and music and the Disney reduce the jungle book\n[noise]\nLittle so I'm just songs I was really surprised and I guess in a new movies coming out I just assumed because it was going to be kind of live action and animated\nThe sounds were gone and yet there is not\nSo can you talk a little bit about how that happened and the expectations of does need to have some of that music in there and uh you know I Will say that they just are so organically done they don't feel silly they don't even know this movie is so vastly different visually than the first film and\nMusical yeah well first of all from the Disney side I don't think there's any pressure or at any point to put anything into the story beyond what would help the story\nThat is not to say that there were people saying don't put anything in the movie but I definitely think the assumption that the very beginning was you can do it great but you know I we understand if if it's not going to be there and very early on uh with the bare necessities\nIt became clear that that was the rallying cry from Oakland blue you know blue kind of has a ... and the Montrose very much in line with the bare necessities so let's just give it to him into song he sings\nNews ... with a\n[noise]\nThis is on stories from Austin film festival and public radio international I'm your start from Oregon to the jungle book screenwriter Justin marched speaking with me at the ... story TV season sticks released party a killer you studios in Austin, Texas in April to thousands sixteen big\nQuestion I had at the end of the film was how much of Bill Murray within your script and how much a Bill Murray was Bill Murray\nYou know it was not in the script as my favorite line and the whole movie we've got this animal the penguin uh it's endangered in the jungles of India and in some visits with the zoo\nOr there was a conversation of like if we could have any animal in this movie from your point of view what should we put in the movie and they said please but the pain go and then because no one knows about this this poor endangered species and maybe it'll help to protect it a little more if people start to want penguins stuffed animals and start to become aware of them by Jones actually is the voice of that penguin\nAnd he appears in his little scene where\nThe Louis standing there at the bottom of the class and he's just begged Mobley to go up and get him some honey way up there and he does this whole line about you know if I don't eat my weight you know every day I'm going to die and I needed enough for hibernation which gets bears don't actually hibernate in the jungle it's cold weather climate the you know ... doesn't know that so he's\nYou know be asking him to the whole thing and he finally gets this kid to get up there and that's a little painful and walks and companies at all boy we got another one\nYou know but we've got another another monkey going up there to get him some hunting and then you know it's like you get the sense that there were hundreds of monkeys that it did not fair well for them but anyway so there's banter is happening and blues trying to encourage the kid and the pain go in and now I'm\nA squirrel shows up whose voice by Sam rainy and then a little pygmy hard shows up whose voice by John himself so they're all directors those voices\nAnd at one point blue finally just turns to the penguin and it's all Bill Murray and the way that he says he says you have never been a more endangered species until now I\nWould have done this myself but I'm afraid of heights oh boy here we go again would you mind your own business you know\nYou just going to run away not this one soon as the monkeys gets done they always run away he's not a monkey whether it be a man called America\nAnd could keep your boss down I'm trying to concentrate everything going up there [noise]\nOh boy looks like you've got another one was off it's amazing to have a man you have to have it's not a month you know if it's a man called you have never been a more endangered species that you are at this moment yards joy and amazing job\nCan't write that I like that you know I Can't bring that funny but you you know it's amazing because you do have to give the confines for a character I don't think you know John would be able to direct Bill Murray or Bill Murray would be able to engage with it unless he felt like oh I understand I'm kind of full of it and\nPlace but my stomach send the wrong place and that's kinda how I act okay that makes sense\nAnd they go up onto the cliff and cars blue takes them he says you wanna go to the men do fine I'll tell you the mental judging myself and you can make up your own mind and he takes them to the class and they look down into the valley and to me it's my favorite scene in the whole movie and and that feels like exactly as it was scripted where uh you know with little bill Murray is because that's where he has his personal\nThing but he says you know it's it's the scene where yes he's counting the kid into staying with him to get him to keep getting them honey\nBut he's also giving this speech about you know you just got to be you know that's your way and that's you know the thing you did I've never seen anyone do that before in my life getting me that honey like that you've got talent you know you've got I Believe as potential\nEverything that I Do not the ...\nWho cares the wolf way that's the ... the way\nThat the balloon boy that's our way\nThat's how we get things done I Can't even imagine what kind of a judge who they are if you had somebody like me helping you out\nAnd you realize like in spite of his uh subversion it's actually he's really sweet you know and he's exactly what Mobley needs at that point in the story like uh someone to put his arm around him to say you know you're okay you can actually just be you the\nWhole movie is everyone else's telling Mobley it'd be something he's not and blues the first person who says you can be ...\nAnd you know you have to strip that stuff I mean that's where the movie lives it's a very uh enhanced world it's a very vivid world the way John painted there's there's strokes of melancholy to it at times but there's also just this feeling of\nYou want it to go into that place and have a best friend who was a bear and another best friend who was a panther and you can hang out in the water together and just be there and no one was ever calling you home\nAnd this movie should feel like that it should feel like that kind of dream and so in that sense that's what that's what it is you know everything else just magically on top of it I think is just where the gravity comes from\nAustin film festivals on stories in part by final draft industry standards screen writing software that now includes extension story planning tools and find out more

fourteen year here in Austin, Texas\nI Know uh when you came up with the idea you came up with a with the help of your kids right I did not come up with this idea I stole it from my son Jake two is one of the lost boys he's one of reveals gang and the movie Jake asked the question at the dinner table dead to Peter Pan ever grow up and I had an apostrophe [noise] uh [noise]\nIt was a it was it was instantaneous that was that was a key everybody had wanted to do Peter Van that was a key\nWhat Peter Pan and grew up and that became the phrase for the advertising campaign ... actually wrote a screenplay for a silent film and then if you actually saw flash forward to Peter and windy being very bored and married in the future and I figured that's license for me to do that\nThe lost boys obviously we expanded I wrote a much darker hook\nMore about what James berry wanting hooked to be\nBut everything the ... references to some of the lines about the the the night lights watch my babes or the whole dialogue at the end but she says sometimes I see them so I see them so much in my mind that I think they're in bed we literally went through berry and\nIn the play James berry says in his notes to himself\nOh he is the great scene where he says today will be an offer to big adventure where Peter says it will be no Steven found in the play the last land and James berry wrote as a footnote was to live will be an awfully big adventure and so that line had never been spoken before in ...\nWhen you look at that that time and that kind of making all those set you saw nothing was there's no CGI there was nothing done like how the films are done now where everything is drawn later on and you're kind of Panama me to make believe new spaceship here or or this or that\nThat ship was there that those treat the never treat when they're you know you sit in the middle of the trunk of the ... between the four seasons all around it are there and so it was like working in a fairy tale I work at Disneyland it was it was super surreal every day\nSo the genesis one of your first movie so what was it like to see that that after you finished reading the script\nWell is really more about the kids the I didn't I mean the kids ... gave me back a career I Would never have written the script if I had not had children\nThe script went through a lots of permutations Steven when you when you go to receive and here's a million ideas a day and all of them are good they don't necessarily work with a million things that you that he was willing to try so that's represent a constant state of flux you you never type then on a trip like that I'll never forget the uh\nI went I was going to go home for Christmas and we just we had not sort of shooting\nAnd I rewrote the whole battle scene I'm based on some conversations United had and I was fried I Want to go home and he called me from what he called the rubble of Hanukkah\nAnd just told me that this is if you did it you know and there was a crocodile falling on him and even lines like tick tock tick tock shredded to cry you know those things were written a long time ago and they ... the fact that they still survive and they work as a very emotional for me to watch that film\nVery emotional and I'm just telling me what am I now I saw that um but that's that I think if Steven and had another six months without a out of release date\nWhere it could have gotten the script more settled I look at things and go well we could have made that better but the movie works the movie the movie works for the audience it's the\nIt's blows me away that it's become kind of perennial\nYeah not that's been a while since it's been a long lost in the in the film and I'm like sitting here ... years more detached from it then
