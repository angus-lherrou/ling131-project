foundation\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nHis own story from Austin film festival NPR I\nYour host barber Morgan this song story brain you'll look inside the twenty four in Austin film festival and conference happened from October twenty six to November second two thousand and Seventeen\nActor writer and director ... latest film Lady Bird was the opening night film at this year's festival labor and has earned high praise from credit for their performance of the cast and are girlie directorial effort I sat down with trying to grow and we can discuss mother daughter movies and her new found Lady Bird [noise]\nOf the things also that I'm really a phone call was there so few mother daughter movies and\nGoogle did that on the list of mother daughter movies come up or Rosemary's Baby an\nAliens and I thought wow are there really bad weather diverting now that is not a mother daughter and I know I don't know I thought that was very odd and I thought wow that's terrible this movie it ... the terms of endearment mhm and there was a ... says Hank and postcards from the edge they put it to me I tell you\nI mean those movies um I think the best mother daughter movie is actually the documentary by um the\nMeasles already garden yeah the dog I mean I've never seen that that is that relationship like just sort of circling the same topics again and again you're sort of having the same fights but in a new form and the way that they're kind of like mirror images of each other but also different like\nIt is a great mother daughter but the even though I mean it's all this other stuff is about mental illness and agoraphobia and lots of things and I'm\nAbout you know not living in the past and everything else but it is just beautiful complicated portrait as these two women and their relationship but I think so often you know mother daughter movies kind of fall\nInto something where the ... particularly the mother is either a monster or an angel and I think the reality is most mothers I Know\nAnd at this point is like my friends who are mothers it's a combination of like your heart is obviously you let them more than anything you step in front of a bus for them you but and also you're going to say the wrong thing and you can't help it and and that's just the reality of it and and and it's like in the same thing with like Lady Bird\nYou know sometimes she is so it's such a jerk and sometimes she's transcendent and totally empathetic with the world and\nI think so often particularly for female characters we don't like them to have many colors and we're not used to seeing it um so yeah it's totally it's completely under underrepresented now\nAnd well and I think you made an instant classic mother daughter movie\nYou know I have a daughter who also then and I just have to say I started walking\n[noise]\n\n\n\n... from Austin sounds that NPR I I knew how this barber Morgan this week on story brings to look inside the twenty fourth Austin film festival and contract which happen from October twenty six that were second in\nCommand and filmmaker Robert ... is best known for the films Hollywood Shuffle the meteor man and the five heartbeat cable ACE Award winning HBO series Robert counting partners in crime\nWas economy mainstay in the early Nineteen Ninety [noise] here's Robert Townsend describing his childhood comedy and find\nYou know when I was a kid um I grew up in a really rough neighborhood on the west side of Chicago\nAnd so when I was ten years old my mother was like you know she was nervous that I was going to get recruited by one of the gangs so there was like the disciples the executioner instead of just six device Lourdes all these games and so I Would run in the house and all I did was watch TV and so I watch so much t._v. that they nickname T. V. guide\nYou know that was my nickname it was like TV guy was on the night or seven o'clock I Love Lucy on not already mad at the ABC got a bit of a lot of the NBC you know I\nI watched everything on television and then there was a time that television went off I mean like in the olden days like now you know there was a time TV went off you this generation it's on all the time but when television went off if you missed the show you just missed the show there was no reruns there were no DVD there was no digital\nDownload so my mother we were on welfare and so you know my mother was looking for work and so she would miss her shows and so there she was like oh I missed the Hitchcock show what happened and I was like he said this mama\nThey filed a bomb in the added and discovered that ... out\n[laughter] and so [laughter] I discovered that I could do any character I saw on television so if it was the wizard of Oz and the movie came on I'd be the scarecrow\n... never gotten my brains have goals and you know what it's what what was going to the Bible to to\nThe westerners or Walter Britain what what what do you see you know [laughter] I watched everything on television even foreign French films it's just\nThat it has to do the best available\nBut I got discovered in fifth grade 'cause there was a white teacher they wanted kids in the hood to learn about Shakespeare and his name was James Reed and he wanted us in fifth grade to read like three pages of Shakespeare and so what happened was I didn't like reading Shakespeare look really hard to me so I went to the library and being a kid from the hood I stole all the Shakespeare records\n[laughter] you know so I went home and I listened to him\nOn our stereo or Richard the third King Lear oh cello and when it came time to read the teacher\nOf the street and he said we're going to read that allow and so he says Deborah Jenkins we're going to read edifice today Jeff devore Jake is you'll be failure Willie you're going to be at a piston Robert Towns and you're going to be to resist\nNormally would read in the hood up here [laughter] you will merit ... mother\n... father\nOr leave it up here\nAnd I had been listening to the royal Shakespeare Company so I read it like if I might not the right up all night [noise] and the whole class like crazy [noise]\nAnd so that's kinda how I started at the beginning\nOr one of my favorite scenes in Hollywood Shuffle is the barbershop scene because of things aren't going to the barber shop I mean just he just quit his job and uh his ah\nThere's so much in that scene is a little bit of meter man and that seems a little bit of five heartbeat in that scene a little bit for Saturn for your career in that scene where those ideas already swimming around your head\nI I I think it was really the beginning of what the possibilities could be because it takes a lot of courage to say action and cut so as we started on the journey and we would look at the dailies if it was like we can really do this we can really do this and so\nYou know but by just touching it you know it's it's like a waterfall starts with a single drop so we were just being at first a drop of like\nThis is we can make movies and it's not hard and we can figure it out and we were in the process of figuring it out so that you know the only thing that I Would say is that uh as you start to touch things you go like well I Want to do more of this and then you know it it starts to manifest\nAs is local tells him don't let anybody take away your dreams who who who who you're talking to who was who was talking to you right there\nWell you know [noise]\nIn life you got to be careful who you share your dreams with\nAnd my grandmother was the biggest hate or in my life like when I said you know no ... that's why she's a Hollywood Shuffle she goes you know like Martin yeah Helen Martin so in real life my grandmother was very negative you know I was like hey I Want to I Want to be an actor I Want to pursue she goes I what do you know about acting well you know about anything about show business\nUsually get a job at the post office it'd be a supervisor you know there's always work at the post office and so she was drilling at home and I would be at our table eating because my mind would be at work worked at the post office and you know my grandmother I'd be like you know and I stopped sharing my dreams\nWith her because I was like oh she's going to kill my dreams and and and it's kind of like as artists were were very vulnerable\nSo you got to be careful like you know I'm going to be working on and then if that person is like everybody in this room right now it's when you leave here who is the person that has access to your cell phone there goes when are you going to give up this dream of being a writer or director\nProducer you know your brother's a doctor your sister's a lawyer when are you going to give up and then you had those uncomfortable Thanksgiving uncomfortable holidays and I learned to share my dreams and so I I put us on a message in the film to say you know you know somebody that didn't live with their dream I I I don't have any regrets\nLike in my life you know like I I I've lived ... I Believe like ... I Lived on my dreams I'm continue to live my dreams\nI just you know now strive for new dreams but I think what happens a lot of times is that people get like my kids call them hate a frenemies when they're your friend but they're really your enemy so they can do stuff on you by not even like this is so you're in the screenplay competition you\nAnd that one little you will go like I'm insecure oh I don't know if I'm the right I don't know if I have what it takes oh my God oh my God I'm exposed I'm not good oh my God I'm like oh lord\nGet me outta here and you know we need the dreamers we need people we need people with vision people that are artists\nTo be born [noise] so you [noise] [noise]\nWell you know I Want to say about about about about Hollywood Shuffle\nThings about Hollywood Shuffle that I've got to say the film took me around the world took us around the world you know we were in Paris we read different places uh Germany Norway you know you know for little black boys to see the world and it's a little film takes you around the world but in France I had an experience\nThat changed my life because we had won the prize one of the prize at the dough ville film festival\nAnd I was leaving to go to my car\nAt the shots they lose a and so um they had a press conference and it was a room like this and they had all these French journalist and they had a guy in a turban and for me 'cause I don't speak French\nSo the interpreter you know like the second is the coolest boys because he was like everything you said it sounded like sex you know like I did a film on credit cards is this all to do to lose your dollar did\nThey let ... this is a little more about [noise] and\nI'm leaving the press conference to go to my car and I hear someone scream you know\nMistletoe has been misused then then I Will do talk to you about the state of the\nAnd I was like whoa whoa whoa\n[laughter]\nAnd it was a little journalists were glasses and he says uh I Am so confused by your movie in your feet um you said you don't want to play the pimp\n... but that is always be a black actor in the movies that come here and I was I\nAnd I wasn't mad at him I said but would you say that word and you say a little too well um\n[noise] he he was like he educated me that how how powerful images are the images travel around the world and there's a woman clutches her purse because she sees the color of my skin is because something that's been put into her bloodstream buy movies\nAnd so in that moment like when you look at that real you know I create positive images of people of color because of that moment because I go while I don't want my images to spread around the world is in the wrong message\nHas not just about representation for people's car watching but for all colors to watch yes of course\nYes and but but it was like it was because I you know like we're in France it doesn't really and I was like wow we are as filmmakers responsible for what we sent out to the world are so many levels\nMrs on story from Austin film festival NPR I I'm your house barber Morgan we bringing you look at the twenty fourth Austin film festival which happened from October twenty six through November second two thousand and Seventeen on this episode of on story\nWriter producer Gail and hurts film credits include aliens the Terminator and the walking dead to name a few here's galley unheard discussing her work with Roger Corman early in her career which led to her work with James Cameron\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] this is on stories from Austin film festival NPR eye on your husband barber Morgan lease on story bring you look inside the twenty fourth Austin film festival and conference which happened from October twenty six to November second two thousand and Seventeen\nActor filmmaker and all around entertainer to Keenan ... came to prominence in the early Nineteen Ninety eight at the creator of the hugely popular sketch comedy series in living color his show made him a household name both her original characters like French E N Detrow comic\nAnd for his many impressions including ... Williams Jesse Jackson little Richard and Mike Tyson to name just a few\nMan he directed the enormously popular scary movie which was written by his brother it's Sean in Marlin land\nWe're honored to award Keenan Iran's with the two thousand and Seventeen extraordinary contribution to TV award at the twenty fourth Austin film festival here he is discussing the past you creating his beloved series in living color the first question\nI have for you after re watching all of this recently was how the heck did you do this how did you get this on what was the perfect storm that got you on Fox at that point\nIt was actually a fairly long journey how it came about as I did a movie coming into soccer before the movie came out actually I screamed it\nFor all the um studios because I wanted to you know get my next film everyone came\nA but Fox said their TV people and so I got a call that Fox wants to take a meeting\nWhen I got there I realized there was a TV department and not the movie department and I was disappointed actually I was like guys you know I really don't want to do TV right now in back then\nThe big goal was to do movies TV was not as a\nPrestigious as is now so I was like you know I don't want to do that I'll do that at a later date but then they said look you know we're a startup network now we're not like these other guys we want you to do what you want to do\nBut I thought okay and I knew exactly what I wanted to do and I had all these friends who they were all the guys that no one knew what to do\nSometimes that works against you because you know there's a lot of what we see is sort of down the middle so you can't be too far this way or that way so like I said they they really didn't know what to do with him so\nSo we you know we went and shot the pilot and after we shot the pilot it sat for like a year because Fox was scared they literally will like we don't know what to do with this\nDo we had these meetings with people who I've only seen at that meeting and never again and I'm\nTelling you there is like a whole nother level to show business that we don't know anything about it was in\nCreative executives it was like they had done screenings and interviewed people afterwards and they weren't asking them what you saw was funny because they were asking them how did it make you feel like they were going that deep on it and\nThe final meeting I had was with the creative exactly Fox\nAnd then these guys in suits walked in\nDidn't say much just sort of sat there the creative executive started asking me questions about the show and my vision for the show and then uh somebody says so you know describe for us how you see the show and I said\nYou know I ... I think it's like revolutionary\nAnd want to do the students were excuse me\n... or what do you mean by revolution [laughter] and\nI was like no no not like you know take over the world revolutionary just like you know something new in comedy involved in any kind of sat back and after that meeting they decided they were gonna air the pot also on Larry Wilmore its been here a few times in one of the times he was he was talking about\nThe sort of games you all used to play with the answers [laughter] well you know say censorship is part of TV and we had the advantage over the sensors at that time because\nThere was a new language being spoken that they weren't familiar with so we were able to put stuff in that show that you should have gotten is taken off the air you know\nAnd I'm One of my favorites is um [laughter] and we would do this on purpose we would um put in something that made absolutely no sense right so uh we're going to go to la la land right something like that and then we would all laugh hysterically\nAnd a sensor would get nervous because he didn't know what that\nMeant so [noise] so he come up with no you can't say you can't say that and\nThen we go now or can we say cautious salad\n[laughter] and they go yeah you can say that [laughter]\n\n\nDo you play a lot of mind games right down there [laughter]\nYou know and that became my conversation with the censors was OK let's not talk about what can't be done let's talk about what can be done and then you know when we were we stopped playing tricks on them and we will literally get into dialogue\nAnd he got to the point where he would say no you can't say that but if you said such and such and then of course that wasn't funny so we're like okay well what if we said this and he was like oh okay yeah yeah so we had to negotiate that\nNineteen eighty seven action blockbuster predator lock the beginning of the ... franchise and it's still going pretty much directed by John McKiernan and start not one to two would be governors Arnold Schwarzenegger\nIs and our next guest writer director Shane Black incidentally Shane Black is it the how the latest up cutting in Selma the predator franchise slated for August of next year\nHere Shane Black discussing predator at a special screening of the sound at the historic paramount theatre in Austin, Texas during the twenty fourth Austin film festival [noise]\nThirty years and still hold that brain [laughter] [noise] so Hawkins\nThat didn't end well for you [noise] [noise] no no it ended massively or a briefly but I did get to see a lot because even the small bits in the movie that I was a around it was shot out the sequence so stretched it spans the entire shoot [noise]\nWhere did you all she was first part was a ... it's a Spanish for ... um [laughter]\nAnd then we went to like get Mexico which was where the ruins are which is very fascinating and there is a lot of a weird sort of jungle income Mayan type stuff to reprise that self and the predator secret series as they went along\nThe sort of a primitive tribalism which sort of outweighed some of the science fiction in in a way it was fun\nHow did you even end up in ... I was working with the Joel Silver on lethal weapon they had a script called hunter which they wanted to make and it was a about these guys who would encounter nailing written by two surfers suspects script for all you\nAmbitious writers out there just shot out because it's one of those ideas in retrospect that seems pretty obvious\nAnd yet no one has to make this movie so they came on board and they're just script and they said well let's try to ... male spice it up maybe wish and they did traps where\nIt was all about these guys going to cat houses together and joking it up and this and finally they went back to the original but along the way one of the people they approach to perhaps aid with this the script in terms of dialogue was me and I said\nI'm really not that interested I Do frankly terrified at this point you know I'm just trying to stay afloat and write a new script\nAs well why don't you come down to Mexico as a benefactor in the film and uh you know we need some help with the writing at least be there and I said well that sounds like a fun vacation frankly\nI I wrote some stuff for me and then there were announced dealt with it you know it's just a fun vacation a year later you thing you've ever your own dialogue I mean I I heard my dialogue elsewhere and incorporated and I didn't write the jokes\nHave to say this cast is pretty great I mean bill do belly landed on testing sunny poor Sunday I go on now\nAs as Kevin Peter Hall played the predator one thing I Want to stress\nThat you know I'm I'm probably in many ways although this is fun to show the film it's really the ... the product of Joel and John\nJohn you're hearing them yeah mixing and he's you know he was this young guy at the time with just as head of steam on drug may be up there playing with this camera you know just in his own world\nReally amazing to see people fortuitous Lee come together it's sort of first timers trying stuff that could have gone the other way and ended up being thirty year iconic in its longevity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Story from AFF", "city": "Nashville", "day": "30"}
