don't go of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that question\nThough because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause of Rochester right\nBut I found my way\nTo figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nOh about becoming American the experience [noise]\nBefore that I'd seen three people who ever looked\nAt like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes\nWhich talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life\nThey were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin\nIn Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American men who would be into death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese\nDuring the auto workers prices in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine people are now saying if this happened to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us\nAnd so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American\nI never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat your family what\nHave all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin of a cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met them because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes\nThat she didn't look like he had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask\nAbout a murder man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of the choice feeding her relatives are making\nChina set up the filmmakers of boyfriends and she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family of someone who spoke up\nTo be a bought again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find\nOut who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is\nSo I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer\nThe city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery ... grave we she drives us\nAnd we find ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on a tombstone and lowly ... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer

ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English\nI never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin and Nineteen\nEighty two was a Chinese American men who is being to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese\nDuring the auto workers crisis in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their jobs they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest once his funeral instead the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine people are now saying if this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us\nAnd so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family what\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin another cousin have I ever met him\nNo I haven't met him because I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two but I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me the Bush I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask about a murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends and she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears\nBecause at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin isn't feed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a ... again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know\nSo now I'm like I have to find out who will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where Vincent Chin lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus\nTo Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave we she drives us\nAnd we find ... name on a tombstone lowly chains name on a tombstone and little each and husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me I go\nThe next day to my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family\nSo we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters\nThe second sister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister ... is my mother's first
