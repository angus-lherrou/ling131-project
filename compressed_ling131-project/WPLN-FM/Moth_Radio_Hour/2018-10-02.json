Joe told the story at the color with civilian and boxer for an evening stories we called out on a limb [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm scanning my exam perfectly content and the knowledge that I think I've answered every question right but not sure I'm wanting to make absolutely positively sure it's correct\nAnd I look up and I think now I imagined it show about ready to get up in hand my chest and thinking I did very well on my Latin examination and all this\nHey Ken again\nAnd now I'm sort of focused on it and I knew it came from behind me so I quickly look I see a father vi has seen any of this going on and making sure that the coast is clear and when I'm sure that it's he hasn't noticed anything\nI look back and there's this kid behind me with this inquisitive look and then the quietest voices he says\nHey can watch the show now per se ...\nNow a little bit of background information here at this point in my life I'm a sophomore in high school and I'm a complete ... and you know I always do it I'm told I never get in trouble um most of the time people don't even know I exist and that's just the way I like it\nNow I don't know if this was a a a sign of things to calm or if it was who I truly am\nBut for some unknown reason maybe it was the look on his face of desperation\nI actually take my entire Latin examine handed to him\nYou should have seen the look on his face so he kind of looks at me and he was like All right and he writes all the answers down and I'm just sitting there with no test in front of me for one maybe two minutes which is an eternity when you're an inch river in a in a Jesuit high school with a with a mad priest looking at you right\nSo he Hans ... didn't get caught in the exam and he walks in a way he hands his and they were walking out of class and he comes running up and he's like a fake ...\nWhat's your name my name's Joe\nHey my name's lose that job falls to do what you did but I Want you to know something I'm a good student I study all the time I was a downed vacationing with my parents in Florida and our plane got to lay a but I really do study and I couldn't I didn't get a chance to have you had lunch yet\nAnd I have been the best of friends for the last twenty five years now being born in Boston and as a male in Boston you're indoctrinated into the sports culture everything Celtics Bruins I'm a Red Sox yes [noise]\nOkay so you know I'm a huge Red Sox fan and I think the reason why I'm a huge Red Sox fan is I have very fond memories of my dad\nAnd me going to games and my dad is all world Sicilian and he's arm's length and you know a three boys and the family he's never told anyone of us that he loves us\nSo ah but at games I always felt is love because we would interact we would talk about place we talked about players we talk about Fenway Park\nYou know he would pay twenty five cents for bleacher seats are back when he was a young boy and he would get all pissed off that this new guy called ... was trying to take over for Ted Williams that would really put some up [noise]\nSo um I you know as a Red Sox fan and a lifetime Red Sox fan you know there's there's a lot of ah there's a lot of pain associated with that [noise]\nAll right so let's go to two thousand and one my friend Lou has landed an incredible job is chief\nMarketing guru for the New England patriots now the New England patriots at the time\nAre also another tragic bad luck team bad ownership bad teams bad stadium the whole nine yards just awful and he's working for them or\nIn that role and they're building a new stadium in two thousand and one and they're trying to turn the whole franchise around with new ownership and whatnot\nSo I go and visit him and he says hey do you want to take a tour of the new stadium and I'm like sure so we put on the hard hats were jumping the golf cart and we drive out to the stadium and the ... they built the new stadium right next to the old one so we're right there so he ...\nGoing where and ... you know all these funky new age things that are going on and all of a sudden we hear this big crashing and banging and we look up in this whole bunch of staging is falling on top of us\nI dive out of the way he's not so lucky you write I jump up he's on the ground as blood everywhere well a big to buy for the huge six inch nails came down and it went right through his hand and into his neck\nSo I'm screaming construction workers are everywhere we call you you know the ambulance comes they take him to the hospital I follow the ambulance to the hospital and you know the the emergency room doctors take the nail out they say he's very lucky could have bled to death\nAn inch or two either way and he asked the emergency room doctors for the now\nAnd so you know a few weeks later after he's recovered were out with a bunch of friends who were joking around and I'm like why why did you ask for the now and he's like I just wanted to remember how lucky I was so we named her lucky ...\nAnd so we're hanging out and were were drinking and we go out all the time and he's like what if what should I Do with the now and we're trying to come up with some ideas so I'm like how about if you try and give some of that good luck that you have to the New England patriots why don't you go hide the nail in the stadium\nAnd he's like that's stupid enough that it might war that sounds like fun I'll go do it so he has access to the stadium he goes and he had the the now in the stadium\nAnd then two thousand and one the patriots the first four games go one and three and were you know he's like yeah the stupid now and then all of a sudden the patriots go on an unbelievable run and they win the Superbowl so we're like hey the downward joking around like two jerks right\nAnd so now two thousand and two rolls around and they're in the news that it's the first time in the new stadium and they're going to demolish the old stadium\nSo he goes and takes the nail out of the old stadium and they demolish it and he leaves the nail on his desk for the two thousand and two season the patriots don't even make the ... that don't even make the playoffs\nTwo thousand and three rolls around he's like you know what I'm going to put the nail in the new stadium see what happens and I'm like I think that's a great idea so two thousand and three of the patriots go to ensure the first four games then they go on this unbelievable historic run and they win\nThe Superbowl so we're like\nAre you kidding me and so he's like I'm leaving the now until something until they loan sisters unbelievable and so\nI give him this look because my brain is not working right and he knows and he looks at me he goes why and it's that I have an idea look and I'm like obviously the now his magic\n[noise]\nI said what if we put the nail in Fenway Park\n[noise] and he's like a gas he's like it's much faster than that\nIt's the talk enough courage job and I'm like I Know but we have an obligation as Bostonians Red Sox fans and as human beings to hide that now in Fenway Park\nWith my mother you know I didn't tell my dad about the money because I knew if I did he would say that it was his and um I just listened to her and I just I took to eight thousand dollars of cash in my back on on my bad outside on the street had never done that before and um\nAnd I deposited the money for her and I was too stupid to take a call it for myself\nA what I really should have and I would today if it happened again [noise] um\nAnd [noise]\nAnd um the the rule was awesome it was like I put a bed skirt on the bed and I had the left up pillows and it was like a class a motel room and there was like ten feet of space from the wall to the end of the bad it was like unprecedented gorgeous\nBedroom and the first thing my dad did when he came home and he saw that clean open space is that he\nUm he started to take out all the little piece of paper from his pocket and he went to the kitchen and he got his files he used to keep files and like run and boxes and he just put them in tiny piles all over the bedroom floor\nAnd at that moment my heart just thank you and I but I didn't say anything because\nI don't know why I didn't say anything and I kept cleaning and the next day I was cleaning the kitchen and I was throwing up like the three year old mayonnaise and I was you know throwing out like a Taco Bell south packets in all the takeout personality\nAnd I am the plastic bags that were like in piles of you know shopping bags in the corner and I remember the moment where I was scrubbing the floor I was on my hands and knees and my dad was at a higher level than me because he was seated at the kitchen table and we got into a fight because I was really upset about the bedroom and I said\nI'm I said I said dad I'm\nDoing this for you and doing all this cleaning for you and then the meanest coldest voice he said\nI didn't ask you to do that and\nYou know at that time I was too young and too angry to realize that there was really so much pain behind those words and so you know I just went back to college and I was like\nYou and I didn't think about him and I didn't\nCall him and he was all alone and everybody in his life had left him\nAnd I didn't care but um I've come to realize that your physical space is a reflection of your mental\nSpiritual and emotional state and no matter how much they tried to clean in that house it was always going to come back because there was so much tied to it it was like my parents beer there is\nWeb streaming is made possible by am

because I've been helping my girlfriend climbing through her window [noise]\nAnd so I got to get home and so I finished golfing up the car and I'm leaving this gas station I looked down the road it's

the banks of a ditch like a mole on her face and I got out\nHow am I going to explain this like if I crashed my father's car at fifty miles an hour I Would have been normal but crash your father's car at two miles an hour [noise]\nIt scared the hell out of me and it scared the hell to my father who demanded of explanation and I said I don't know I just didn't see the attorneys like how do you not
