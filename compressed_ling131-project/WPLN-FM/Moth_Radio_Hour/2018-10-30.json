in the war and it's not too difficult for them to tone and mosque night called high rent me stories from the front line [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I felt war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and to know books and pens and a few thousand dollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war the story of all to try to learn to be a war reporter\nAt war with all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not this point but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people die and more as civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war it was a girl was like sixteen Seventeen years old so I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces\nAre and\nThey took her up to a field above a child goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of ...\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to ... to die prepared myself to die or I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was\nA ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to freaked out I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then there's another couple of journalists and we were driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebels step by step out of the jungle\nIn front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb and I didn't have any\nGrand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see\nThe little black hole that the book comes out of you know one point a guy\n... gun ... started to shoot another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well\nAll these little black holes are staring at us and I thought there was a turning inside those holes\nAnd they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back\nI remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war\nAnd sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd it's\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um [noise] but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on that was leaning against\nThem sandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about bullets that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sound the bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives a moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the math on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nWere coming in hitting the ground hitting the sand\nParalyzed by some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it feels like bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing amateur soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then I'm fine\nI'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a lot braver than me um\nWhen he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know\nWar might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other on reserve easily without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together\nWe decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rich in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight they got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that same broke his leg\nHe's a ten thousand feet up on the scar with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it got down off the mountain\n\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment [noise] um and I'm not you know rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd in the film did really well and started it started with this scene\nThis is Ninety

waiting at casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you so you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was harrowing it's like a different body experience you're there and the spotlight is on you're not really aware of your limbs or the rest of your your body and the normal way that you would be\nWhen Josh Axelrod was on a new play left at casinos he was appearing on them off stage ongoing assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still had some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as has become increasingly aware of it\nUm but also because it's long been obvious to me that a card carrying reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] presents a piece of ID to a person in a casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personality is with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country they're often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id [noise]\nTo hear the rest of the interview and proponents material related to all the stories you can mock trading our go to the mosque dot org [noise]\n\n\n\nIn a moment we'll be back with this story about a young girls effort to keep her mom Walter south [noise]\n\n\nHim off the radio I was produced by Atlanta public media in Woods Hole Massachusetts and presented by PR rex\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThis is the moth radio hour from here I'm Sarah officers were asked this next story was told in Burlington, Vermont at a touring moss showy produced with ph international and Vermont Public\nRadio to see how I\nJamaica [noise] live [noise]\n\nWhat did I was hoping I Would have an accident and I wouldn't be able to come up here but uh\nTry as I said nothing worked uh [noise] but she didn't spell a hair I\n[laughter] I'm\nLike most people in the world I had a mother and ah\nShe had a sister and uh they were very uh\nOh on like each other and so they call road all the time [noise] ah my mother lived in ... and her sister where I was born and uh\nAnd grew up and uh her sister lived in Dominique her where she was born and where she grew up they call road uh\nBy letters they wrote to each other a letters that they would see up in an envelope and post a and the letters would be taken on a boat that would\nMake weekly stops in the island of the ... things and he would and we'd would island um\nAnd uh the letters\nA word that they send to each other was written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... law [noise]\nUh the lead to um [noise] uh I never knew\nWhat the court was about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English they then would respond to their latches verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly uh\nInteresting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I I'm adored her but mostly what I adored about tours that she adored me [noise]\n[noise] so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry in speaking in this language which I had no interest in learning at all\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language also we were told\n'em [noise]\nEven truly a well as I say I was very I I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother became pregnant I don't know how this happened [noise] um\n\nThis is the moth radio hour some PR acts and they're often Jeanette ... [noise]\nI next and final story told by Sebastian young\nBastion has been a war reporter for more than Twenty years but this this is first time on stage of ... ... in fact stories told on them off stage are most time and most important most defining stories from my personal life here Sebastian on crafting a story\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the law says\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply\nStory that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not too difficult for children told and mosques night called eye witness stories from the front line here [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I felt war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and to know books in pens\nAnd a few thousand dollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war to ... to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war is it does not this point but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example that the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nOf the people die wars are civilians\nIt was a girl was sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces\nAre and ...\nThey took her up to a field above a town called ... and ... they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot and the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human\nOr was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to duck to die\nPrepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was\nA goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then there's another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebels step by step out of the jungle\nIn front of us with their guns level at us\nAnd we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black\nHole that the bullet comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot like another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well all these little black holes are staring at us and I thought what does it attorney inside those holes\nAnd they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back\nI remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war\nAnd sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um [noise] but this day it was a really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning\nAgainst some sandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nWhen you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past your is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nBullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right what's the math on\nThat angle you don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking in that everything that was paralyzed by some sandbags or gear which have rights right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my camera to me it shows like bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing amateur soldiers 'cause the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I started shooting I start working and then a fine\nI'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave a lot braver than me um\nWhen he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot on this rich in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Phillies on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of heal up So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that sand broke his leg he's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain bike daughter were going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down off the mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment\nAnd um that's how we started to think of it are deployment [noise] um and er nothing you know the rest of his okay the worst was in the beginning actually and\nUh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n\nAnd it ... the film did really well and started it started with this scene", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Nashville", "day": "30"}
