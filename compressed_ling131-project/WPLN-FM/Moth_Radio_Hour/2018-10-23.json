into research I've been looking at that take send photos backdrop to a wedding dresses I was basically the reason interest with invented [laughter] and after all my deep dives I was ready to go it started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation\nAnd I'm now than an ambulance with vintage stamps I had picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp than I had to scour ... vintage WC Fields for a funny friends that\nI may have Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of Presley but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers they give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I didn't need my wedding okay I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's letting down\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with meat at thrift stores picking out all the Knicks snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little tappers for the twelve cakes are going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so\nWere things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle you compose didn't orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day it's going to be so beautiful\nThat's what I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty fourth which of my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung olive the twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made played bill I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri is tornado season\n[noise]\nI was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shape of swans when the tornado siren\nWent off and then came the rain\nAnd then hail and wins and it knocked all of the table Dover and all of my beautiful center pieces into the mud six months of making them every night and they were destroyed no one saw any of it\nNo luckily I was marrying the circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way up but [laughter] we had invited all of these ... people so we had trapeze artists and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so\nUp with the big shop and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in I'm already to begin\nRabbit was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't give them a little card I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise]\nI was looking forward to the song you know I hadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise] he's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy showed up and apparently brought a stomach virus but I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies\nAmongst all of this the worst part for me with my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there\nBy the stepfather that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\nBut he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nI'm is only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top [laughter] he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he should have been and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after the storm it finally passed by I mean it star friends singing a song from Britain to do and and also has to pay and jump around [noise]\n[laughter] and\nSo after all it wasn't the details that made the day I had thought it would be my custom made crossword puzzle police math and specialty cocktail I have made which is just jak and coke but [noise]\nIn fact it was our friends and the family that showed up for us\nAfter all the details don't make the day\nAnd they don't make the marriage either because I'm not married anymore and I don't think a perfectly sunny day and matching escort cards would have changed that\nWe shouldn't have gotten married there's some things even take can't fix maybe if I hadn't been so\nCaught up in all of the preparations I Would have realized that but there are no articles on interest on how to stay married and Martha Stewart doesn't really tell you what happens after the big day is over\nBut\nEven though it began with the storm it didn't end with one we were married increase corps which literally translates to broken heart and my dad says now [noise] [noise] well it looks like I didn't miss anything anyway\nBut he did\nHe missed a part of my life and he also missed our friend\nI'm a meat loaf cover artist called pot roast 'em\nWas also are videographer\nSinging karaoke in the garage well all of our friends danced in the pedals\nSo we missed a lot\nYou would think that with all this I Would sort of be sick of weddings I mean there are people who think they are a scam but I Love weddings I Love the details and stuff and became a wedding planner [laughter]\nI've married about twenty five couples and they've been no tornado that any of them they've all been beautiful had perfectly detailed days I've added more and more\nPins probably about six thousand now all of these ideas going through my head\nAnd so if I ever get married

N. W. here's Tristan reef lives in Mexico\nThe bright spring morning in the middle of the back woods of Oregon and I am volunteering to cut trail with my partner he's just ahead of me on the path and just suddenly I Know that it's time for me to ask the question that's been building up between us for months now have this\nDo you want to have a baby silence\nTurns around and I see that he is laughing at me this is the stupidest idea you've ever had [noise]\nNo I don't want to have a baby in his defense or we had our hands full we were actually already parents a one year into our relationship his sister couldn't take care of her kids\nUm well a little while became a long while became forever and our adoption of Haley and Riley had just become final they were ages five and seven and we were just starting to get that\nTaste of freedom that comes when you have big kids [noise]\nUh the second reason that he said no is because he knew that when I asked if we can have a baby I was asking if I could get pregnant and give birth to a baby [noise] uh this is in some kind of a feat of\nModern science or I'm just transgender uh for me that means that I was born female uh I was raised as a girl or the best way that I had when I was a teenager of explaining what was going on with me was I used to joke that I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nUm and as I got older um that's literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body a and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant\nThat um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy um which is what I did um [noise]\n\nUh I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay man in Portland [noise]\nUh and it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine which just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and best is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything's who have given birth to happy beautiful children we knew it was possible a but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows end unicorns ah and I just hoped that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nUh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know I Love everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the app you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse and he's a pregnancy test and then just made\nMe and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby and I'm so excited\nBut also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of the baby [noise]\nI'm Haley and why we have been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby and then my body started to change really quickly I'm an all of those ah markers of femininity you know everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being\nPregnant but it actually ended up being okay and I think it's\nI just had to like um except the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like best or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do or\nI could get excited about the things that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that and then I just about everything else go\nAhead and wait around this time we had a chance to tell her story publicly\nUm and I don't know about you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out of trans um because our lives our misery instead of the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes that there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and\nTrans people of color but for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience and family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready [noise] um and we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe just as good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know I'm\nIn the trans kids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store\nUm and just say thank you for helping them understand that there's a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams um a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man at all I'm just a really ugly Harry woman\nAnd that I was going to give birth to a monster\nAnd then one woman\nSent me a message that said as a Christian I Hope that you give birth to a dead baby [noise]\nBecause that maybe would be better off than a baby that has to be born to someone like you", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "23"}
