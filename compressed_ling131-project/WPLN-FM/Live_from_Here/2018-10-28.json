fellow Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic\nNew York on them as I rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town feel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bag New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone [noise]\nThe streets were colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker whereas a milk carton\nAs a hat [laughter] I have [noise]\nI walked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there's nothing crazier than in New York dog park these are not dogs that are used to the freedom of back yards and rolling hills these are had that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds I sat next to one of the\nDog owners and musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and the permanence ...\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed there's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who\nWere too strange to live in their hometowns but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park\nRocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nList as New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night's this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costumes or the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least one child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise] and they had a down McDougal\nStreet I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty smart [noise] his face paint smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they ... do they live in a magical lamb should I Try and return them into his hollowed out tree\n[laughter] I felt bad for him so I took his big white hand in mind\nAnd walking down the street have you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nAnd we saw a lot of people but no murders that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox were better view the postal department\nMight be slow they may not run their most officers that well but one thing they did right was\nDesigning their mailboxes they created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded hop you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on\nEspecially if you're drunk desperate and dressed like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side\nFrozen like a very ... [noise] I have never heard alive Kuala bearing couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs that broke my heart\nJust as I was about to help three others marks came running up and ... [laughter] as long lost brothers hug them and not into the ground in a pile of blue and white from I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away\nHave you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\nI have [noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train as a bank you we went to Joe is on ... street and sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window\nMost people just fight through the crowd and take their slice outside I was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy devil a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nDavid rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos hey have a\nHappy Halloween everybody and until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nTake the job [noise]\nBut I can also be Syria because now I'm In a business off as there are papers and a telephone on a desk in front of me says look if you enjoy paper or telephones that are plugged into a wall and [noise]\nYou were going to want to vote for me you know [noise]\nJust remember if you want things like change or change but also want everything just exactly the same I Am clearly the best choice to represent here [noise]\nSee now I have a hard hat on [noise] so let's get building some saying I'm candidate and and I approve this message paid for by darkening\nAfter\nA short intermission you are listening to live from here coming ... from the center for performing arts in Nebraska\n[noise]\nFrom years supported by C.
