returned to Denver, Colorado the Iraqis have gotten their first dusting of snow and stand like a road signs warning about the winter up ahead but down in Denver the weather was bright and Chris and the only worries people had was whether there was enough pumpkin spice to go around\nDenver as a happy town these days I always enjoy walking in Denver but now there's a palpable joy around every corner whether you partake or not it's hard not to smile at all the people buying legal marijuana and riding around on scooters [noise]\nThis city seems to have attracted like minded people from all around the country who agreed that life was better when they were ten\nI found a great coffee shop that struck the right balance of serving great coffee and chocolate scones without any added hint of ... arrogance I sat near the window and flip through outside magazine looking beautiful photos of mountain bikers and canyon vistas\nHave you ever had a double espresso is you scan through an adventure magazine and immediately thought you were ready to climb Mount Everest [noise] I\nA woman named Kelly ... sat down next to me she had long gray hair smartly dressed in war just one piece of turquoise jewelry as if to say I live in the west but let's not get carried away [noise]\nShe moved here from New Jersey and loves Colorado but it's been having a hard time finding someone to date she's more of a city girl but every guy in Denver has the same exact dating profile they like to hike bike running ski she said I don't want a guy does any of that\nDating is exhausting enough without having to work on my cardio [noise]\nI'm not looking to get married I'm sixty years old I just want to have someone to have fun with someone who enjoys life the way it's meant to be enjoyed and who doesn't pass out at the site of a croissant\nThe good thing about being my age is that I Know who they are the minute I see them like that guy she pointed to a gentleman who looked like an angry months old Jack o lantern he's too much work that guy if you haven't learned how to handle what life gives you that the face you get\nAnother guy walks by the window where the tweed jacket and a little cap and mustache now he's got potential\nBe an athlete\nThat's what I Want a man who always knows where slippers are [noise]\nShe gathered are phoning keys and stood up oh well it's time for the pumpkin trunk and festivals you should come have you ever been to the pumpkin chunk and you'll love it have you ever drink so much coffee and eat in so many chocolate scones that you agreed to join a total stranger to a pumpkin festival you knew nothing about\nI have\nIt turns out that the pumpkin chunk and festivals and autumn event where they launch pumpkins in the air by these the slingshots cannons and catapult that stance three stories high it sounded like yet another reason why adults shouldn't get so involved with Halloween\n[noise]\nKelly knew the people that worked at the gate so we got to skip the lines and head straight through the VIP entrance this was a fall extravaganza bursting with orange orange leaves painted site or signs donuts cops even the punk and chunk and welcome sign was orange\nHave you ever reached down and pick up the pumpkin and realize there was really a schoolteachers backside and orange stretch pants [noise]\nI have\nThere's a good energy to fall festival it's as if everyone knows that this was the last\nChance you'll see your neighbors before everyone climbs back into their dens and hide out until spring like bears with Amazon accounts\n[noise]\nThere were men with beer bellies wearing Denver Broncos jerseys I saw a grandmother chasing her grandson around the hay bale young skater kids dressed like winter surfers\nAnd man and well worn cowboy hats and despite what they tell us on the news we weren't at each other's throats we were enjoying each other's company and smiling with candy corns in our teeth\nWe grab some ... donuts Kelly took out or flask import a little something extra into her cubs she said this helps fight the cold and that if anyone gets fresh with us it will help us fight them to [noise]\nWe walked around the grounds and looked at the courthouse dolls scare crows were crooked smiles and pies I Love pi if there is a pie around you can guarantee someone's trying to have a good time\nPie show up at parties Thanksgiving and warm diners on cold winter nights you never see a pie it a crime scene\n[noise]\nHave you ever went looking for the bathroom in the fall festival got turned around ... strangers running the other way and realized you were lost and corn may [noise]\nI have [noise]\nI don't understand why people like these corn mazes being lost isn't fun being lost the stressful being lost all you have to pay it's even more stressful [noise] being lost when you have to pay what pumpkins or catapulted over your head is the most stress I've had all year [noise]\nHave you ever stood in the corn ... can do that in your hand next to a three year old boy named Kevin while you're both cried for your mommy [noise]\nI have\nKevin his mom and dad eventually found us they were very nice
