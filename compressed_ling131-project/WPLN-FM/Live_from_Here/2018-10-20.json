I started walking back to our travelling corresponded comedian Tom pop up in a second we caught up in America are you there Tom I'm here\nCrafts that was a beautiful song it was fun listening to it from inside this parking garage\nBut I'm ready to go on behalf of live from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I traveled to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie where the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the color purple leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeve shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years in her cab was filled with stuffed animals they lined the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys\nShe goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger they don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids I\nGuess that was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie after growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because they wanted to go to the hottest\nPlace I could find but it turns out I'm not built for the desert seems more like a place for lizards people who stay there too long start to look like a sponge that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water man I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on them is from Niagara Falls are you here to see the falls\nHave you ever lied your cab driver about seeing Niagara Falls because you didn't want her to know you planned your entire trip around eating buffalo wings\n[noise] I have\nTo drop me off downtown and I went out looking for a bar if you're looking for a bar or tavern buffalo is a good place to look they have a lot of them and last call his four AM they say they're staying up to open later gives the snow plows time to clear your way home [noise]\nI entered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of signed coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place that so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender was a big bear of a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and in crowds while he worked he said that he's been in this bar for Thirty years and that he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more\nPeople come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell as saying who knows maybe it's me they smell [noise]\n\nAre eagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started protesting your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife down\nThe kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking I don't understand what everybody's after I mean sure moving to another city you might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost\nEveryone complains about their parents until they shell out twenty dollars an hour for a babysitter and then suddenly we're not so bad [noise]\nHe keeps you busy with this bowling league he said people like to knock bowling but it's a damn good game especially when you have your own shoes\nHe pointed their wallet bowling trophies behind them that his team and one throughout the years\nTheir name is great balls of fire but this year we're a little nervous we lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was ...\nAmong the trophies was affiliated newspaper article featuring a high school football team there was a picture of Chris he was a captain in the last year they won the state championship\nThis was a different life it's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings\nI have\nAnd boy were they hide my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I wasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried to act cool and in front of a bunch of\nLocals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot [noise]\nI have\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes restarting the fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and becomes difficult I looked up to the sky as a snowflake landed on my cheek\nAnd I brushed it off\nHave you ever forgot that you would wing sauce on your fingers touch dry and had to run into a bar to beg a giant bartender to throw beer in your face [noise] I have\nAnd that's why I'm not a local but I'll return to buffalo just as soon as the snow melts and I buy some gloves until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nUm [noise] for some out\nCity Missouri to trim and Peter on November first\nHey this is more in treating [noise]\nI don't know [noise]\n\n[noise] I\nTown\nMuch more at live from here dot org lead from here is produced by American public media\nSupport
