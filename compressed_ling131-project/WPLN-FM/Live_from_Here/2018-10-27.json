our ... in America Tom are you there\nI'm here Chris on behalf of why from here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York on them as I rolled into New York city there's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone [noise]\nThe streets worse colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nIs a hat [laughter] I have [noise]\nI walked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there is nothing crazier than in New York dog park these are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are pets that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York\nPost when they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds I sat next\nTo one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco\nWith a spike collar and an upper lip and the permanence ...\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was one man thing about how the city has changed\nThere's no scene for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who are too strange to live in their hometowns but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city there are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park\nRocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pug a purebred German Shepherd and a French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nList as New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous\nThe bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume or the scariest part of Halloween\nAt least one of the child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise] and they had a down McDougal\nStreet I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty murdered his face painful smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they ... to [noise] did they live in a magical lamb should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree [noise]\nAnd I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mind and walk them down the street\nHave you ever gotten looks from strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nTried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto him\nUrban might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes they created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out\nIt's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dressed like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side throws in like a very koala bears [laughter]\nI've never heard a live ... I couldn't tell you what kind of noise they made this one let out little half Yeltsin runs that broke my heart [laughter]\nJust as I was about to help three others Merce came running up and grabbed him\nHis mom lost brothers hug them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white from I felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away\nHave you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\n[noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train as a bank you we went to Joe is on ... street and sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window most people just fight through the crowd and take their slice outside\nI was worried about causing is seen by walking in with these murders\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy dabble a hotdog a Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looks like it's the captain who turned out not to be in costume at all\n[noise]\nDaily rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weird I was they have a happy Halloween everybody and until next time this has been Tom pop out in America [noise]\nTake a job [noise] 'cause\nBut I can also\nBe Syria because now I'm In a business off then there are papers in a telephone on a desk in front of me just if you enjoy paper or telephones that are plugged into a wall and\nYou are going to want to vote for me [noise]\nJust remember if you want things like changing or change but also want\nEverything to exactly the same I Am clearly the best choice to represent here [noise]\nNow I have a hard hat on [noise] so let's get building some saying I'm candidate and I approve this message paid for by a dark honey\nAfter\nA short intermission you are listening to live from here coming ... from the center for performing arts in Nebraska\n[noise]\nFrom here is supported by the F and P certified financial planner professionally trained in providing holistic financial planning in their client's best interest\nFor short and long term goals from starting a business to leaving for college to retirement but to make a blend dot org and by ... meal prep service deliverance fresh gourmet dinner kids that are table ready in Fifteen minutes just one bad\nApple does to prep work so you spend less time shopping more time with family\nWere more on global dot com slash law firm here\nIn and buy home advisor measure homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home project from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local ... book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd buy T Rowe price offering the strategic investing approach that examines investment opportunities first and institutions advisors employers end individuals' choose to row price of fuel price invested with confidence\nAnd by fractured creating modern photo decorum gifts by printing photos directly on the last ...\nOr ... an image frame and found all in one hand made an carbon neutral Florida factory and learn more at ... dot com slash law and\nThereby progressive insurance offering a way to buy home insurance with their home quote lure too old goes to coach and rates are available online learn more and progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive and a lot of progress\nAnd my mother goose online test prep to the ACT that's designed to improve scores students can get video lessons practiced questions and experts report online rep smart go far and enjoy the ride at ... dot com slash ... ...\nThere's a video killed the radio started I think the Internet is really helping\nA lot from here dot org\nCheck out video clips from to like show and other research favorites Lindsay Buckingham and the war and treaty you can also join us for live video stream from the town hall throughout in December with guests like power John ... and the wolf pack all that and more a law firm\nHere dot org fly from here is produced by American public media\nSupport for Nashville public radio comes from the rhyming welcoming I'm with her along with special guest\nMissed something performing live Thursday February twenty first after I'm an auditorium tickets are available at ticket master ...\nAnd Williamson medical center offering a reminder that mix it up those being met them time off for the holidays and that was a great time to schedule a surgery that's been delayed or get back to feeling better sooner\nWilliams and medical center daughter or\nThis is not the point three WPN Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WPN Alta Loma in Ninety One point seven W.
