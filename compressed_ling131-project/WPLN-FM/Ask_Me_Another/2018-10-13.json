ensemble cast\nWhere everyone supposedly liked each other uh what is the secret ingredient just just be around women [laughter]\nHave everyone would be a woman [laughter] [noise] I\nYou know from experience it's it's a really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite war ... well you know how they brainwashed us in the past it's like catty women riding\nHis you know the skin jealousy competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like it I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women in spaces where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage yeah I mean I'm\nYou know I think I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present 'em in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in a actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever\nHappened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and that in me I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed in life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy\nKnow I figure I'll everything out and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story um luckily\nI thought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're hot [laughter] I'm way because especially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and and different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not\nThat we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf we moved the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nIt was it was like cats at a bag and do all this work\n[laughter]\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give them your job [laughter] you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself in this\nIs you know do all this work on top of this\nWork yeah and it also led to obviously you decided to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided to ... and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah ... it is called my family divided one girl's journey of home last and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already the easy\nBook um and why do people come up\nTo me all the time it's like your book I read it in one sitting it's easier\nYeah I I uh I gave her younger students [laughter]\nThose are the students that have been responding to this story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult [noise]\nSo yeah that's why he found it easy [laughter]\nAnd now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series well trying okay\nI'm In talks right now of developing 'em either a series or a town I'm I can take in many different directions but that's sort of like
