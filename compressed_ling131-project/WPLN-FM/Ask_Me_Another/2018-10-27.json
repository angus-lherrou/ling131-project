[noise]\nYou Jonathan it's time to bring out our special guest he's eight Tony Award as a nominee for his portrayal of sponge Bob square pants on Broadway please welcome ... eat then later [noise]\n\nEven welcome thank you for having me so exciting to have you here so let's start from the beginning of your sponge Bob journey yes they're fine with me where you were and what you were doing when you received the information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants\nI was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar the brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole kit that lived on that in that year so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call and it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really round\nI wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title teen Atlanta project but we think you might be the right shape for it [laughter]\nYeah that hurt I won't hurt a little bit I've gotten over it well you didn't know\nWhat they were talking about it oh no they they said the the name of chipper chip and just we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm was that guy is a dish and how cool is going to be a\nAnd like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob do in the hands by like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob [laughter]\nUm that is a crazy coincidence it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive\nHigh pitched kind of gig leave voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right\nYeah that was like both I'm a conscious decision as an artist and also a choice that I made out of fear and eight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me\nSo I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um\nAnd the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina Landau the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\nCool for cocoa\nYes he says you're you are studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and\nJuliet did you know yeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like a huge for me it was like going to be my first professional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise]\nWhich was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of his workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I I've been doing to Shakespeare show since I was a little kid and DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor\nAt the time and he said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious pass\n[laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics you were jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense\nSo what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training is this five years you've been already has shown me up on six wow\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great ... right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah\nWhen you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas\n... yeah that's right that I I get thank you to a you know Jonathan those and yeah my contortion teacher I may they may I was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot\nAnd you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your out\nStick person hopefully we totally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privileges you know being the sponge\nShows a week um when did you first notice that I don't\nI don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around everyone people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and with sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\nThat feels really like a river [noise]\n\nAh All right are you ready for an asked me another challenge yes I Am fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer a sponge Bob square pants\nThe musical Kyle Jericho every body\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you actually ... okay so you you wrote the book how many years did you have you been working on this project\nI think I've been involved almost six years okay yeah here's\nWhat is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of this story has\nIt changed from day one yeah it has I mean we knew okay here's the challenge rights but from a TV they're eleven minute episode yes Broadway show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks the emotional states that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there is going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nSpongebob his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they looked at ... Fisher for cleaner\nFish for sure you have to clarify the I just saw myself in every single one of those fashion\nYou're at and they ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nWell you know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this world is the only land mammal right there are aquatic mammals there is a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you I don't mind below so that if this person going to be honest [laughter]\n[noise] support for NPR comes from the station and from the ...
