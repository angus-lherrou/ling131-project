out that you know you've been playing for a long time but you've got a drum kit when you were five years old\nYeah that was my first instrument I was in love with Ringo Starr [laughter]\nSomehow my parents convinced me that the guitar was a much nicer instrument and now with a gifted to you as a five year old you know one of those things were someone's like ha ha ha\nOh really yeah and so they're like okay we're going to get you a little kid drank and then they decided you know [laughter]\nAnd so at what point did you start playing guitar so right afterwards so I I my first guitar I had an electric guitar and I had a big gap and I was like about two feet high and really yeah I was a shredder from right\nFrom the beginning of right from the beginning and then when did it turn into this is my profession this is what I'm doing for my loving my career forever\nOh not till I dropped out my third year of college okay so you go to ... yeah I thought like who makes a living doing music yeah\nRight no so you know what happened on my third year I went to Spain and my friends and I decided what let's go bus go on the streets and I had all these songs that I'd written but they were my\nPersonal journals and and it was the first time I ever sang and it was the first day was saying on the street and some guy walked by and he said would you like to play my nightclub\nAnd if we we thought like a you know young American girls and it ended up being legitimate and I wonder if that guy had um walked by what would have how would I be doing\nAnd how was that gig in Spain and it was fantastic\nSo then when you were inspires who'd you're like this is it just was is it okay so you have engaged your fan base to help you find your projects you actually you do this with themselves or kills you also did the same thing with California years originally when you put it out called ... next record\nThem before a Kickstarter right in fact I was one of the first to do a kind of tiered level I had polished rock to weapons grade plutonium\nAnd ah and in fact the guys from Kickstarter they before they started they had meetings like how did you\nHow do you do and um of what an idiot why didn't I think of as of this or not but it was fantastic so ... what did you do it on a just a Web page or how did I had a friend we just did it because I knew I wasn't going to get a record deal the big one and I\nI have small but mighty fan base and and uh\nAnd and I had no idea what what happened what would happen\nAnd so the response was great you're like I'm actually doing an album hair people's paid for it yeah and then uh I mean so what year was that two thousand nine thousand eight two dozen an age it's clearly different than doing it now ah how I mean how has it changed between doing it then and now with your current\nProactively forever deal because back I was so scared that I wouldn't do as well because back then there was you know now you're inundated by people saying you know help them with their ... their everything yeah so there was nothing else like that\nCNN and other news sources were interested like what is this so I got a lot of publicity for work and you know what I stopped\nAt a certain level because\n... yeah he put up this really mean ugly picture of me with the dollar signs saying greedy greedy greedy awful Jill Sylvia will you know asking are fans and so I quit it and then six months later everyone starts doing it right or what a different time for a data notion of grades\nYeah a yes on my God\nYeah right so now you're doing it you know for your last album ah in the beginning you know you don't have the the whole infrastructure now it's very clear that you have to offer your fans something kind of authentic and cool as a reward\nFunding right yeah so I did try to do it this time like last time yeah so I had some pretty interesting ones so what did you offer people well as a joke I had my highest level was I Will put on the record and you
