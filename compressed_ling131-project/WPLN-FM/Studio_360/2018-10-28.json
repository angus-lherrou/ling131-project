from the actual subject to wish [noise] studios thinks it's good Anderson\n[noise]\nIn the summer Nineteen editor my friends and I shot a rose movie on the streets to Singapore that was to become a kind of\nUrban legend\nThat's filmmaker Sandy time on their ratings at the beginning of her terrific documents that movie\nAvoiding harm [laughter] [noise]\nIn St the harrowing sixteen year old killer named as [noise]\nHer new documentary is kind of uh making of film but it's about that film that never got Senate and that's because right after her movie rap twenty six years ago\nHer director and mentor a mysterious guy named George car Dona\nJust disappeared along with every frame of film her doc is called ... same name as the original future and earlier this year one of ... directing award at the Sundance Film festival and it is now just rolling out on Netflix\nWhen Sandy Tong Kim industrial three sixty I asked her how she became such a movie obsessions as a kid and Singapore in the Nineteen eighties\nI guess I Would say Keanu Reeves was my gateway drug um say hassle the the St ... society and just showing like river's edge or something when I was like fourteen\nAnd uh but you know I wound up staying and watching fleeting and Fellini eight and a half was was the thing kind of let me down another rabbit hole on and just boring enough then to allow me time to a daydream which is I think it's a really important for films throw you for you as a teenager\nSo so by the time you were born there you could buy tapes write a film\nUm you could not it was very very difficult to look for movie so you have to go across the causeway to Malaysia to look for pirated movies and I have a cousin in Florida\nAnd so I had her you know rent the movies I Want to see like a wild at heart and um move out of it things like that and then she put them all on this one VHS but you know in those days you could take them at triple ... like three movies on one tape and then when you watch them when you arrive at your house\nUm does it take that triple ... they're kind of fuzzy and you're watching them and they're they have this kind of mistake um religious quality has to to them when you're watching them as a teenager like after it's been shipped to your house and you put it onto your VCR and watched it like a late at night and it's got this kind of I don't know if it had its effect on me or go to movies that\nBut you seemed like I was gonna say when the interesting things is describing these young teenage girls in Singapore being the what seemed like the coolest punky is geeks in town right\nA potentially groundbreaking film from twenty Thirty years ago I I thought it was Anderson as well you know not many years after you made your original film truckers his breakthrough film Rushmore\nCame out which was a kind of cinematic cousin yeah young people bright colors vary structure you know stylized shots or that must have felt a little bittersweet\nI at goose bumps watching Rushmore I I just you know there were the emphasis in primary colors um useful heroes that the young person who has these these strange friendships with older people you know the company I can\nSay that\nYou have a pretty figure it out [noise]\nJust got to find something you left to do and then do with your life [noise]\nThat's ... in a Wes Anderson is Rushmore from Nineteen Ninety eight\nWhen I was watching the film I was like oh my God that's what we were going for it and no one to tell I mean nobody but believe me I Would just sounds so grandiose and that was really frustrating for me and again when I saw a Ghost World that I felt the same\nThing with the same kind of ... of colors broadly offbeat humor and and poker face humor [noise]\nYou know like the luckiest guy in the world\nHave stuff like that [noise] play if I hadn't kill me oh come on what are you talking about ... you think it's healthy obsessively collect things [noise] can't connect with other people see it [noise]\nSo your life with stuff just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers\nThat's Ghost World a sore birch and I'm Steve ... a two thousand one your film a from a decade earlier a is less realistic about this school girl serial killer a a kind of a kindred in the comedy sensibility\nOh yeah definitely I mean if it didn't have the sense of humor it wouldn't be fun right\nAnd there's a kind of a dead bands surrealism that I associate more with modern American ...\nYeah I like John ... um I think John which is a big influence around well like visually say\nAnd I would I Want to pause if we can on ... who who is who is there is a kind of number belly laugh comic under his whole thing what particular\nI think it was generally um maybe there was a bit of um the look of a mystery train\nAnd then there was you know and if I'm you know some of the colors that this movie's brimming with like bright colors in primary colors and\nWe were going for something that was completely uh in opposition to stare out um you know just grey Singapore um St Bart's responsibility in school and business and offices\nUm so there was a bit of John Waters this well on a lot of the American indie aesthetic we were going to\nWe were in and you know recently um a friend of mine was friends with Jay Root benefits I think um and it's ... and he saw some of the footage in his jaw dropped because he thought it was some collective unconscious you know some something that was going on where these kids and that is very different part of the world were\nDoing something that kind of looked like they were trying for something that that people in America we're doing at the same dry no it\nIs like an alternate history that has been suppressed at least to me and to everybody about your friends and you until now um but but it is like a like a weird natural experiments of global culture the dirty words tune in Singapore\nFeeding off the same influences like guys fumes or whatever as these directors in America at the turn of the century yeah\nYeah I mean it really feels like that right it doesn't really feel like like that like you you you are this experiment that there is such a thing as a global ... yeah yeah um so\nYou get the film back you made this documentary you had some kind of a reunion with your friends is mystery solved found out who George was a\nNetflix is showing this stock is good happy ending\nUm yeah I think it's it's like that to me is like the stranger than fiction aspect of it I mean this was like one small little event and the smallest country in the world
