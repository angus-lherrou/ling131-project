[noise]\nSo it's funny it is that there are no fish and um it is I mean people it is to turn a fiction but\nIt's not a comic no that's right\nThat's right I mean I think the the sort of instinct for the book was um you know I teach at a college than I spend a lot of time trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world and there was a moment in or\n[noise]\nThing\nFor those of us old enough to remember the ... well he was is accordion playing bandleader who had a variety show on TV from the early fifties to the early eighties\nAnd he had this curious Eastern European accent he'd been born and raised in rural North Dakota but in this German speaking community as a child in the Nineteen sixties I remember both sets of mine to brass good grandparents were watching the show on Saturday night's primetime ABC\nAnd talking about generation gaps to me at the time ... was the epitome\nOf cheesy and David and square\nWhich is exactly how Paul folks dealt about the show was a kid ... now teaches media and communication at New York university and the College of Staten Island and for our future called guilty pleasures he talks about how his opinion shifted a hundred and eighty degrees [noise]\nAs a kid I remember my grandfather a cattle farmer in South eastern Iowa he was a very quiet man has to turn would be that\nWould be the best word\nProbably Saturday evening says when he watch TV\nWhen Laurence welk came on\nWe're happy you could join us as we have a full menu of champagne me the gentleman went to the\nFirst thing of course is the hair the over the\nTop hair styles that sets were just so you know so\nColorful and the costumes of course are full color and then\nThe singing the kids come in here and of course today sincerity is not hip not [noise]\nMore and spoke his corny and cheesy and that's part of what what's great\nI call it my guilty pleasure\nBut I don't feel\nAbout it actually I think it's cool the whole idea of camp is your perspective more than the actual content so you can watch it as camp you can watch it in in this\nThat's something that I still enjoy it in this ironic fashion I find it all areas still but I came to love it is more than something to laugh at\nAll of our refining accordion is Myron floor and all of the champagne music makers chime in with that all time favorite stumbling one [noise]\nFirst thing you notice about Lawrence Welk as he has just really strange\nEnglish wasn't his first language in Sherman was his first language and that's why he has this weird accent\nI felt a little bit of a kind of have a little water before on the show\nHe carried the baton and he played the accordion\n\n\nThis is what's so great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nDiversion America happened famously many fields government education entertainment and here's one Irish men who is pretty well known for his grade attend our boys of course I'm speaking up our own Joe ... of course I play\nInto whatever their immigrant past cliche so he's wearing a green food and you singing my Irish rose\n\n\n\nThere's this point where she holds the microphone for him to kind of get him to raise his voice to a higher note they\n\nThere's this great rapport between them\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nThen at the end he says listen to the\nExtent that nice that he would let a German player for an Irish men\nThere [noise] he's referring to himself as a\nGerman but of course is a German American there's a recognition that America of course is the land of ... of immigrants [noise] this is something that has been often lost in our contemporary rural America I think\nThe gentleman I'm wearing the official jacket of the future farmers of America\nThis is a modern foreign and he's the Norwegian when Laurence welk refers to him\nThis is a national organization of some four hundred thousand high school boys on the farming areas of America\nAnd this was a group that every kid they grew up in a small town like my father my father was a member would belong to the expectation of course was that that you would become a farmer eventually as well [noise]\nYou know since the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies rural America has emptied out [noise]\nThe town that my father grew up in er my grandfather farmed it's a ghost town that's why there's a certain melancholy to this show and to the program [noise]\n\n[noise] oh one of the act I remember on the Lawrence Welk show\nIs the tap dancer Arthur Duncan who is one of the first African\nCats TV [noise] [noise]\nSo here Arthur Duncan is tap dancing [noise]\nThe women are singing and looking honesty tap dances and [noise]\nAfter Duncan was key to kind of preserving this very much African American cultural tradition Laurence welk considered him part of the family the musical family\nSo she sang with danced with white women\nIt was seen as completely normal this was back in the sixties and seventies when there's still a lot of discomfort with racial integration this was a time when I was going to school and there was a lot of protests about integrating the schools\nSo in in a subtle way he's challenging this\nLong long time of year round [noise] it'd be a long way to the mall in\nThis scene is basically a Thanksgiving dinner table where\nThey're all sitting around and they start singing this beautiful song beef thing for\n\nLaw\nThe line Andy\nThey're sitting at this table there's Arthur Duncan all the food is there [noise]\nYou have to spotlight coming down as if from heaven on the front of the table where we're Jimmy Roberts is singing\n\nThe song be thankful was written by urban Taylor who was the Jewish New York\nThis song is a recognition that everything you have if you are a believer comes from God so you should be thankful that you are so blessed to have what you have\nOf course the implications for me are that you should reach out to help others\nOr is\nThis particular scene I think it's just so powerful because it it has this kind of utopian vision of family that\nIs not based on its base on\nFriendship and love and joy and\nIt's not based on exclusion it's based on the inclusion people from very diverse backgrounds\nWho know me will\nBe\nIn our contemporary world where there\n\n\nThat he was one of them are performing ... grow it's from your new album halo a widow the insurance on guitar keyboard and chemicals in public on ... on ... yeah\nUm it's kind of a family business your father or maybe rest in peace he recently died yes Russia leader a with a very well known a tank or a musician yeah in the country of ... what did he make of your music\nAt the beginning he he always thought\nIt was a genius how genius you are I may just be so a self conscious about being a genius without any skills so and\nShe may just be too self conscious about\nWhat would they do what we did it so we couldn't just start with a very bad ban them play anywhere because that was really bad we need to start and a great and you're actually exactly so I I feel that I didn't have the time to learn from from the button\nAnd then I became a ... a comedian I Know just to make not due to be\nMy guitar and that's really ... and that ... that's what I read\nThat and and and work up the videos of you being this big comedy star with your own show at age thirty one um in fact we have a clip of you from your big show or in the early nineties um wanna be suicide among us\nAnd in this up so you you're playing a panelist on a TV talk show who talks on and on without ever getting to a point\nAnd they know they have found that ... ... yeah gone finances they say [laughter]\nAnd a half ass\nSo acting and and comedy that that that began just as a day job to try to\nI guess I I said okay I can do this I Know I have this character that I can impersonate 'cause I thought to me I really want to make music but how can they afford\nTo play musical they know without having to work all day long how can I Do that ... that that has to pay but then I go I went well you're a star and that was when everything was kind of forgotten\nAnd meaning that I was caught in my own truck because I had found the solution to be able to have money to play music and then the solution became the main thing\nAnd and then when I realized that was happening I stopped everything we can yes had already passed\nBut such a admirable a presence of mind and fortitude to say nope I'm giving that I'm giving stardom up to go back to what they want to do that that's kind of extraordinary\n... honest after I had been wanting to do this\nSince I was really little dial right and I thought I pictured myself in the future laying in bed being really old watching\nVideos on MTV and being really angry I could have a career that I could have been I could I Would have done it better that sucks oh I hate them all as something like that\nSo your first time comes that you're you're not kidding you're you're thirty something um did you feel as though okay I'm doing a lot I'm doing music at\nThis age rather than young because I Do experience that are known to be hot now [laughter] no no no I'm always\nRegretting
