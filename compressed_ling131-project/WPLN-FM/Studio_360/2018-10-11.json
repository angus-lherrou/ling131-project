was um you know I teach at a college then they spend a lot of time trying to pay attention to what's happening in the world and there was a moment in or\n[noise]\nThing\nFor those of us old enough to remember the real Laurence welk [noise] he was is accordion playing bandleader who had a variety show on TV from the early fifties to the early eighties\nAnd he had this curious Eastern European accent he'd been born and raised in rural North Dakota but in this German speaking community as a child in the Nineteen sixties I remember both sets of mine in Nebraska grandparents were watching the show on Saturday nights prime time ABC\nAnd talking about generation gaps to me at the time Laurence welk was the epitome\nOf cheesy and dated and square which is exactly how Paul folks dealt about the show was a kid ... now teaches media and communication at New York university and the colleges Staten Island\nAnd for our future called guilty pleasures he talks about how his opinion shifted a hundred and eighty degree [noise]\nAs a kid I remember my grandfather a cattle farmer in South eastern Iowa he was a very quiet man\nHas to turn would be that\nWould be the best word\nProbably Saturday evening is when\nHe watch TV when Laurence welk came on\nWe're happy you could join us that we have a full menu of champagne music gentleman quite to the\nFirst thing of course is the hair the over the top hair styles that sets were just so you know so colorful and the costumes of course are full color and then\nThe singing they're just so since here and of course today sincerity is not hip not [noise]\nMore and spoke his corny and cheesy and that's part of what what's great\nI call it my guilty pleasure\nBut I don't feel\nAbout it actually I think it's cool the whole idea of camp is your perspective more than the actual content so you can watch it as camp you can watch it in in this ironic fashion that's something that I still enjoy it in this house\nI came to love it is more than something to laugh at\nOur very fine according to spy on the floor and all of the champagne music makers chime in on with that all time favorite stumbling one [noise]\nFirst thing you notice about Lawrence Welk as he has this really strange\nEnglish wasn't his first language in Sherman was his first language and that's why he has this weird access\nI felt a little bit of a kind of have a little water before on the show\nHe carried the baton and he played the accordion\n\nThis\nIs what's so great about the show is there's this connection to people's immigrant\nDiversion America happened famously many fields government education entertainment and here's one Irish men who is pretty well known for his grade attend our boys of course I'm speaking up our own Joe ... of course I can\nPlay into whatever their immigrant past cliche so he's wearing a green suit and you singing my Irish rose\n\nMan\nThere's this point where he holds the microphone for him to kind of get him to raised his voice to a higher note they\n\n\nThere's this great rapport between them\n[noise]\nAnd\nThen at the end he says listen to the\nExtent that nice that he would let a German player for an Irishman\nHere [noise] he's referring to himself as a\nGerman but of course is a German American there's a recognition that America of course is the land of ... of immigrants [noise] this is something that has been often lost in our contemporary rural America I think\nThat I'm wearing the official jacket of the future farmers of America\nThis is a modern foreign and she's the Norwegian when Laurence welk refers to him\nThis is a national organization of some four hundred thousand high school boys on the farming areas of America\nAnd this was a group that every kid they grew up in a small town like my father my father was a member would belong to the expectation of course was that that you would become a farmer eventually as well [noise]\nYou know since the Nineteen sixties and Nineteen seventies rural America has emptied out\nThe town that my father grew up in er my grandfather farmed it's a ghost town that's why there's a certain melancholy to this show and to the program [noise]\n\n[noise] oh one of the act I remember on the Lawrence Welk show is the tap dancer or their Duncan who is one of the first African Americans on broadcast TV [noise]\n[noise]\nArthur Duncan is tap\nDancing [noise]\n\n\nThe women are singing and looking on his he tap dances and [noise]\nAfter Duncan was key to kind of preserving this very much African American cultural tradition Laurence welk considered him part of the family the musical family\nSo she sang with danced with white women [noise]\nIt was seen as completely normal this was back in the sixties and seventies when there's still a lot of discomfort with racial integration\nThis was a time when I was going to school and there was a lot of protests about integrating the schools so in in a subtle way he's challenging this\nLong long way round [noise] it'd be a long way to be on the ball and\nThis singing is basically a Thanksgiving dinner table where they're all sitting around and they started singing this beautiful song be thankful\n\nLaw\nThe line Andy\nThey're sitting at this table there's Arthur dunk and all the food is there [noise]\nYou half the spotlight coming down as if from heaven on\nThe front of the table where we're Jimmy Roberts is singing\n\nThe song be thankful was written by are being Taylor who was the Jewish New York\nThis song is a recognition that everything you half if you are a believer comes from God so you should be thankful that you are so blessed to have what you have\nOf course the implications for me are that you should reach out to help others\nOr\nThis particular scene I think it's just so powerful because it it has this kind of utopian vision of family that\nIs not based on blood it's based on\nFriendship and love and joy and it's\nNot based on exclusion it's based on named\nCollusion people from very diverse backgrounds\nWho know me will oh is he\nHe\n\nJust wanted Molina performing ... it's from your new album halo a widow dean shorts on a deterrent you board and okay vocals and public dollars on drum yes\nUm it's kind of a family business your father or maybe rest in peace he recently died yes Russia Molina a with a very well known a tank or a musician yeah in the country of tango what did he make of your music\nAt the beginning he he always thought\nIt was a genius how genius you are I may just be so a self conscious about being a genius without any skills so and\nShe may just be too self conscious about\nWhat would they do what we did and so we couldn't just start with a very bad bound and play anywhere because that was really bad we need to start and a great and you're really written actually exactly so I I feel that I didn't have the time to learn from from the button\nAnd and then I became an actual case a comedian I Know just to make money to to be able to pay my rent on 'em and pay my guitar less really as a ... that's what I read that and and and\nOf you being this big comedy star with your own show at age thirty one\nUm in fact we have a clip of you from your big show or in the early nineties um ... it was sort of minor and in this episode you you're playing a panelist on a TV talk show who talks on and on without ever getting to a point\nAnd they know\nWhat I found that the study ... yet gone finances they say that [laughter]\nAnd access\nSo acting and and comedy that that that began just as a day job to try to\nI guess I I said okay I can do this I Know I have this character that I can impersonate because I thought I really want to make music but how can they afford\nTo play music all day long without having to work all day long how can I Do that on TV that has to pay but then I go I said well you're a star and that was when everything was kind of forgotten\nAnd meaning
