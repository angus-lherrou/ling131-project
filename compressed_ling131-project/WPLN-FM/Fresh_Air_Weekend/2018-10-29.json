congratulations on it this is a really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nBut I wouldn't call it a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross back with Melissa McCarthy she co starred in bridesmaids start in the heat and now stars on the new film can you ever forgive me as\nA biographer turned literary forgery it's based on a memoir by the Israel [noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults\n[laughter] insulting no I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but but the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all\nCalled in to meet with the principal and the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hear him say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... and our kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no when he when he said to me was he told me what language Catherine let me get a relay what these two balls said to me unless I say you\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager ... next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like you're a big commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in the job with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens when you corner you corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\nOkay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty it's just you kind of improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for\nTo do really funny and solve no I Know I Do not oh go around insulting people I Hope ever\nBut the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] and never say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with was to sit for watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say every anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about either acting or comedy which came first like acting or comedy comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of\nSuddenly and I moved to New York when I was twenty kind of out of the blue or hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I'd moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering\nAnd uh had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city\nAnd our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and they said All right [noise] I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling my parents saying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion I wanted to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise]\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought they think I'm going to go this direction\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because [noise]\nYou know the heckling wasn't there\nWhen you went into a regular comedy club you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter]\nLike I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes [noise]\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it so in order to actually make them\nBe quiet I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nDon't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not\nHow was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road of like going to get a show of hands for women who isn't crazy about this guy and if you take your shirt off and like and I would you vote soon and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she is a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with\nNow he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching sang times oh my God so I\nKnow there's the light oh ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't know what the light man I Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night is also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get for ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up\nPeople actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booze\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me\nHe is really encouraging me and then I finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt\nTo make sure that you can act immaterial that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like\nThe perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are filled with\nUm\nUm [noise]\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend and Terry Gross my guest Paul day now is probably best known for his performance in there will be blood as a teenage evangelical preacher imagine being in your early twenties and working on that film with director Paul Thomas Anderson an actor Daniel Day Lewis\nDino was only twelve when he had a part in the Broadway revival of inherit the wind starring George the Scott\nDino also co starred in the films Little Miss sunshine twelve years a slave and portrayed Brian Wilson in the film love and mercy now the age of thirty four he directed his first film called wildlife\nThe screenplay which dino co wrote with his partners away 'cause then is adapted from a Richard Ford novel of the same name wild life is about a fourteen year old boy Joe who was recently moved with his parents to a small town in Montana he hasn't yet made friends and he's looking to his parents were sense of home and stability\nBut his father played by Jake Gyllenhaal loses his job and his sense of purpose the mother played by Carey Mulligan takes a part time job to help make ends meet\nMeanwhile it's wildfire season and the father decides to joined the men fighting fire which leaves his wife and son to fend for themselves during the in determinant period he'll be gone\nAnd that changes everything just as fires can get out of control soak in people's lives\nHere's a scene in which Joe comes home from school to find his father breaking the news to his mother that he's leaving them to fight the wildfires sorry I'm late [noise]\nTalk to your father\nI put my name on a list I waited for my chance and now they find a place for me you don't know anything about fire that burned up well I've been reading about them I don't know reading about the events studying words on me gee what's going on the father leaving us go fight those wildfires\nWhy\nWhy are you willing to go through so we'll go out with a bunch of that faith and risk I tell people what is it\nWhat does it pay\nA\nDollar an hour [noise]\nI Would be a law against you know if I was going to go out and everybody knows what do you think about I don't\nKnow if you're not in every time\nYou don't know what I'm doing no problem at Jerry why don't you like a grown man [noise]\n[noise] well they know congratulations on making this film and welcome to fresh air says that this film is adapted from a Richard Ford novel that like your movie is called wild life how did you first find the novel and why did you fall in love with that [noise]\nUm I was a fan of Richard forwards I had just read a book called Rock Springs which is a beautiful collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called book court which is which is now closed looking for any other book of his opened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence\nOr even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nWhen you read the first paragraph from the novel which we happened to have sitting on the table here sure [noise]\nIn the fall of Nineteen sixty when I was sixteen and my father was for a time not working my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him\nThis was in great falls Montana the time of the gypsy base an oil boom and my father had brought us there in the spring of that you're from Lewiston, Idaho in the belief that people small people like him are making money in Montana or soon would be and he wanted a piece of that good luck before all of the collapsed and was going in the wind\nThank you [laughter] language so I I'm a big issue for a fan and before yes I yes I agree so tell us more about what you related to in the story of this is the writing which is beautiful yeah but you are adapting the story so what was it about the story that supposed to\nSo even about twenty pages into the book there's a paragraph about a um kid watching his mom teach one class and thinking that everybody around her thinks oh there's a woman with a good smile or there's a woman with a good figure there's one is happy and he knew something was wrong it home\nAnd at that point my heart sort of left and I was like wow this is as great writing can do or a great song or whatever it is it felt like it for you in some way and that\nI just remember I moved to a new town when I was fourteen\nYour home is sort of the edge of the world when you moved somewhere new ... because you don't know what's outside of it you don't have friends yet you know school is not yet a release um it's sort of scary to go there for the first time and so we grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Manhattan\nI'm really close with my family maybe too close and I remember when my parents started having you know struggles in their relationship sort of what a profound and gets difficult moment that was for me so this book\nSort of reflected back to me how family is one of the greatest loves in our life\nAnd because of that it's also sometimes one of the greatest sources struggle\nCompassion in the clip that we just heard the parents are fighting and one of them says to the teenage boy what do you think Joe [laughter] and like how awkward is asking a teenage boy to weigh in on the battle between his parents were you in that position [noise]\nWell I think so and I think that's something are related to in this character I think somebody else might have wanted to make a film about I'm a kid's rebels writer or something from their youth but for me\nI remember sort of standing in the middle feeling ground shake and not wanting things to tip so ... Joe and I have something in common and Richard Ford and I have something in common in that regard I was somebody who wanted to keep things together so if something like that had been posed to me\nUm you know I said\nI'm Out of here and like what are you know I Would have tried to actually understand what was going on and then kind of help\nDid your parents separate well my parents are interesting situation which is they separated they like the end of this book strangely which is not be on the film ... living together a few years ago may never got officially divorced but we do not always lived together\nLet's talk about your acting and let's start with there will be blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year you're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nDuring the early days when they're discovering that there's oil there and\nThere's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capital as to comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist\nAnd in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one land on her that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agreed to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptized seeing him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another oil accident Daniel Day Lewis sense him away to school [noise] okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nThought well what are you [noise]\nThe laws ... Julie I'm going\nTo result right\nDown on [noise]\n\nWhat do ... [noise]\nFrom here and you wrote and ... and ... but you have\nAlso brought your bad habits as a ... law students after women\nAnd you have a band in your child your child that you raised your band and all because she was sick and us James Stewart said now I Am a sinner him and say it loud to us you know I'm a student\nLoan Daniel I'm a I'm a student I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry or watch a lot of lot you have a band to your child\nOr the bugs and much I Will never backslide whenever it was", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "29"}
