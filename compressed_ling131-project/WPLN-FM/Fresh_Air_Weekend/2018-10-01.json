music director of the Late Show with Stephen cold there will be peace leaders ban stay human he wrote the show's theme he's joining us at the piano to play and saying he has a new album called Hollywood African\nFamily where he got his start when he was eight performing in a family band he left home to study at Juilliard his music is influenced by a wide range of styles and eras from jazz pop so in classical music\nI Want to play something for from your new record Hollywood Africans that's kind of the opposite of the joyful boogie and this is as a St James infirmary and I've heard many versions of us over the years this is I think my favorite because you bring out\nThe desk in it it ... it showed diverge like and um it feels very deeply felt so let's hear the recording and then we'll talk about your interpretation\nOr well\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nUm so that's John ... from his new album Hollywood Africans and John is at the piano so it's a really terrific version of that song I think it's such an interesting contrast to the boogie that we open with 'cause this is so intentionally bear\nSo mhm talk about your interpretation of the song and what's going on with that really drudge like march like set of chords you were using\nOr you got to think of a place and you have to really put yourself in the story my\nGoal is to really be authentic intervene and emotion and for me I have to be at a place so I'm thinking oh the harvest moon I'm thinking of was meaning that is set\nIn New Orleans maybe is Seventeen hundreds or something like that you really feel the urgency of what's going on when you apply that space because you just waiting and waiting in a kind of\nSudden the scene right now are\nYou waiting to see what's going to happen\n\nAnd then of course his tragedy\nUm\nAnd so on you know it's it's really about the scene and then figure out\nHow to infuse it with the blues because the blues feeling is such an important part of telling this story and I love playing the blues so ...\nWhat I sometimes do on the show when I'm Talking to a musician who just doing the kind of musical autobiography is to ask them to redeem assigned to take a song that we wouldn't expect them to like that they do or something that we think of as\nSquare to coordinate your sentimental son beyond redemption that that you love so is it is there a sign like that that comes to mind that you would like to redeem for us\n[noise] well I Love happy and you know it\nI really liked that song titled concern that you're talking about yes you happy and you know I have you clap those hey [laughter] and like you know that's\nIt's something that I like about these kind of melted these kind of nursery rhymes children melodies that are just soak coherent and and they have a um almost like\n\nIt is that question and that's the thing that um I I just love and in music children can respond to it in such an intuitive way this is kind of a\n... no no no no no\n\nAnd that's it oh I get it now if you put a base line on it and some different ... on it you can get a vibe like um\nSome church on in the spring up some of the motions of it and then when you play\n...\n...\n\n\n\n... ... [noise]\n[laughter] you know just as I Do I like it it's cool\nI like it now [laughter] I like it did when they [laughter]\nIf I if you ask me you know ... if you have any you know it ... your hands no law if you have any you know and then you really want to show\nGoing on ... if you're happy and you know ...\n... yes\nBut\n... years have been so wonderful I'm so grateful to you thank you so much you've been so generous with your music with us and and in general um thank you\nThank you so much it's a pleasure to be here and I'm till next time\n[noise] this is fresh air weekend and Terry Gross let's get back to our session with singer and pianist Linda Gail Lewis Jerry Lee Lewis is younger sister and songwriter singer and guitarist Robbie folks they have a new album together called wild wild wild\nYou're both from very different backgrounds so Linda let me ask you a you grew up in a shack in Louisiana would you describe the ...\nWell it was this a gray building that was kind of like how did it in places and we didn't have a bathroom on the inside\nWe had to bathe and attend to add on the porch in the summer or in the kitchen where there's heat in the winter it was tough it was hard living there and it was embarrassing for me when I get off the school bus\n... most of the other kids weren't as poor I didn't see any other ... exactly like that one maybe one or two but still\nWhen it says you getting off the bus and it ... it's it's embarrassing so it was hard for me but you know I was I Believe they are pretty early because you know my brother's got us out of there when I was ten years old\nWell yeah because you know he became famous as Jerry Lee Lewis he signed with San records and people know that story and what um so it must have really profoundly affected your family life when when there was money coming in and he became famous\nOh it was wonderful we went to Memphis I'll Remember our first trip to Memphis it was so great but of course the main thing that I remember that Jerry bought us a new house in town a nice brick home with everything\nBathroom on the inside [laughter] it was lovely and he gave us a thousand dollars to go shopping my mama had two dresses wonder where to church you wanted to wear at home that's all she had\nAnd we took a thousand dollars to ... dress shop and fair day Louisiana about everything they hit and are such is\nEveryone in your family made music right [noise] well\nYes my momma was a great singer she was a strong leader in our church and daddy played guitar and he played a little bit of piano\nSo one thing you have in common in terms of your background\nAlthough Linda there was a famous person in your family well not just Jerry Lewis gimme swagger is your cousin and he's like the famous tell evangelist a a a famous tell evangelists preacher but he he performed in those shows to ... like sing and play\nYes he did and he's a wonderful piano player and he is a wonderful singer and ... yeah he did the right thing and he's a great preacher and and uh he was off of TV for a while because of the scandal but he's back on now\nRight and the scandal involved a prostitute and pornography\n[laughter] I think so yeah [laughter] although there are some little old ladies\nThat think that he was framed [laughter] veteran I did have a couple of of people tell me that yes [laughter] you know take us right well I think that's far fetched okay but I Love that may not say anything bad about him but that they bit farfetched [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] um\nDid you grow up singing in church a lot to [noise]\nUh I did a little bit yeah and er I did a lot\nDid you sing a lot of her songs at home even though he just said a little ...\nYou know I'm I'm trying to remember I did a lot of single with my family and stopped going to church a partly because we're living so far from anything and uh and I do the transportation my parents were churchgoers\nBut uh I think are stopped going to church around age Thirteen and and they were largely like Methodist Church has worked on interesting him and also I mean we weren't like the the real cool music the lender was probably\n[laughter] so Linda I think your family helped build the church that your family belong to\nWell they did you know it was a it was a holy roller church so it wasn't so popular in our little town of therapy that you'd have like a thousand people attending the Baptist church in maybe five hundred the Methodist and two hundred Catholic and about fifty panic hospitals and that was her at her and that was our church\nUm so what kind of music is in the church\nOh it was great music and rub it would have loved it you know have been found in a way to get to church they ignore that one yeah it was just a you know it was wonderful music upbeat most of the time not all the time\nBut it was very um emotional though I mean sometimes it was it was frightening and and sad but when they did those songs like I'll fly away and stuff like that it was absolutely wonderful\n[noise] uh I'm Wondering if your brother and you first got your hands on a piano in church because if you were living in shock I doubt there was a piano and the shack\nWell my mom and dad he found a way to get my brother a piano when he was eight years old in a shack in I guess yeah and they have little holes in it or we were definitely in the shack with holes in it it was it around well he ... they bought it from my aunt my aunt even had a piano she'd bought for her daughter Norma Jean\nAnd Norma Jean just wouldn't take the lessons and play the piano so she says she just wanted to sell it so\nShe sold it to my mom and daddy and daddy mood that piano downstairs by himself no because they lived up over there cafe that they had they had a cafe and they lived up over it so it was upstairs and Jerry told me he said I Can't believe\nHow daddy could move that piano down those stairs minds you have it was an upright piano my brother's still has it\nWow so now that we've talked a little bit about your church backgrounds can I ask you to do a song that you also do on the new album wild wild wild I'm going to ask you to sing your ... of on the Jericho road and um did you both know the sun before you decided to do it together\nWell I was sitting at a Burger King and Trump's in Norway I got an email from robbing saying well we need to do some gospel and I suggested Jericho road did not robbing\nYou did yeah I mean you were directed me to uh to juries are in ...\nAll beyond all then I immediately tell you I'm not playing that piano so low that I made you play the guitar solo you made me play the guitar [laughter] not really and I asked you know we came up with a bomb bomb\nActually traveled along [noise] oh my ... room for them to read I don't care really\nJust bring it to pry your sins all kinds of Jericho road\n[noise] your heart he will lay\nOn the Jericho road on the Jerry roe there's room for just to their friends are just too or no more no less known lauro not only Jesus anew young we brought in his star oh he'll\nNever K rations Jesus is this new\nSeason and\n\n\nOh thank you for that I loved it [laughter] it's at all [laughter] it was wonderful\nSo we just heard you saying the Jericho road which is a a very Christian song and Linda I think you're still in the church\nUh well I'm not exactly in a church they won't have me\nBut I Am a Christian [laughter] the bigger still Christian\nYeah I haven't found one that would agree with everything I Do but [laughter] but yes I I Do go to church occasionally but uh I don't like belong to a church but but I'm I'm very spiritual and and I love the lord\nAnd Rob me as I remember from last interview you completely moved away from the church\nYeah I'm an atheist which I haven't really discussed with Linda until this moment but there it is he okay with that land\nAlready knew that he was an atheist I read it on one of those social media thanks\n[laughter] your secret as long as I Love singing lesson\nI really do I mean they're great songs I mean songs about belief you know that's what makes a love song great because you believe it when you're saying and a song about transcendental belief or to me are are all the more\nPowerful [laughter] um ... what did your parents think being such\nChurch people when Jerry Lee Lewis along with you his younger sister started performing these wild sons totally secular kind of platform is probably ... within your church um so how how that all over in the family not grant that he was bringing in a lot of money and got the family out of poverty so\nI'm sure they like that but there was a lot that went along with that\nBut you know my parents defended my brother always and and they didn't necessarily agree with his theory which is that he was doing the devils music they didn't really feel that like he did\nAnd but the the people in the church weren't happy with us I mean mama would still go and she take me whether a lot of times and people weren't all that nice to us in the church anymore\nBut uh but Gerry feels like you know he used to feel like that was the devils music I don't know if he feels that way so much now I think he's mellowed on that", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "01"}
