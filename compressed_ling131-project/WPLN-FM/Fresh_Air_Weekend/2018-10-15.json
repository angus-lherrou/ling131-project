have the computer technology we have today\nAnd that makes us exceptional moon landing even more remarkable my guest ... directed the new movie first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to them or\nI'm sharing is played by Ryan Gosling who also start in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed to do one the best director Oscar for that film he also wrote and directed whiplash\nLet's start with a scene from first man astronaut Neil Armstrong Mike Collins and Buzz Aldrin played by car raced all seated together at a table at a press conference in July Nineteen sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon Neil\nIf it does turn out you'll go down in history will cut us off do you have about that one I thought it to a guy suppose that flight successful we're planning on that flight means successful uh [noise] I I just know how you feel about being a part of history\nI think I can show some light here is the responsibility [noise] but it's exciting to be the first in my wife is excited to keep slipping [noise] jewelry and it might be bigger [noise]\nPlanning on things ... and the numbers\nSure what what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything [noise] a better choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about at an astronaut and space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's the incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the magic terrain at least two\n\n\nThis is fresh air weekend I'm Terry ... he wrote and directed whiplash in love and and he directed the new film first manned staring Ryan Gosling is Neil Armstrong the astronaut who commanded the ... the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon\nOn July twenty Nineteen sixty nine I'm kind of became the first human to walk on the moon\nAnd you mentioned he had the chance to talk with um Canada Armstrong who was Neil Armstrong's life they were married for thirty six years and then I'm divorced what were some things you learn from her that help you understand what\nShe and she's portrayed by Claire fillet and Lance Armstrong we're going ... during this period in the sixties and then here there's an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal and chanted had in common was visibility to put on his face and in moments of incredible upheaval\nYou know it was something in their character as sort of mid western I'm kind of ... that they had that also ... you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you're you're you're moving from place to place to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for ... you know test pilot the ex Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this last as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and almost with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way but of course that's complicated is that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know are the kind of day by day activities instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet or you know late in the Selma uh in ... her husband that you sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return\nIt made him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded in Japan since book I'm beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what the conversation actually wasn't than what the dinner table conversation actually was a lot\nAnd from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his sons saying like I might not make it that like she demanded that he has to do and that she wasn't going to do it he has yet\nAnd he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nThat really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know it is in real life it through a certain extent with someone who\nI think it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and fly into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep gnawing fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think as a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah that and yet so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like\nIf I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing on your point of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you know\nWas a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal and some of the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know ah who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for\nThat actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and sort of cause most to uh you know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called Luna Rhapsody [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nDefinitely interrupting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by my guest Damien ... who also directed la la la land and\nWhere did you and also wrote and directed whiplash diminishes Oh thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our show congratulations on the bank you so nice to be back thanks for having me Damien ... directed the new movie first man and\nWin an Oscar for directing la la land\n[noise]\n\nMy next guest is Adam Cohen the son of Leonard Cohen when Leonard Cohen died two years ago at the age of eighty two he\nLeft behind many unpublished writings of his unpublished homes lyrics notebook injuries and drawings are collected in the new book the flame Adam Cohen wrote the forward and I'm also produce the album is father recorded shortly before his death called you won a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold in Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal in Nineteen Seventy two and I'm going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen is lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair and crash into beauty and his knowledge of broken ness lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism ended doubt\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne sullen Marianne famous blue raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of San I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed San hallelujah\n\n[noise] this is fresh air weekend I'm Terry Gross back with Adam Cohen a songwriter singer who's the son of Leonard Cohen Adam has written a forward to a new collection of its late father's previously unpublished lyrics poems notebook injuries and drawings it's called the flame\nAdam also produced a final album his father released before his death\nCalled you want to darker\nLeonard Cohen was there a week and in pain when he recorded it\nIs their son you remember\n'em from your childhood\nThat sticks in your mind a song that meant a lot to you maybe even a song you remember your father writing\nI mean when I was really young\nI remember him composing hallelujah\nYou remember had writing it oh yeah no I remember him being your took um twelve years [laughter]\nI see you know started it started when I was very very young at your versus I think they're eighty four verses to that song I remember coming down to the kitchen table and he was there was no one string guitar in his underwear\nAnd they would always be versus to consult and I remember even being invited to sing I'm\nWith a group of people in New York City when he was recording the song for his own ... which by the way Sony to time didn't want to put out ...\nIsn't that amazing an amazing turn of events to have this man's popularity have has grown you know he lived in a kind of iconic anonymity she by those two to buy that unlikely union\nAnd um two grown in popularity so much at the end of his life and for to get back to question for me to\nSet undecided the stage you know watching my old man at five years old and all the way up to ... to my forties um the whole canon of his work is just living inside of me is playing in my head is triggered by conversation\nNo there were eighty four ... versus I don't think he ever recorded all eighty four but did it take twelve years and eighty four versus before he considered it completed because of dissatisfaction with the versus that he'd previously written or because there's still so much you wanted to say in the format of that song\nAs the popular a poem states of calm is never finished but rather abandoned [laughter]\nDo you think he was frustrated working on it for so long or that it was satisfying\nI think frustration\nWas expected um ... the success of being able to let it go was was the unexpected you know I think as I said he was very vocational from the early stage she would wake up earlier than anybody you knew to black and pages\nAnd uh and gave up an enormous amount for what he would for referred to as compromised norms amount\nOr go back to that song came so far for beauty left so much behind my patience and my family my master piece on signed\n[noise] you know you call it that you know some people subscribe to the to the philosophy first thought desk thought and that's often attributed to a one of the beat writers but that your father believed last thought best thought [laughter] yeah he he edited and I'll take it he edited his songs a lot he went through a lot of traffic\nIt was a constant process of filtration and refined for certain\nSo why why don't we hear hallelujah your father's version sure\nThis is Leonard yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know in my family is that right you got to meet with ... yeah refrain please refrain from playing ...\nBecause I think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know where's the beef give some other songs that chance to get played um it was it was partly joke and partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has an hello yeah I think I think will play in any way you okay with that oh God yeah I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay there to\n[noise]\nHow was\nOr\nReally care\nMusic [noise]\nAre like oh\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThat's ... singing hallelujah and my guess is when it comes to an atom cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion mislead published Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called the flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people have recorded hallelujah and uh\nUntil Jack Buckley recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded at ... which is just so strange but um it's a sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father's genius wasn't fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just ... a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did he'd been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten by um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nOr he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied was either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself that would that ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover [noise] um\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm more than most delightful people anyone ever came across and um it wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you had this\nShabby little life and his only solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know this is a unexpected\nAbility to fill the twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world these reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the he was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and ah [noise]\nTo see him take his hat off you know and sank the jubilant audiences one after the other was to see a man who was genuinely surprised and delighted by the reception that he thought he was never going to get in a life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and see things a larger\nAnd he ended it with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family is enjoying a family isn't to those of you who live alone\nEnjoying a solitude and I thought like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say such a lovely way of sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone in July your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find your in your solitude yeah and so I mean a lot of things that actually the the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful", "show_name": "Fresh Air Weekend", "year":
