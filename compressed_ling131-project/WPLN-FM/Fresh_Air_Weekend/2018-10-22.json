Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central is now showing the first season\nThe series satirized as Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement bow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics\nBow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of bull jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] Nineteen eighty seven situation comedy or something around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities Lee agrees trace three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America went on to air for nine seasons the star of horses around ... to our guest ... ... it is good to be here Charlie [laughter]\nRecipe I'll buy Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter] ... where he later you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode one the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who was such a mess and all of Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose or play the ... by ... is our our straight person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nFor sure but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry is so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of likes linked back into the limelight\nAnd we wanted to satirized that and then over the course of the last year\nIt started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving I don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new\nUm so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this\nThing that's been happening for years and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nAnd miss defies me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not\nYou know we see a a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation are there are reports that Garrison Keillor and and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork with those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guest is ... the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated satirical series bull jak horsemen we'll talk more after a break and Justin channel reviews

Bob Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak horsemen it's\nA satire about Hollywood success or failure depression addiction and the human condition in general although many of the characters are not human they're attacking animals with human characteristics season five is currently on Netflix and season one is now being shown on Comedy Central\nSo you said that you regret some of the jokes from the first season and some of the ways bow jacks bad behavior like sleeping with his co stars I'm being drunk all the time ah being mean to people you just kind of regret turning some of those things in two jokes can you talk about that a little bit\nSure well I you know I think regret is maybe a strong word and I I don't know um what a better word would be like you go with regret and it's it's not necessarily that we had bow jak doing these things um because I think it is part of the character and I do think that we have\nFully investigated these actions and I think we've taken great pains to try not to glamorize who Bo jak gives 'em but I I think I have a firmer understanding of the power of narrative and the power of humor I think in the in the context of the show we were making in the context of\nAnimated shows in general are at the time when the show came out and also just TV shows about let's say bad dudes or you know dirt bags I think there is a a kind of joke\nWord feels like you're like holding someone to task but really you're playing it is like kind of cute are funny\nAnd I don't know if we always landed on the right line of that but I think there are moments in season one where maybe it feels like we're not just letting him off the hook but kind of taking his perspective on things right so if he says a sexist thing or if he dismisses somebody\nThe obvious joke is not oh he's a bore and he shouldn't be saying that it almost feels like we're saying oh isn't it\nWeb streaming is made possible by Lipscomb universities online degree offerings designed for ambitious learners students can earn a bachelors or masters degree yet their pace wherever they are learn more at Lipscomb dot edu slash on line\nOut of meeting too and I think there are a lot of comedy writers and I I Would include myself on those who sometimes think we have a better handle on what we're saying then we actually do and there was a kind of comedy that I think you could call\nIronic sexism or post racism or yes our character is saying this thing but we you know the voice of the show don't agree with that\nAnd I think that distinction as maybe more slippery then people will allow themselves to believe I don't know if you have the control over that that you think you do about how that goes out into the world and how people internalize that humor um you know I I grew up uh in the era of South Park\nAnd I think South Park is a brilliant show and there's so much that they do well and I there they've made me think about a lot of things in New ways um\nBut I they also have a lot of jokes about Jews and I remember being in middle school and high school and people like making jokes about me that they got from South park\nAnd obviously if you ask Matt in trade they would say well Carmen is not a role model if you're not supposed to think he's like cool or funny or charming but I think middle school or high school me who is the butter those jokes would say well what's the difference you know what what does that\nMean to me and I think I Am\nAlso guilty of of of making jokes like that in the mouth of Bo jak or some of our other characters and not always thinking about what are the longer ramifications of this on our culture\nIs there an example you can give of that of a joke that you may be regret or was she had placed differently in it can actually\nI can give a couple of examples you know I I think a big one which I feel very comfortable talking about is a lot of the Jewish jokes we have had throughout the show and it's something that I myself as a Jew feel some ownership of and feel comfortable with and there's a lot of Holocaust jokes\nAnd I think maybe I believed in season one and two that we were passed anti Semitism and I think now I look around the world and I think that was naive on my part and I think we are not\nAs passed it as I had convinced myself that we were and thought that we were and now some of those jokes in the early seasons just hit me a little differently um another joke about somebody that I Am not as we have a joke in season to 'em and bow jak is a very boorish character\nAnd we had a a gag or he's going on this press tour and everyone's worried that he's going to say something offensive and\nThey're going to Alaska and he has a line or about what we're going to Alaska what am I going to say that it's going to send a bunch of inbred Eskimo barber monsters is the line\nAnd you know on paper I can defend that joke and I can say no the joke of that is not on the Alaskans it's about how stupid bow jak as and now he doesn't realize including the the way it's set up as oh he is saying this offensive thing\nAnd not even knowing that it's offensive so I feel like technically we are in the right on this joke\nBecause Gwen one one of the prizes we were giving away this past spring of Fifteen hundred dollar American Express gift card\nAll I did was pay for a

Jared J. 'cause Oscar in his official author name as a tribute to his late grandfather who is named Joseph\nJak has asked the welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award\nOh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] so did you\nKnow out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nThroughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget they called me into the living room and I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go on another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to\nAnd my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these ... and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward [noise]\nUm you know as I get older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share that story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kidding must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising you as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean it may be turned my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are they'll I'm an adult and I really liked that I I Would recommend this to adults but um why did you want to like targeted to young adults\n[noise] well you know I've made a career out of writing illustrating books for young people you know I picture books I I have graphic novels for for the middle grade reader middle grade as you know seven to eleven years old\nAnd I knew I always wanted to share the story visually um based on the intensity of the subject matter and my grandmother salty language alone I knew this needed to be for an older audience um and I've always been obsessed with a coming of age stories about that moment in a person's life where they decide\nWho they want to be or the world is you know projects them out into the ones that you with us okay and this is my path\nAnd for me that really was my senior year of high school so many things were happening I'm obviously one gets their license that's a that's a big game changer I met my father for the first time things came to head with my mother ah and I was leaving the home\nThat I grew up in to pursue my dream Soviet art college uh so it seemed like a natural for me to tell that perspective from that Seventeen year old self\nThe story is told the perspective of the the Seventeen year old Jared and you know it's funny I didn't really think of it as a quote unquote you know grown up book\nBut really are a lot of grown ups have been reading it and responding to it and identifying with it because you know addiction touches so so many of us are either directly or just we're just one degree away from it it seems\nSo are the details about your mother that you felt were to let setting to put in a book for young people\nI've been working on this book in one way or another since the early early to thousands and every time I Would sit down to write it\nI Would stop and hesitate because I Would I Would worry to myself well why don't people kind of thing and at first it was what are the people in the book going to think you know if I'm writing about them and um\nAnd I was shopping hesitate and then as my career grew in I became known as the the lunch lady guy I have a series of graphic novels but a lunch lady who fights ... ...\nI thought wow this is writing a book on the subject matter going to be in such contrast to that [noise] those happy books that I Would be putting my career on the line [noise] um\n... as I traveled the country and I met more and more and more young people who are dealing with this I realized that this was sort of a responsibility for me to write this book I mean you know to go with a theme of comic books with with a great power becomes great responsibility now I have this audience of these kids who grew up with my books\nAnd I feel like I owe it to these readers to to put myself out there and I realize that if I if I was going to write memoir I had to just write it without any inhibition and I I wrote down the expression and I'll I'll censor this for the radio but I said right like you don't give an ass\nAnd not that I don't care about the craft but I Can't worry about negative opinions you know I have to just write this and put it out there so there are some things I learned about my mother later on in life\nUm but I couldn't give some of that knowledge to that Seventeen year old protagonist because that would have really affected his relationship with his mother and uh but there there is one particular scene a because I did have to explain\nHow really how my mother fully went away you know what would take this woman away from her two year old almost three year old son\nAnd this is something I learned as an adult and I was able to find a way to share that in the story but not give that knowledge to the protagonist\nAnd when I was when I was a toddler she was in a very abusive relationship and her boyfriend at the time came home and he and his colleagues had a drug deal gone bad and they'd murdered somebody\nAnd ah my my mother help them clean up and dispose of the evidence and and that's a big reason why she went away\nDuring that time how much are heading that would have been seen as a child\nWas upsetting to me as an adult him and I learned about it right before the birth of my first child and so I kind of\nYou know what let me just mentally shove that [laughter] if I can focus on being a dad to the human being but I don't know how to take care of and then um some years later you know when I was really digging in researching this book I realize narrative Lee\nHave to explain to the readers fully why she's going the way for so long um\nYou know you don't go away that long for for shoplifting at the mall\nOr or for stealing batteries from a convenience store\nUm and I'll tell you like you might be the ... six or seven person I've ever so the outlaw how to Terry and I share that for those young readers out there who are dealing with heady issues at home so it took a long time for me to gain that courage to make this book\nNow I really understand why your grandparents insisted on getting legal custody of you because they were afraid you'd become a word of the state\nThat's exactly it that's exactly it and they were and they also afraid I Would get hurt\nAnd what's interesting too is for it for\nYou know I have a daughter and she's she's nine she'll be ten soon and and ... has been this sort of the forbidden fruit in our house I'm just really want it to read it I was wondering about that yeah yeah and so you know imagine okay here here's your family history too you know child ah\nSo I sat down with her and I explained to her a lot of the aspects of this book before she would read it and and also made sure she read it before the book was published so a classmate didn't come in and say oh I Know this about your family and she didn't\nAnd so he is so intuitive and she has such a big heart when she heard the story she immediately said well she probably went along with it because she was maybe afraid that she would get murdered or maybe they would murder you as a baby as well\n[noise] well [noise] ... you know what one of the stories you tell in the book is that when you started living with your grandparents",
