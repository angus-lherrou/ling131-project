the Julia Child a war and when we last left her her when they were telling us about the first years of their seminal LA restaurant city cafe\nFor the French food which we in the parking lot because he didn't have enough [noise] and then how they got is we've figured as nice fight for Susan would take a trip that would change both they're [noise] they're going back to keep up to hear it again [noise] after\nAbout two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages\nThat she was going to take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of\nLike a fake fight to a race thing we were racing to see who could bona leg of lamb quicker and that's how it's worked out which I think I Want and she didn't win because well I like through my arm up in the air is in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon in my finger\nSo I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go and so then there was me and Jose Luis and we were looking at everything for those two weeks ago she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nShe was gung ho to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did the core is like little vegetable fritter as we did a puente a pancake we made doll and curry and did a shot navy and right and\nIt was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian thing [laughter]\nYeah so that and and I had been so inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting 'cause he's all vegetarian ... it was the place where I I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were you know not allowed in the main little kitchen they're basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath the but all the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different bread and it was so\nInspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later Mary Sue took her first trip she didn't cut me right before she laugh\n[laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand and had a very similar experience yeah\nMy uncle was there and he landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it had a big very very authentic type buffet and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years before that\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing\nAnd so then you know that our menu them became had cats to lay and then ... hurry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know ... and so it was\nVery mixed like that and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah and then I you know we were we this is how soon and I kind of work together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let them go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think well let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that Reagan Tony became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all\n[laughter] and literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other is free she comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement but now\nI mean when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find and but if we'd go to the market and do something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how to use it with this chili that\nI remember we discovered Chipotle eat chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what it should probably was more or less a chain of restaurants it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue ended in a dishwasher\nBut then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever it was at that time whatever minimum wage yeah\nAnd I said OK if there he came to work for his name was ... and we loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents in their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around where we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu\nAnd literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... as we couldn't remember what they even were you know called and so we were constantly looking at our notebook but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nWow you know I keep thinking about the timeframe of this was in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference and I think ... maybe they're probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant that they went through your with their family and their favorite Mexican place so they went to an office all the stuff was built into so many American pilots as they're growing up no right\nYou know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was and food that was influence from cities all around the world and we put a ton dory of and in and we got that ... from a owner of a Indian\nA hotel he was in India and then we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just\nRock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd well we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bump so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours\nWhere you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our arm in there because you had to keep\nBrushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it and we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before are opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and walls\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non and you can't even looked like a dirty side is kind of out of the oven [laughter]\nWell interestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right and we didn't know what that meant you know an opening it was just completely seat of the ...\nOut of money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so we had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we open the doors and we were flooded with you [laughter] and we were the only two people who knew how to cook\nThe food off and that very first night are ... you know we had to go through all getting the approval of the time do you have an because no one even know how to give it approval we finally get it approved so\nJust a curator from the Smithsonian's National museum of American history talking about what it's like to get the stuff that goes into the museum's\nCollection stick around [noise]

of the child award and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I Want to know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's it like standing in front of someone who's going through stuff and you know they're thinking\nAbout ... I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nFor ever [laughter]\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winners to tell you the truth and um you know for ... and it was something that uh we talked about\nAnd then it led from one thing to another um for Rick bail us it was also very different and I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot a head of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list\nI pretty much knew that there were certain things that ah stood out to\nUm ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he is an artist and these menu or works of art and show both of course the menu items but also his women see as well as photographs and documents and a few kitchen tools\nFrom Rick bail us ah we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico and then I Will have an days\nThey are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico\nAnd the field notes are handwritten and then midway through\nThey are typed and he realized that he really wanted to type as notes halfway through the trips we bought a little typewriter\nAnd he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance dividing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see where really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise] um this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with Mary Sue militant and Susan senator about there\nDon't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are how they got into\nThe restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges\nAnd how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know that's catnip to really get it and I'm looking at that\nAnd they had a pretty good sense of you know what we were after and had come up with some great material for what is it what is it their donors are different from which is yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes I ride a few weeks ago\nAnd in one box was Mary Sue ... nice bag um that she her act\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did in ... eleven and you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged\nThere are six knives for the bachelor was chopsticks scissors Lester is all this stuff is very very cool and what about Susan Susan ...\nYes well the two of them have also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and\nThese are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful and they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and uh so we have um a nice iced eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a chef's coat um you know Mary Sue ensues and\nWe're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat I'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm which again shows how they're very cognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle\nOn which is wonderful [noise] um and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then their paper and\nFor us there were these little notebooks that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up when you look at that and then you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the color your roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants\nSelf little no books like that\nNeither one from India and for Thailand for cool and you'd have to ... where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurants in Los Angeles yeah that's so cool too because I imagine\nOr Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and the you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you send me the tax texting yourself than are enrolled tortilla [laughter] but let me out there when you're also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat like as you said someone's life story through\nThe objects that they've held and written in\nIsn't an emotional process for them\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it and and talking to them about it\nYou know that the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about\nAnd there are these emotional moments when somebody will you know have that look on their face", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
