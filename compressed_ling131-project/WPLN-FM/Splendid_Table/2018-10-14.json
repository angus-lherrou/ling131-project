pilgrimage in India to cook for regardless and we'll hear about an iconic writer who mused on both feasting and faster but let's get to desert first\nDown down down [noise]\nWhen I was in ... school Fifteen Years ago I knew a woman named Stella choose a pastry chef in the making and really didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point [noise] I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me\nI'm shrewd kindness\nWell she graduated not long after and we fell out of touch with eight years later we found each other on the Internet\nYou become extra chef but even more she'd be done writing\nQuirky terrific blog\nAnd eventually got more and more into writing about science and history of desserts getting inspired by how classic cookies and take some pies and putting were made in the past\nAnd then re imagined those recipes for the president [noise]\nAnd just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook Braveheart debut on the New York times so\nA ... thanks so much for joining us examined me [noise]\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's iconic\nAmerican desserts so what makes a desert iconic American\nI really wanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had her on the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realize pretty quickly that you know outside of the house not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and that that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that so I didn't want to be a collection of\nRegional deserts are desserts that are important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that connect us together\nCoast to coast ... so how did you decide what books qualified maybe it's kind of like that um classic a quote about porn that you'll\nKnow when you see it but you kind of have this instinct right like I mean from the yellow cake Betty Crocker and I can Heinz have ensure that yellow cake is something that all Americans had a chance to try and love and we all know white cake is we all know chocolate chip cookies are and so [noise]\nYes ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and\nIts tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd tell me about this pilgrimage ... what are these women doing [noise] it's\nA pilgrimage where millions of women\nTraveled to one city to cook a dish together\nAnd that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and our travelling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and\nThe the trains are filled with women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride and and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that it's filled with all of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around or adding to the temple or adding to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our and makeshift heart of three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and he set up all over the city so they're going to how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million and ... while\nYes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the\nThat they refer to her as I should call armor um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such a mythology around all of this at this is what's so ...\nNation of a female deity usually known as ... and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift harvests with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nThe morning that this happens and women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um\nThey dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hardest that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the ... and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moment all around the city there are speakers that out women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking\nSo which actually really incredible about this is this now you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like Vern rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise] [noise]\nAnd they're really cooking so tell us when it's a rice porridge yes\nSo they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water\nThey wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony is at the ... must boil over to satisfy the goddess so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over the sort of steamy what's beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nUm they add all of these seasonings and sweet flavors and it\nDepends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol um many women at gender there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always um what's called ... which is an honor find plump sugar and\nUh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf\nAnd they wait for priests to come around this can take hours and sort of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap\nAnd then when the priest comes they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots\nAnd then they're free to you and this moment is so beautiful because it's the thing that I've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take his wounds will they taste each other's tongues Ala they feed each other and then they put them in\n... minutes late such a beautiful sorry thank you for coming in\n[noise]\n\n\nLiterally Paris so it's a contributing editor at the very

writers at the last half century uh there were many incarnations of patients gray\nShe was born in West sorry in the south of England grew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics\nAt a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage owned by her mother\nOr through to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and\nTook up a career as a translator editor and writer eventually publishing her first ...

F. K. Fisher who have far greater notoriety or than patients does and patience wrote about\nA food and uh ideas into food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways it's surprising that she hasn't better known you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from a weed I changed our life ... and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nFirst cookbook ... it was published in the Nineteen fifties it was extremely influential in England uh what was it like\n... was a remarkable book and as you say it was a runaway best seller published in Nineteen fifty seven\nAnd one of the first mass market paperbacks of its kind penguin\nUp until that point I hadn't done a lot of of cookbooks at all or let alone\nCookbooks aimed at a um a mass market audience and the book covered a wide range of European cuisine and it was mostly based on the country if that patient centered coauthor promotes boy had traveled to before the war ended in body the same kind of\nMy pleasure Sally thank you [noise] Bridget Lancaster executive editor for new media television and radio at America's Test kitchen find the recipe for we can do is Boston from ... at Flynn [noise]\nTell me oh I get to take your calls and leader more for your sweet tooth agree to Sufi\nCandy on earth Pope Francis lamb and this is the splendid table for ... pm American public media\nAnd the next on being something completely different to lightening rod figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum in actual conversation\nIf you want to persuade someone else and you have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nSally cone and Erick Erickson together with me in Montana I'm Christian join us this afternoon at three o'clock again tonight at eleven\n\nThe jungles will solve [noise] to borders much ...

talking food up your phone one eight hundred five to seven five five to [noise]\nAnd we asked for non the plant cute like when\nI went on our you very well may call your friend says please do thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant one it permeates our entire house as we have speakers and all the rooms and we've we've listened to you so much and so so often that a year like my brother and you've been you've been here at home\nWith us in Ecuador [laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come back with her one day 'cause it's a credibly beautiful but uh what should we talk about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live in a very hot place or do we get ... like ... or like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it's it's very hot and humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much for the soul mates preservation but just to keep it dry [noise]\nAnd uh and so we we really are are very careful with ah we don't have a store things and one day we were having a party and a friend came that friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge\nPiece of prosciutto a huge chunk like three pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... it's just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk [noise] and so in in the midst of the party my wife says why should we cut the what we should just put it in the freezer for now ... put it in the freezer\nAnd it's been there and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we ... because we cannot possibly eat\nThree pounds of prosciutto before which spoiled and I totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing how it'd be speaking to my ... pulled it out of the other ... is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there's no [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen per se you know I see this is an\nInteresting problem I Am honored that you would trust me with it I Hope it will fail you I have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant frozen block appreciate them before that's not\nThat many in their dreams of ... in some ways a blessing problem now have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if you're one of my questions to\nYou know if you've ... meets and things of that nature and I'm In an industrial freezers that can work because it freeze so\nUm stay pretty small they just like ... and then they're they're they're in their home freezer because it takes a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell walls and so you may find the elite some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be acquaintance um for more you know sort of to some as it was before or maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you have a deadly force yourself you know a deli nearby may consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo little slice and thin\nYou know package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage that said the other thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful textures when it was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but something about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably was it was to process it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways we're maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around something and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to\nDo some vegetables it'd be beautiful with green beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a\nSalty cured ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like silky thin sliced a state\n[noise] you know I assume that since sliced phase of it slices over it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even\nWhy even thought maybe it was just putting the singing the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole ...\nYou know I have never done that but I is I think right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey shy and I'm\nSure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to proceed but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure\nThe texture of all the flavor of all the beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that and a smoker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be white salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing but Henri ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with its cured it aired dried\nAnd then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed thin you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze that and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks\nAnd using it you know it's a flavor an answer for vegetable dish maybe\nSauce and things like that I kind of like that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a show will change and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things you should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like sliced bacon square\nAnd as a kid I Would always fish through the entire pod looking for that thing to eat [laughter]\nSo that idea of like if you're\nCutting it in and using some of it for chunks for adding to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow can see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah or if you cut it up nice some small you can start that in a pan [noise] um you know render its fat and maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fat to the ... when they get a little bit nice and brown scramble some eggs or not and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I was just I Would like use the prosciutto with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whatever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from quite a few\nBucks thanks so much for taking time to put actually we have enough
