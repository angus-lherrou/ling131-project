I Believe the wild greens\nAbout the community rituals hog slaughter and how even the seasons have their own season just how the absolute best fried chicken is made once a year when the chickens are just not enough when spring become some it's a book that's about paying attention and getting close to the earth\nAnd it inspired Alice Waters you know the queen of eating local to wash and wants told me that she didn't really know that America how could you can get\nOut of [noise] until she read and they'll do so much Lewis help change the image of southern food helped launch the farm to table movement and she did it by writing about a tiny place in central grudging\nShe wrote it wasn't really a town\nWas just a little village but by her grandparents as soon as they came out\nThere was a place where they live full of grace and\nCame out in the senior as roots like Alex Haley and all of that book was making America look at the pain of slavery ms Lewis is writing said\nShe will remain for ourselves [noise]\nMs Lewis died in two thousand six but her life and her work is still inspired us to dedicate this hour to her talking to people who are inspired by her people cook with her people who live with her and loose with the chefs an author\nA farmer an activist to first we'll start just with her as a person\nThat's we're not we're joined by her knees Nino Williams the bank\nHany that's great to have you [noise]\nTruthfully it was kind of the inspiration for our approach for the show using different voices and he'd showing a sliver of what she meant to\nSarah Franklin is a writer and educator was the person behind them\nHe's our I think so much for coming in today it's a pleasure France\nSo I Am really interested\nIn how you got interested in the work of and the Lewis I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her on straight but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand each when the editors publish entire\nIssue to voted to the American south and they felt that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written ... what's called why does southern and in this essay on this flu is positioned at the culture of the American south and the culture the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside of music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who was interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of ... and I never heard of that and I'm Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I I had no idea how she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was so I ordered some for books and I read them and sell in love with her and it was many years later that I was\nOwens who in the editor that also published Julia Child in modern ... um I ... caught in Rhode Island and yes the diary of Anne Frank famous ... leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about his work it became apparent to me that her book that she did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that sort of snap to attention and pay attention moment in in Judith Jones as career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity yeah what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans south and then the perspective of home cook\nAnd then it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat and and you need to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it in that when when you say that came late\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another ... but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history and the American south and it's a really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture\nMhm [noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I didn't pick up before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of country cooking as being more with political work what you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as or just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds likeable hurt her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm if they were freed slaves at once that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you'd imagine a story that was one of hardship and\nYou know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society at the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us mhm if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started after all that's right and that's upper finally political thing it's\nCorrective I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that the\nIn that large regional culture large series of regional cultures that was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included down she you know if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms in the forest and this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nYeah ... they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fearlessness to it too I think it's so\nAgain maybe subtle maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you walk the dogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nJust really incredible image of and they take the bladders out when they blow the butter up like balloons and hide them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later and can you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally ... and but also I remember reading it and the way she describes\nThe hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described in the hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a lightning but an asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all to ...\nUm the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly um I don't know if you wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unsafe lynching and her prose you know that that there was incredible ... missing much present to do with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nAnd and that she was going to say it's sort of quietly and many people in New hurting her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than needed to be sad and sometimes she said nothing at all\nBut if she was going to open her mouth or put pen to paper it was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from her intrudes on and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find both yeah paradox and that and I think they're in life her brilliance\nYeah incredible incredible life thank you so much there been my pleasure of France I\nSarah Franklin the editor of the Lewis at the table with an American average\nTeacher's food writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis his legendary editor\n... ...\nUm\n[noise] one of the Lewis deepest friendships was with another ... Scott Peterson the bonded over a commitment to southern food they wrote a cookbook together\nFor the last years of her life lived together so after talking to a lot to people about ms loses reach in the world we also wanted to know what it was like to be standing next to her in the kitchen\nScott Free to talk with you a great to talk with you Frances than this is so fun to get to speak with you

into her grave stone so no one disputes that honor but\nIt didn't make us think [noise] and she grew up with such a particular version of southern cuisine in central Virginia and we wanted to know more about that region [noise] so he called on the corner historian Jessica Harris to fill us and [noise]\nHe Jessica it's\nLovely to be back for him [laughter]\nSo I Want to start actually um by referencing a story which you probably know but there's a story where William Faulkner walked into the restaurant where an uh Lewis was the chef at the time in New York City\nCaffeine Nicholson and he ate her chocolate souffle\nAnd then asked her if she had learned to cook in Paris and actually miss and the sister roof told me no she learned to make a souffle from our mother\nSo especially if you missed hadn't his mother right here's this woman who was the daughter of an enslaved men who is making these exquisitely French souffle home\nSo really let me think like can you tell us about the black food a central Virginia back then 'cause that's not I think what a lot of people would have expected\n[noise] well I think there were variety of things to remember I don't necessarily know what
