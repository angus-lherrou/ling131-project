I've ever had in my life\nSo definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of our snow in the kitchen and we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier it's not just this overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make of vinegar ... either two two one two or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma individually gr by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking processed it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines uh it it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that is actually about ah the balance in harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with the ... says well oh absolute\nAnd vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano ah certainly is kind of like what Irish ... bread is a you know using that as a ...\nWhat are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize\nPart of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example of vinegar is unique to certain places and how they get\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar and have some kind of a city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar and holidays and most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving in Italy I just got back from a trip out in the mail you remind me a region where ... is king\nAn awesome it's another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball semi vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies a such a small amount is made that a lot of people having even experienced it so seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that it's\nBarely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes ministers from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd makes these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I only really experienced you know ... ... con rice vinegars the things you buy an supermarkets\nBut when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor\nAre dependent on what kind of rice they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional Raisman or coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of rice vinegars in Japan but then there's the suit this red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... or ... vinegar but what some of the elements maybe some more scientific elements that give vinegars they're distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid in solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wind there are all these volatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is often the sensation before it's a flavor\nSo you said on your palette you you have that feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little\nWhen the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but the thing that it initially does is open up your palate to be able to experience those flavors\nIf anyone is going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to be you tell a wife [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get started\nWell first you need a good juice I'm vinegar is made from any starch that can convert into sugar that can turn into an alcohol and then eventually become vinegar or see the guy said\nSlower and now they're very light very easy very fast and they work very well there are also connected to why fight and Bluetooth though the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks for a few hundred way which he put on foods or sometimes starts circulating by somebody\n[laughter] thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is

could find is always on Facebook or Twitter or pick up that phone one eight hundred five three seven five to five to we want to know what you're cooking picky about what to do it [noise]\nWe are as Amanda on the line from Decatur, Georgia in Bend Oregon good how are you I'm well thank you what would you like to talk about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend filed challenged youthful liquor is that right there and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me well I think a little ... at the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the Fraser and fat because it can make\nSomething with them a problem with I don't know what to make with them um I experimented a little bit I made chicken legs look right there I made some ... that's really all I Know how to do and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know age I guess\nSo you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal cast iron brains are about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably watching ... pretty large\nOh big you know we got a big oh yeah oh cool\nAnd then you have some cats aren't cookouts which was like ... a bit of little mini ranges right and how big are those are some way shape or and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say\nThey're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because\nI'm a I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more than ... um so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for like a breakfast ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake\nThey're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation um but you're twelve or fourteen ... they were talking because that is a really fun ... appointment to have [noise] I think from that\nGeneral what I think that kind of pot does really well so what I think his beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are like you say is a cast iron so it holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action in there which you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature\nAnd so what that means to me is if your searing say you know short ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you are raised chicken and you want to see the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like heartier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but I don't feel like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a more intense or like a deep first year is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good year on all four sides of a short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame but you know just really get that's the er nice in deep into the cuts does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that be ended up ... like I said it it kind of stealing or breathing are no longer not smart see it more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome them though is once you get that really nice dark seer them what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that hadn't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you said this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid off but an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a write in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter]\nOh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us for that\nSort of like well enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let us know goes was Louis you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nWe have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more are done say um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do\nIs cut some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher heat because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still zucchini and zucchini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so what I Would suggest it's divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time and get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want\nTossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do not until you get all you can you talk [noise] All right so a little while ago we asked you all for\nYour secret ingredients let us know what are the things that you use a you know we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her hair and how are you\nA ... I'm good how are you I'm well thank you so what is your secret ingredients\nSo my secret ingredient is a new mommy powder [noise] um or is ... and ... and ... mushrooms and that are pulverized like a very fine\nPowder um and I've used it on things you know for a big chicken for example the typical things like burgers and meatloaf I recently did on the savory oatmeal that was phenomenal\nOh cool where do you buy this\nNo I've made it I can tell you the recipe if you'd like [laughter] yeah oh about six tablespoons of Benita flakes and then an ounce each of ... mushrooms and ...", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
