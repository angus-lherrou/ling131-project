have your long\nEverybody yes lots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was the September unemployment report it was a good no hundred thirty four thousand new jobs and you're only fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there and then merger further or perhaps farther afield I never get them right Jeff rebel writes for the Washington both Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\nHey Ken Hi Neal it's jobs the euro and that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the jobs report was actually a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but people should be happy with it wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for that right at wages wages were in the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained for us in a way it is a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was that enough to spark some concern in the market\nThat this spillover to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tighten more aggressively than previously and test\nGrow up with enough uh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rate and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA a China is still out there uh we have a store president ah who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a a dynamic and strong and growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play out\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friends punishing farmers and manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built on\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place a plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of ... there are that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric suggesting that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good long the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists at which she put on your ah ... and a poet back for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what Katherine was talking about this idea that\nWe are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what this negotiation process taught us is that even something that should have been a sure thing\nWhich is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened\nTook a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward but a\nChina also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets chaired the continuation of NAFTA or some kind of knew named as rose that smells a sweet [laughter] um it's hard to translate a U.S flow when in North America\nWith a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power in terms of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right in the middle of\nTo have some great launched a slow when that's a great well um okay look let me let me turn to the news today because we have to acknowledge it Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine that she was in fact you to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nJoe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know mother Tuesday I Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody's economic agenda because there are things that have to get done right there are budget to have to get on there are\nSocial programs and and a foreign bills and all of that stuff still has to be done ... thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things where the French there\nAlways very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budgets through for example that Congress has to manage our and and the presidency as well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis\nAnd the fact that we have so much political dysfunction suggest that we are in store for a lot of policy dysfunction and when I have talked with people who are around\nFor the last crisis at ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's going to happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusions that may not be a popular ones\nKnew it to you quickly please sure and I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you want to call it that it's occurring at a time where we have really strong economic health\nUh a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are benefiting where things in wage grounds\nAh what happens when the economy naturally turns as part of a natural business cycle well that's when the government plays a raw and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then okay that\nMueller Richardson at ah we're Jones Catherine Rampell to Washington Post thanks you too\nThank you I have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of economic play right now especially in light of the jobs numbers this morning which\nAs you've heard but unemployment in this economy at a level not seen since Nineteen sixty nine year old that in with what's been going in this week in the bond markets and I talked about that yesterday good economic numbers pushing yields that his interest rates higher\nAnd it gets me to this a comment from Chris Lowe he's the chief economist at MIT and financial he's also a friday regular on the marketplace morning report which in most markets\nWas preempted this morning for shall we say other news anyway Chris pointed out to David Brancaccio this morning\nThat Chris works on a bond trading floor and the people in the bond markets\nThey've got a long long memories\nPeople are really nervous they teach sixty nine is remembered as the beginning of the big ... the lead to Nineteen seventies inflation and particularly the older guys out there they don't take their shoes at all and music but\nYou know what it would I like to remind them as the other thing that happened in the seventies who should oil\nIncrease in price from three dollars to forty you know be the equivalent of ah oil costing four hundred dollars a barrel in ten years that might be a little inflationary to\nYeah just a bit west Texas intermediate by the way Seventy four dollars thirty four cents a barrel today that was ... to comment that if you're in financial from the marketplace morning report this morning I felt that one's deserved to be heard to the broader point that Chris was making of stocks

restrict legal immigration and make it as hard as possible as a deterrent for companies and and people to use the process that exists\nJustin ... with the society for human resources management says this is not the best time to be making work visas more difficult\nThere's more open jobs right now in America was looking for jobs so employers are really looking for the talent they need wherever they're from so visas immigration is obviously required in that situation and in many cases\nUs immigration officials declined to be interviewed for this story but said in a press release back in

focus on the age when babies have with of course never intended to replace us workers\nThere appears as a policy analyst with the migration Policy Institute\nBut it may not be the best way to go about it in all of these policy changes the Trump Administration is making life more difficult not only for four and consulting company is that might be replacing us workers but they're also making it more difficult for legitimate and players that are just trying to hire the best and brightest\nThe changes to immigration policy rolled out over the past year and a half or not the end of one of the new
