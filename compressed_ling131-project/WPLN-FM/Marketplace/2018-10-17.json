I go by Chris I'm from Anaheim and I'm thirty five ...\nCorn Jessica I'm forty years old and I live in Houston, Texas\nSusan Boyle I'm fifty eight years young I reside in Anna Maria Florida keep\nMaking them and I am sixty years old and I live in Everett, Washington\nI defined financial security I Would describe financial security measures security natural security\nAs having more than enough money and resources to do whatever I Need to hire a\nRoof over your head food on the table and I'm getting medical care this innate\nYou should have at least thirty to forty percent more than your expenses are among\nThe fund set outside like savings which can cover your expenses for six months and then also legs plan for your time mentoring and education for your kids you know being\nFinancially secure would be like a seven digit number my savings account\n\nTo be prepared for another recession I feel that probably three to six months worth of a salary would feel safe\nYeah I I think I personally how the six months of saving so I'm not much worried about that\nDepends on how severe the recession might be I feel like I'm both of our jobs or\nJobs that won't disappear\nI think that we do okay um I Would I Would hope so you plan for the worst and hope for the best we have always um built a Christian and always tried to pay down debt\nI feel somewhat ... parents because I recognized that my security is in my own hands\nSo that means growing my own food cat means having good relationships with my neighbors that means knowing how to create ... or ... or what is edible\nLandscaping we own a condo we're still paying on still paying two car payments student loans and we still get by but we're not being able to put a whole lot away for retirement\nIt doesn't take too much to go through your savings that I had like if you don't have income you know so that's why like keeping that steady flow of income you know by keeping the job is very necessary you know\nThat's a real concern is like are we going to have to work to or Seventy five [noise]\nIt would just take one hospital stay to ruin us\nHealth care as it happens is this country's top economic concerns twenty eight percent of people said it is the economic issue that worries them some of\nYour slice and dice are pulled out of yourself that marketplace dot org on Wall street today miles a little slice and dice does well down three hundred down the down and then up and then down again whether details when we do know\nWhat other thing we learned in our poll is that the majority of Americans and this was across party won a majority of Americans say we are in a trade war they're not especially worried about it just four percent say traded their top economic concern\nBut on the theory that nobody knows which way the current us Chinese trade relationship shall we say is going to go what might get more people more worried\nAbout one way things could get nastier is if China started showing off some of the American debt that adults do marketplaces trees Yemen looks at the likelihood that might happen\nThe U.S government spends more each year then it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back\nIn two thousand seven we are now dependent upon China and how do you get ... on your banker thing is China's stockpile of treasury bonds is a very small fraction of the total us debt about five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan\nI think the notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries it hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years to the question is really with China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon and the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think\nPossible given the fact that the trade war is\nMore pointed then I think people initially expected\nBut selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount meaning losses for China a fire sale means that ... will be low wing will at UC Davis thinks China would have to be provoked to resort to that it's unlikely that the Chinese would use these option\nUnless they reached by some of the\nActions which ... short term as bond prices fall they yields or interest rate the market demands would increase that would raise borrowing costs on lots of types of loans Brad sat there with the council on Foreign Relations says that only reserved to the rescue\nThe Federal Reserve has all the tools needed to limit the damage that China could cause through sales\nThe fed can tweak its plans to raise interest rates in order to offset any fallout from China's bond sales\nThat's why I Am much more worried about the rest of China might conclude that just was weaker currency and try to uh respond to terrorists in that way\nThat they're says allowing the Chinese currency to appreciate against the dollar would make its goods cheaper globally and that would be much more disruptive and much harder for us to counteract I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nIt in a day\nGot it All right so we're
