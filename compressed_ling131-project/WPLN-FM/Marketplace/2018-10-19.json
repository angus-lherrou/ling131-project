President Trump announced that he was going to be providing twelve billion dollars in aid to farmers that are hurt by the trade war which hopefully will help boost up a sort of his core constituents sore centrally we're subsidizing a trade war perhaps to help her in the Republican Party in the germs and\nI'm not who knows who knows right before we sat down here to tell an ounce and it was going to have lay off so Ford has already announced they're going to do laugh so old now have the Americans\nBut wait a second because when the president says this on the stump all the time the economy's doing great unemployment low we got corporate profits this week when it from the banks which are making ... billions of dollars what smoke below like\nWell except for some one time charges and those tax benefits than benefit from the tax cut\nActually their balance sheets are looking pretty shabby which means that the regular business of lending to Americans who can afford to pay back those loans is not doing so hot which is an indicator that um maybe things aren't going as well as\nA as people are saying wage growth continues to be pretty slow\nUm and it also indicate that probably over the next quarter if they don't have those one time charges were going to see a much ugly quarter and the stock market is probably going to react pretty badly to the Joe uh enjoy the fun while it lasts ...\nOn the market thing was I don't want to go too far to this but it's interesting the volatility that has come back in the last like what two weeks now the ... and we haven't seen the river and longtime\n[noise] yes uh and it's really interesting because that the president has taken a lot of credit when we've seen surges in the market he has blamed his predecessors when we have seen depths\nUm I don't really I I and I think a lot of people a lot of economists and fight financial and business experts would agree that the market sorry the stock markets are not particularly good indicator up some of the economy overall but we're definitely going into the midterms anytime we do see a surge we are going to see I'm the president probably promote a you know promote what he's done over the past year\nAnd these are mad at falls like a thousand points to the ...

Hi I'm Jennifer ... for marketplace [noise]\nIt's been a couple of good a couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out Facebook needed that content to users court filing this week sheds new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walking to the program\nThanks for having me to go back a couple of years ago April to thousands sixteen ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook and journalism to does what\n[laughter] journalism give it to what that basically\nAnd they say listen we have to be in the space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nRight so I mean I think for publisher and this was kind of a second costs fallacy they've already invested a lot of resources in Facebook ads they see face but kind of eating into traffic\nSo Facebook's has represented video it's kind of like a thing where Facebook says jumping publisher I say OK how high and they invest all these resources into doing video\nAnd then in twenty six twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate right or even higher video producer is how this happened to places like ah\nMTV News and having to block it as Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the reason is germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said we were ... were these video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from this lawsuit this week not only were they less impressive then thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers what this lawsuit basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up to nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were saying with as many of you accounts [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go round here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe aren't getting their own homework and art keeping tabs on the number is as close as they should have been a teams like publishers are a little bit Katulis they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the newsroom people were laid off organizations were changed and or I'm Sorry to use this word pivoted um because of what Facebook should do\nI mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media dire straight and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing that Facebook is doing and they think that this could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped to ... what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims and the lawsuit right now\nRight next to him when he was discovered these kind of first uh emerge publicly but I mean Facebook is kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matter is still pending in court and everybody's going to have their day absolutely Microsoft is jak writer at a manager might official thank you [noise]\n\n\nJust followed on the way out today in which I Am sorry to be the ones that have to tell you but you don't stand a chance I mean yes somebody is going to win but\nThe odds are overwhelming that it ain't going to be you\nOr me she for that matter the official odds of one
