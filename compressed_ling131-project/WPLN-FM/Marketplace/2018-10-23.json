living no matter their crop there's always the weather to deal with nevermind hurricanes and the southeast this time of year Florence and Michael did a whole lot of damage past couple of months\nNow do you consider the crop but also trade policy and you'll discover the tobacco farmers in North Carolina or in a gym fewer people in the United states are smoking of course the most of the tobacco crop is marketed overseas especially China\nBut because this is the way trade wars works China has put American tobacco products on its tariffs lists marketplaces into your has that story\nTripled the farms covers about eight hundred acres in Johnson county North Carolina about forty five miles southeast of Raleigh rate in Baton is one of the owners he's thirty two and runs the form of his dad and his uncle\nThey farmed corn and wheat and soy beans but he says their cash crop is tobacco and right now he's stuck without a whole lot of farming to do\nNormally around the middle to the end of October we would be wrapping up harvest but unfortunately that that was a bit earlier this year the tobacco that we had in the field was destroyed and forest came through\nBen says Johnson county got about Eighteen Inches of rain in three days and the roots were washed out\nTobacco leaves are harvested annually three or four times a year in the last harvest in October renders the highest quality tobacco for baton that harvest pays the bills Florence guaranteed he'll be out bad money but he says sales were already down because of President Trump's trade war with China\nLast year North Carolina exporting more than a hundred and fifty million dollars in leaf tobacco to China making China\nOld in April the Chinese raise the tariff on American tobacco from ten percent to thirty five\nNinety percent of what we grow as for export and not only this year we face and possibly reduce sales and reduce market process because of the Chinese terrorists were also looking at potential contract cuts for next year\nBecause of this year's crop can't be sold that will remain on the shelf until it's gone and batten says he'll be unlikely to find a contract with cigarette companies for next year's crop if that's the case Larry ... is the president of the north Carolina Farm Bureau\nChina's our largest export was our largest export customer for tobacco they're more smokers in China that we've got population here in the United states\nChina makes up a third of all cigarette consumption in the world these days and it's domestic smoking continue to dwindle tobacco farmers in North Carolina have to look to international markets to fill the gap wouldn't says he doesn't think the Trump Administration knows what these terrorists are doing to tobacco farmers\nTobacco was easy targets doesn't have many friends in Washington but for our farmers here in North Carolina it was devastating granted\nBaton is the sixth generation and his family to farm says it then his blood but he's got a young son and twins on the way so he's struggling to decide whether farming is still a viable way of life\nI did want to foreign because I Love it I have a passion for it but at the end of the day I Can't do it for free because I have to support my family too and it is definitely a struggle when something is always on my mind\nHe says if he does keep farming he'll consider changing what he plans to better reflect market shifts\nTobacco is our cash crop but you know way of talking about other things he is obviously on the horizon you know what the new farm bill it could become technically legalize so that you could grow yeah I think that's an exciting new potential market\nBut changing what you farm isn't something folks in North Carolina I can do immediately tomboy he says some politicians understand that he's a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S trade negotiator\nWhat's hard about this current trading environment of course is that China is a big market for North Carolina farmers and this change has come suddenly for them\nAnd the effects of the trade war likely won't disappear as abruptly as they've emerged says calling Carter he's a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California Davis if\nThe U.S annoys China and China responds they will not come back overnight\nBecause he says China can go
