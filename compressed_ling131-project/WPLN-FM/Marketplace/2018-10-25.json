panels and dishwashers from China and other countries to be sure and then it was steel and aluminum also China and other countries\nNow those thanks to the Trump administration's focus on Beijing is taxing fully half of everything that we buy from China all of that has led to retaliatory tariffs on China and other countries on our exports agriculture mostly\nThe whole thing happened so fast you might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior in interaction which should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust before this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization\nAnd then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing begin requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust is broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how NYU business process I ruined sooner origin says the U.S interest is\nBonds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and pose a terrorist the U.S is best responses to see whether they're going to tax your

only way I Love a distinguished wash only way that\nHe came up with something called the national equilibrium which suggests that a trade war of self interest is actually the norm in that cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing to address is the ... equilibrium of the game\nTo sooner origin this means a trade war could go on a while it's been ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupting said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China it together and create space for trust his Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nDo it's giving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd to provide political cover for D.C as well someone else made me do this but she agrees with sooner origin that sudden outbreak of trust is not imminent and that this trade war as game theory suggests\nCould go on a while
