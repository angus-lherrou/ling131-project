were\nOnce a case that has seen both ads that thirty three year old Oscar night is a computer scientist and bilingual he says the Spanish ads seems to take a different tack with the elder Cruz talking about the opportunities America gave him as a refugee and the American dream\nYeah you can definitely see the complete difference right so there is no talk about here's this policy here is this a

values\nShe worries that Spanish only voters will be left in the dark if these ads only play on emotion and talk less about economic growth taxes or health care\nIf you designed Spanish language ads that are meant much more policy content in English language ad then Spanish speaking voters are not getting the same kind of information that monolingual English language from\nAlmost a third of all eligible voters in Texas and California are Hispanic and their numbers are growing in many states across the country many of those households big predominantly Spanish the Democratic party did spend some cash this week to galvanize the Spanish speaking vote but overall is spending on Spanish language ads going through the roof\nYou answer that question is not really\nThat's Armando ... he runs in LA marketing for use to help craft TV ads in Spanish for Republican candidates he says we won't have a clear picture of exactly how much has been spent on Spanish ads until after the midterms we do

tipping point\nWhere a large part of the electorate every single year but we're still political parties still under invested that outrage\nIn Texas Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz's democratic challenger also has ads\nIn English and Spanish he's fluent in Spanish the recording one more and just requires another take nothing really heavy investment the real cost of both campaigns goes into figuring out where to place those at Yale University political science professor Alex ... recently published a study on the effectiveness of ads in Spanish\nThe major costs and this is why I think we don't see more candidates and doing it is if you hit a monolingual English only person with the Spanish version they react extremely negatively\nHe said that could be that English only speakers tend to bristle

three to five years that work time and says as long as banks had money to lend\nBut when the great depression hits people began to pull their money and there was a financing crisis in Nineteen thirty
