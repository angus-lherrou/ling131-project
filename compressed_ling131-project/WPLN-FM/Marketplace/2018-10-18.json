increase over the prior year that was on Monday and then yesterday\nPresident Trump said he wants to cut five percent from the federal budget next fiscal year instead of majority leader Mitch McConnell said he is disturbed by the deficit and blames Social Security and Medicare\nBut here's a big chunk of the increase in what we're going to do every year is because the federal government is
