resolve the twenty sixth day of October good as always have your long everybody the number\nOf the day this Friday is three and a half percent that's how much the economy grew in the summer quarter July through September much\nBecause you knew there was going to be a bunch of numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be one Neal Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody Hi chi chi chi\nSearch out and let me start with you uh and and uh in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a tree sheesh emotion in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts in it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the the ... to ... capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the tax man's and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNeal it occurs to me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nUh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking and that's good as Katherine Ted because the consumer is good\nI I hear some trepidation do when you're ...\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three persisting concerns\nSlower global growth higher interest rates and terrorists in trade tension concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and said you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears later point them out will will ah [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to billions of dollars into the United states because of all these are not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says ... we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I just want to say\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been so like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he signed the terrorists don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that could make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business groups when I've talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMueller do the right I'm from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed or ... or his biggest or economic problem I'm even as a German bell told me back in June even as the fed doesn't bring attention with President says one does wonder if\nYou know with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about ... what does this kind of ... due to the motive ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what the fed is really concerned about is how they keep the economic bull market running how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be aware and eventually the next recession hits he wants to make sure that he just took it as a fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero right so\nAlong that path any political ... political ...\nSeen rate makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for poor Miller Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink he ... thanks guys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to end it up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while since things have felt this chopping rent will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\nMm [noise]\nHard\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine Neal and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you can start to separate what his boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nThat the embassy now is chief us economist at ... ...\nWhat you saw with exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shapes nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth\nBut he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter cars than now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax or farmed for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher still prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nAt least at that country and company level consumers just start feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research poll fifty two percent said terrorists had no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nYeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explained to me how this works\nIn the old school sometimes just about the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you know when you need long term archival storage you want something separated from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's very it's it's reliable and at stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah it's terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes that's about Fifteen million bucks on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there's a corporate store you're right there's it Sony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin it inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed a complaint that the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nTo catch them courses that if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it to back up basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT see saying please don't shut eyes of the mount a we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan there so there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's just an army that shuts down operations ...\nGive me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent it seems on backing up basically the entire Internet on on\nJust two companies trip that that seems like a challenge it it is\nThe hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and to put ever more stuff on these tapes so if only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bugs it's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWhile she's ... she's the ... a correspondent at a Bloomberg students I fought proceeds from\nFrom the American pet products association comes to shut up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets will disclosure part of that came from me about six billion of uh do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us\nTo the point to a series we do called my economy how people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here you go\nMy name's ...
