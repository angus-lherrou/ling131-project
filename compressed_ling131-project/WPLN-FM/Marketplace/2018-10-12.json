I'm sure there's still a lot that needs to be ironed out and there are plenty of investors plenty folks running companies are worried about how all this is going to shake out in the in shall we talk to me than about why everybody was surprised because\nComing and yet the past two days everybody just went oh my God that's\nThe big mystery I mean everything that has made markets go crazy this week has been with us for so long I mean markets just completely shut off the trade war right in August\nAnd all this other stuff interest rates deficit\nEverything and I think part of it is\nWe know that this is going on for a really long time everyone is thinking you know there are we to complacent and I think that that's just you know does the market know something that the economy doesn't know which happens sometimes with you know I I think the fears are and found it I think when we see\nNetflix and Amazon come out with our ... in the next couple of weeks I think I you know who knows but I Would think that\nThere is there going back on everybody's going to go yeah I feel better yeah for now\nI'm a David the president's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow made one of his many parents is on the White House driveway yesterday said look the kind of economic fundamentals are strong we've got gross going on and yet on maybe Monday or Tuesday I forget the international Monetary Fund came out and said\nHold the phone trade war terrorists were going to take our picks for global growth down a couple of nachos so there is little disconnect there\nYeah I mean front and center here spend the U.S economy has been the Chinese economy as well all these global bankers economists are gathered in Bali for this big concept there ... all this stuff out of a right to reduce the forecast for us growth and fraternities frozen in two thousand Nineteen um I think you're seeing that contrast that again we've seen for these many months now that you have\nWell respected economists saying they're going to be risks to what's happening here in you have members of some inspiration downplaying those risks it's interesting to the division between those advisors to the president and president self we were talking about Jay Powell just a moment to go to the fed chair you had the present earlier this week\nCasting doubt even answered reporters' question does he planned to fire Jay Powell I didn't know that we've gotten there yet this is a guy that he picked 'em so you have a president now watching these interest rates rise fair to say no president wants to see interest rates go up um but there exists still this division between the president those were about\nTo leave that point about uh the president Polk and Jay Powell in the ... told me on this program I don't care what the president says I'm going to do my job but but there is something about um why it matters that presidents attacked ... never happen but but this is real now\nIt really is and right he hasn't done this before and Jay Powell has actually managed to be relatively out of the limelight since the since he took over\n'em but you know who knows I mean this could be here one day and on the next I mean we just don't know I'm writing interest rates you know it's a good sign this is only good thing it doesn't need to be you know it it doesn't need to be such a bad thing it's not crazy\n[laughter] it's like you totally predictable do in the sense that this president has hitched his wagging to the store the markets from from day one\nYou've now scene of a sizable downturn in the market this week and he's looking for an excuse someone to blame for that that seems entirely predictable unto itself as well he's somebody who does that often right so ... percent whatever it is\nUh he's looking for somebody to blame this week I think it was ...\nAnd we should point out here that the markets are back to where they were on or near not all that long ago I should have looked out the number of where I came in here but this is normal and to be expected and arguably a healthy thing in any market rally\nAnd you know it's a time and time again it's your monitor here the doubts about the economy the cockpit
