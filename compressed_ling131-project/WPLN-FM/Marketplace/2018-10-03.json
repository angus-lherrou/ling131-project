relatives value partners says this concept matters to individuals to he says sometimes clients want to keep money in cash rather than risk losing it\nAnd talking about the merits of investing versus

he wasn't specific and the times story doesn't mention it the writer did adjust all their numbers for inflation expressing them in what's known as today's dollars but that's a different concept and

we had it over to the headquarters of J. P. Morgan Chase security guy medicine took us up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um people understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were a kid I sometimes people are saying\nThings as a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage you have a checking account you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that they understand don't understand the inner workings of the bank doesn't matter what does to me but I don't I don't think it should matter to the customer now with the customer wants to do a good experience and you know good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but doesn't matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think it I think it matters to understand how business in general works\nSo if you don't have the financial system you don't have an economy so defense is just part of this great economy in America has the widest deepest most transparent financing Margaret the world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital\nThe formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country the world has it it's not even close this kind of it's kind of a part of the engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we just come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis or a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI think the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you're sick you're poor and so I I think people should understand that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me in their financial crisis\nYou know which of Christ I suppose the card that happens every seven to ten years\nI wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things that makes me cautious as knowing all that I always always always wanted to run the bank\nThat we can survive anything show that were there in good times and bad times and ... more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a second as I said I I Want to talk for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer yeah talk about that a little bit\nI've always I've I've never believed it only seems to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nCompanies wait so sorry how how come everybody thinks all companies just wanna maximize should I say it just\nBecomes a narrative it gets repeated over and over companies have to do a very good job over an extended period of time to get customers back or companies that take care of customers succeed if they rip off customers they don't\nA I Would still dealing with by the way if in fact we were the ... G afterwards hundreds of mortgage brokers went bankrupt so yeah it's it was ... I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us knew all so many places I forgot number and how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California or we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now to avoid something like that happening again\nYeah you should never be satisfied and I think I'm more explained that ...\nThe regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap\nI give you just do leeman redux it wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty being a capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity than most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah what happened to me and it was a disorderly unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse 'cause they had to sell assets\nThat was all stacked so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still certain my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut not always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking severe regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening away from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politicians and then stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expected so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like China's it can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking\nBad outcomes you jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but the funny back you up for me\nOn the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headlines ... jobs GDP all of that good stuff but as you said are on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems\nYeah so the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait I'm not that I mean I I I Want to it but the good in the back yard so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities and why is the capital markets\nAnd yes income inequality is a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it the economy's been going in Munich early and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the architects of the American public that everything we talk about their or fixes for we put our minds to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it off\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said at the at the un across town a couple of days ago it is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had more of a cat or Mexico's Eighteen forty eight Mexico's accident quite well and we treat them very respectfully but you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish\nYeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade was so what do you see that's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish does it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into\nThat look we advise the president that while you're young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day the president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method work I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems\nSo she'll put on your your most objective Jamie diamond self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy\nYou I don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of ... eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy in there a lot of other big banks still a lot of I I'm going to be could be one of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than a market value this somebody's trying things make more money than we do they have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they should they're fine they are Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also have to compete one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I Want Jake more chase me the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would I think it'd be a mistake for America the best things in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks\nWell so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr gets the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big yes\nBecause remember scale economy is not true for banks is true for auto companies are true for law industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is the client's it it's not the company because capitalism forces to return to the company ...\nA seat it's why we had no issues through the storm [noise] there was a whole lot more to
