John ... the pro rock climbing pro free use of the breed the brain is brave enough to keep paying travel the world\nInclined harder in most things I write\nIn two thousand north space sponsored the four of them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\n[noise]\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year\nHad a ... ... they got a destination yes [noise]\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely start but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank and not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this law get get across the river\nCame over and I was reaching out my hand in trying to grab his hand in place\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's if I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me his rifle and I was like wow that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy\nAnd smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like the triumphant moment and they like having among the sub shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood\nWas that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and praying and mind our business but there is this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy he liked to themselves president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all go in and go to this other place and then his boss was getting it on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my prayers were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some way or the specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice\nWhat you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of their captors bear split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night than rested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we took guesses and it turns out that had been five minutes and I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey didn't have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape\nBecause he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to you guys as Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nAnd do one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as gardening and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set as weird way where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously mess that he had bombed the story that I had to spend a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him Denali served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing ham and begging him to not go he he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew let's do up the mountain now it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there's just as ball of excitement\nAnd there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted a scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and hanging in the knife and you remove like all of that and you leave flight one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified and there's sort of trend especially the sun\nAnd so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with ... and\nThe top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this\nYou think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we should do and believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is a chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and we're raising up the\nClass and it just so scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his guts drop the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I pulled as hard as I could and he just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in like an eternity looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact and the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAlways knew that he had medical issues and then obviously it has to brand surgeries um those really traumatic for me I think I was fourteen at the time to do something like that from\nThis is huge brother Spencer and well stewardess stiff or brittle Spencer is known by everyone and his family to be all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on pedaling on my head down to really like ... French revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you kinda you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd then too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old since you started getting headache to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with now formation in his brain\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mal promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer in Studio ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but ... didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery it could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when you became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about I says about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nUh just knock that coming out of surgery as we're totally different person I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person center was scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that and sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are from it made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure you want to help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nOoh expressing my regrets about my own surgeries because I still have some some even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime\nTo some surgery is just not in my surgeries and it's not it's made me a somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm\n[noise] so and I get a little fish will suck all with you there's some try [laughter] okay um so in like Julie ... story with any of the first to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's intimate by our brain or something less physical and I wonder if that's\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all I'm nursing somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to their since he was having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent she was just talking about or jeopardy rush and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend turns hospital room in the U.S you [noise] to feed them in a coma in\nA condition that I Hope I only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nGoing to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should ever happen to make\nOne snap judgment override episode continues stay to [noise]\n\nRead him a doesn't think elections are good for democracy is fundamentally flawed and I'm not sure if they could be fixed his idea replace politicians with randomly selected citizens\nIt works when people do this people make trusted those decisions hacking the law that's next time on the Ted radio hour from NPR Saturday afternoon it too\n\nIs this song at National Public radio our podcasts tell stories about your

to snap judgment override episode when it was in Washington\nAnd we left off young men Spencer he lay unconscious in the hospital because all the melt formation in his brain in all the family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nAnd you had to strip and while he lay in the hospital bed she dated his family his mom ... had to decide what to do a play they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons namely Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now than they would the one to five percent chance it's been to have another strip and that chance would increase every year of his life but the surgery he was posing with a very risky\nWith Dr Kim with explaining these very daunting odds any recording it because she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nYou know it was it had some risk associated with it\nAbout five to ten percent chance of a major complication from the surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um\nI Know that the surgery before the ... [noise]\nI think that does the situation is dramatic changes and really what we know now with all that you know what he wanted to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys then is to make that determination nobody in the world knows him better than review so um so it's not what you want or what I Want to write or what mom or dad now\nWhat would you want and that's where we're at [noise]\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a typical fee but I could I'd heard of a brand new nursery yes that'll gave him at the cabinet by me but at the desk contract which should have done multiple although I Know there's risk for is not a theoretical risks are real risk it if it happened all those particular surgery\nSwitch from John in that area what was the outcome will get a ... percent of home five to ten percent of them have a bad outcome\nOne that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy tried to convince herself that you can figure out if he's going to have a complication now and you can just keep going around in circles wondering like well maybe [laughter]", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
