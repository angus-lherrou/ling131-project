completely suck but also get the get the log across the river and then get safely onto the other riverbank and not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this law get get across the\nAnd ... over and I was reaching out my hand in trying to grab his hand employ them up in the rock and he was terrified of rocking\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection not just by a white is even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle on I turn around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind holding this for a\nMinute and I think that's probably when John frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed Abdul hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like Penn and I'm On the shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in\nOn the rebellion and his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they praying and mind our business\nBut there is this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion and\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time [noise] there was a communist leaning dictator type\nFigure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was getting it on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then when we're all going to go home\nThe captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John Day you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take\nMatters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our chapters as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murder somebody I very much\nSaw them as victims of circumstances somewhere to specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there and saying you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make\nWas right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and ... and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and just by his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker Iraq and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of their captors ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three\nDays starving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his\nBroken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes and I I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape\nBecause he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kinda weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously mess that he has bombed the story that I've spent a week selling to learn just bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in begged him to know [noise] good served pleading with him not to go\nGet dangerous out there there are soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to not go he he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew let's do up the mountain now it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode there\nIs just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy has got to guns and the anger named the knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night\nWeb streaming is made possible by states in ... a full service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at ... dot com\nI Know it's kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nWhen you can tell they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge wouldn't bat\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe\nMorally in killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and we're raising up the class\nAnd it just so scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab it God's job but you sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me close to him I reached out I grabbed his gun strap and I pulled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting to spark through them in like an eternity and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let out of this really horrible are cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off in the darkness and\nI always knew that you know medical issues and then obviously to branch surgeries and I was really traumatic for me I because [noise] fourteen at the time to do something like that [noise]\nThis is due to brother Spencer and while stewardess stairs or brittle Spencer is known by everyone and his family to be all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to like work ahead cringe revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you kinda you know you had a sense of joy and you're just like wind down there\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with it now formation in ...\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mouth promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain situation didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery it could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when ... became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to Ken how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nI'm just not coming out of surgery as we're totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center was scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that and sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take your picture\nOr is the case of an otherwise kind and gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he was worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was all men are from it\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\nEven to help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgery is because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute there and to him the [noise] one of my biggest regrets\nAnd not [noise] it's made me a somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm\n[noise] so can I get a little physical it's optical with you there's like ... okay [noise] um so in like Julie ... story with Amy I'm been choice to\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that didn't turn out by our brain or something less physical and then when I thought so\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all I'm nursing somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to their ... it's been too having severe headache it again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent she was just talking about are you a British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched him try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIn was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see them in a coma and\nThe condition that I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\n[noise]\n\nOh I\nWant to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family she ever have to make\nOne snap judgment the override episode continue to stay to [noise]\n[noise]\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a podcast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie casts\n\nIm WNYC Studios looking back to snap judgment override episode\nWhen it was in Washington and we left off young men Spencer you lay unconscious some hospital 'cause all melt formation in his brain and all the family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nOh you've been through and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed today did his family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what to do a play they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons namely Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now than they would do one to five percent chance it's been to have another strip and that chance would increase every year of his life but the surgery he was proposing\nWith very risky with Dr Kim when explaining these very daunting odds any recording it\nBecause you could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nBut you know it was it had some risk associated with it\nAbout five to ten percent chance of major complications from surgery or a minor ... or anything in between\nI Know that my heart surgery before they pass\nIt makes it the the situation has dramatically changed in ... and then only do we know now with all that you know why he want to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys managed to make that determination nobody really knows him better than three of us so [noise] um so it's not what you want or what I Want to rent or when mom or dad has been [noise]\nWhat would you want and that's where we're at\n... have you ever performed another surgery with a difficulty rough cut I heard of the framing naturally yes that'll getting him out deep Kevin

that area what was the outcome will go to ... percent of the five to ten percent of them have a bad outcome\nThe one that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nCan you'll go crazy trying to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a conversation around and you can't you just keep going around in circles wondering like lonely [laughter]", "year": "2018",
