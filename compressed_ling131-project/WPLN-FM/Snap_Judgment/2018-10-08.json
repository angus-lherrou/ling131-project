writer in Washington DC she was at home and a weeknight and houses dark and her family was asleep\nI decided to make one more pass through my email and see what was in there if there's anything I needed to pay attention to before I went to bed and one email popped out at me because of the subject line was saving a legacy\nSo\nI started reading the email and I physically sat up writing bad I mean I've always thought it was a cliche to say someone sat bolt upright I sat bolt upright in bed and I said oh my God\nUm he just wanted his ideas to survive [noise] he left very few people\nBehind among them a daughter who he didn't raise and who he was a strange from he popped into the lives of strangers in his last few hours and then he disappeared altogether but not before asking cake out his ex wife to be sure to keep his Facebook and blog up just in case someone got curious about his work\nThat was the part that upset me the idea that he felt that\nThis was what was important in his life\nAnd nothing else mattered to the point where he was going to kill themselves because there was nothing else in his life that mattered you know I I've been very fortunate to have\nHad a fair amount of success as a writer and so perhaps it's not fair for me to see this because perhaps I Would feel differently if I weren't as successful as I've been but it would never occur to me that\nMy writing was the most important thing that I had contributed to this world\nI have another island oh a aspects of my career I'm a scholar of yet in Hebrew literature and I'll say that\nWhen you study English literature you know a whole lot about forgotten writers most of the books on my shelves were literally saved from the garbage I Am sort of very aware of what it means to be um a forgotten artist in that sense and even with all of that awareness um\n[noise] I just I was upset at the idea that what would matter most about a person's life would be their work every person has a legacy you may not know what your intact is and it may not be something that you\nCan write on your tombstone um but every person has an impact on this world [noise]\nSo anyway let's say you were successful writer and you published your books and people read them let's say you were an amazingly successful writer and people even read them after you were dead [noise] let's\nSay you're really successful and people read them a hundred years later I mean you know it's like well how far are we going here\nEventually you know they're going to find your name on a credit card in a landfill\nDarryl Cynthia
