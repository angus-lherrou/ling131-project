[noise]\n\n\n\nWould again today show up hot Jason Smith Tommy Caldwell ... John to the pro rock climbing [noise] pro the freest of the breed the brain is brave enough to keep paying\nTravel the world and climbed the hardest in most things off [noise] rock\nIn two thousand north space sponsored the for them to climb in the minds of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow [noise]\n\nThis location of terrorists than has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year\nIs using and they ... they got a destination yes [noise]\nBut he managed to\nGet himself completely soaked but also get the get the log cross the river and then get to safely onto the other riverbank and not allow the rest of us to\nSort of walk across this law get get across the river\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand in trying to grab his hand and form up with a rock and he was terrified and was rocking her this law [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like wow that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind\nHolding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like ... shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood\nWas that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they pray and in my own business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained a John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was getting get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nThey kept his plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters\nKilling somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see are actors as evil as you might even though we have seen them murder somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries\nLike I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there and saying you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but he would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throat so am I going to jump on this guy and to fight his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to far climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out that have been five minutes and I I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plants with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape\nBecause the team to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain among with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nKind of senators weird way we're like we would take to safely up just mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously man that he had fought the story that I spent a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not only served pleading with him not to go in dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ...\nHe he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up still tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew let's do up the mountain now it was for two months\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just as ball and excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and the anger name and I think we're a move like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nWhen you can tell that they were there were like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with them\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe\nMorally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and went racing up to class\nAnd it just so scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his gun struck the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in like an eternity and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front\nOf me and his whole body let out this really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nKnew that he had medical issues and then obviously you brand surgeries on those British traumatic for mayor because [noise] fourteen\nAt the time just handsome like that this is huge brother Spencer and while stewardess stairs or brittle spent you know like everyone and his family to be all hard and free spirit he loves being outdoors listen to the way he talks about mountain biking\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like crunch revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you gotta you know you had such a joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd it's been too was always happy and healthy do\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headaches and he was diagnosed with it now formation in his great\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mal formations\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain situation didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time we spend two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what [noise]\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the NATO rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nUh just knock that coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was real scared of\nA different person center was scared his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind and gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer\nSo I think for Spencer seeing\nHow I turned out and everything wasn't\nAll men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure\n\nEven if they helped me yeah\nThere was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing some of my regrets about my own dreams because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute there to him that [noise] one of my biggest regrets with the surgery as of now and my surgeries and it's not\nIt's made me a [noise] somewhat better person at times [noise]\nUm\nAnd I get a little successful it's optical with you there's like ... okay [noise] um so in like ... ... story with Amy and then she did\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so\nAnd I'm Wondering if that's ten term entire brain or something less physical and I wonder if\nMy beliefs problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly even set a goal to their ... it's been too having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent she was just talking about are the British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of as bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restarted ivy and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I thought we would lose them\nIn was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles ... got to spend ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see them [noise] in a coma in\nA condition that I hoped only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nGoing to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should never have to make\nOne snap judgment the override episode continues stay [noise]\n\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and cats or wherever podcasts are found\n\nUm WNYC Studios\nWelcome back to snap judgment over right episode\nWhen it was in Washington and we left off young men Spencer he lay unconscious some hospital 'cause all the melt formation in his brain all the family knew was that no matter what he never ever wanted to have brain surgery\nOh you've been through and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed she dated his family his mom and dad Steven ... had to decide what to do and to me they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons namely Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now they would the one to five percent chance it's been two would have another strip and that chance would increase every year the life but the surgery he was proposing\nWith very risky when Dr King when explaining these very daunting odds any recording it\nDoes she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nYou know who is it has some risk associated with it\nAbout five to ... percent chance of of the major complication from the surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um [laughter]\nI Know that the surgery before this half [noise]\nMakes it the situation is dramatically changed and knowing that we know now with all that you know what we want us to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys' dream is to make that determination nobody in the world knows him better than review so um so it's not what you want or what I Want to write or when mom or dad now\nWhat would you want and that's where we're at [noise]\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a typical fever I could I heard of the brand new naturally yes that would be covered by the ... sort of gun most although I Know that there's risk for it's not a theoretical risk gets the real risk it if it happened all those particular surgeries\nWhich are drawn to that area what was the outcome will get a ... percent of the five to ten percent of them have a bad outcome\nOne that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy trying to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a complication around and you can't you just keep going around in circles wondering like well [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
