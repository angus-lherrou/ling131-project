condemnation of political violence immediately retreated to blaming the biggest culprits\nWhat is the first statement the president makes about is the day is to attack the media you know he says a very big part of the anger we see today and our society is caused by the purposely false inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that I refer to as fake news\nHas gotten so bad and have for the beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast\nWhich blame shifting rhetoric led to charges that the president himself incited violence with his constant vilification of Democrats in the press\nSo if you see somebody getting ready to throw tomato knock that crap out of the vote you serious [noise]\nThe last few days he's been calling for a hatred toward exactly the growth and

this from Fox News\nJust doesn't necessarily mean that someone is espousing some sort of conservative ideology and targeting Democrats it could be someone who's trying to get the Democratic vote out and then curve sympathy so you can go either way\nSo I I just one final question does any of this matter or there's still many mine's not made up and of those mine's not made up or they're going to go

enormous human caravan wending its way toward the U.S Mexico border\nExcept that it was a political bonanza for the Republican Party\nAnd remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nDonald Trump characterized the exodus is a word of would be illegal immigrants about the surge over unprotected borders to take our jobs flooded communities gang activity and drugs and as a bonus harbor Middle Eastern terrorists\nAnd is now obviously trying to conflate both Middle Eastern fair and illegal immigration sort of a double racism sandwich\nWe're going to the thing of all Americans in the hands of Mexico Geraldo no never\nThat as opposed to the truth thousands of desperate people many of them women and children in fear of their lives taking advantage of safety in numbers and no need to pay parasitic coyote traffickers yet destined to wait in line for weeks or months to apply for legal political asylum\nSarah ... a freelance reporter traveling with the caravan has written for the Daily Beast about the cruel reality behind the surge of migrants not an invasion or a stun to bake Donald Trump\nBut the desperate reaction to ongoing crisis in Honduras Sarah welcome to in the media thank you for having\nNot until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nGigantic population of truckers which so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with the guy named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think that but I tell a certain stages\nAccording HIV are tell and I'm not going to the skin finding that there are other people with much smaller care that he saw intonation about it are the stuff and if I could get in touch with those organizers\nHe has a life experience and facilitate all\nImmigration and so he got in touch with them their fight it and then he said to post on these up according to tell her what happened was there isn't any change it they hatch if people and then there is this news report on hunters is nice watch cable news network called agency\nComing on dog sees when I got to be identified a reader them up by the phone up Wednesday and then when I look\nAnd they are clearly said that he would be paying for it in other costs for people\nThat are not going to me that you know they might not want to know how do you live and he said\nHe got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them ... but then all of the other factor why people like ... ... ... out in the way that it had and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credit fat positive news or part with the initial explosion\nOn a report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in\nHonduras the government wants to minimize why people are leaving they know they're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that day that is the government created this is in line with what the United States is saying\nThat there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there\nGet out there is this right wing media me it's actually\nVideo of service members\nBeing paid cash money\nAs the story is told that it's you know George Soros money or Democratic Party money ... people had northward to invade or\nBrad wants caravans they liked the garbage a lot of people say I wonder who started the German what God has been debunked tests would not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checks on it first day on a busy owned by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourists just paying anyone on the care that\nI Believe that it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed out to them and that's really not unusual considering the local support that we're seeing for migrants here in Mexico both in the town is once people get there\nAnd then along the way there's people pass out water than at a close ally now for me though yesterday and how are the migrant settled people came out and we're giving us toys underwear and all these sorts of different necessities to really seeing a groundswell of local support for this caravan\nKnow what's interesting about that trope is that its origins seemed to be the hunter and bus or to the United states\nWho sent the video footage to a Republican congressman who immediately tweeted it out in their ... caught fire so this was not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the state affairs the closest thing to be after the the United States has around ... is that it is funded by the opposition of hunter and that it is sort of a political game that people\nWithin the country are playing that sort of more the wine that I've been seeing raised in Honduras which makes sense the country's extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year where there was a razor thin election and the machines counting the votes shut down and when they came back on\nThe leader of the opponents slowly starting to slip away and the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez who had been the income that one power and so critics allege that he stole the election and it sort of through the country and to unrest thirty people died in that shuffle mostly killed by security forces\nTo the country is having grown and polarization sense so you know this sort of feeds that narrative a with a president that's frankly facing a quarter legitimacy crisis\nNor do you have to go let me ask you one last question is there one story that you've encountered who say kind of crystal ours is the situation the personal drama or the politics and the fear\nI mean you turn around and every person you I have another story that really it just makes their claims credible I met somebody the other day who said that his son was killed by getting the sun was fourteen you made it clean\nTarget preventing future and hired a pint cast on change makers and the projects championing and communities nationwide you turns hires available on apple time cats or wherever pine caster found\n\nNo no no no\nNo no no\nNo no no no no no\nNo no no\n\nNo no no\nNo\n\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield an election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle with it and the American culture wars including ...\nOn three campaign\nWhich is not contain\nAnd woman can enter a woman can knock\nThat in downtown privacy and man [noise] [noise]\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me out but see the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there\nIs no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but when we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training were able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a\nFriendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with him\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that\nConversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not that treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is and if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big\nEffect does this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely Evan asked what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy of the matter of campaigns very\nActually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so you should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials\nDifferent versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers you have to fan out in the community which is why the campaign industrial complexes built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign or twenty sixteen the beta or ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so from my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap you might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause\nThat many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation is there some way that we could find ourselves\nOn sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results and that's kind of the trap that that research on campaigns and elections and campaigns consult me has been for a hundred years what we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nYesterday had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate all their activities around it within the next year old on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that\nHe has a very persuasive and rigorous and that prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their work\nDavid thank you so much sure thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business school of Stanford University math Collette has been reporting on the question three campaign for the WNYC podcast Nancy\nMad welcome to Adrienne thanks up I'm All right so in the late summer you went up to Massachusetts and you tagged along with the door to door campaign in support of yes unquestioned three that is\nWhen did that case they looked like so it's just like super enthusiastic super grassroots organization what does the word people use
