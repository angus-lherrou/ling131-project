measures\nThat could have been written last year I'm thinking of Thomas Friedman ... piece in November titled Saudi Arabia's Arab Spring at last the crown prince has big plans for his society yeah\nThat's really the hit with this narrative is the fact that it's constantly on the brink of being that kind of enlightened reformed progressive society you know regardless of which came which monarch happens to be in power at the time they're always just aspiring towards something but just never quite seems to get there\nWhich reminds me of the headline in Nineteen sixty kinks out has increasingly assume the role of liberal champion of constitutional reform and you know that the Saudi constitution wouldn't be adopted for another thirty two years in Nineteen Ninety two\nFrom the

personal issues since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nThis war and I want to start with questions about your Native American heritage music knowledge that you listen to yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to yourself or in those directory so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not\nI have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born up until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are so my brothers are who my family\nJust kicking off a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced\nShe said because she votes where I was in ... that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity for but if you take the test of the shows you earn it here\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minute pre campaign video and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examines who DNA\nAnd the hunger genome who did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence that we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first and showed us the media and they sort of the men exotic Trump pay off the million dollar bet at all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and left appropriate accusations\nThat she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity Barney fights\n... but also a stone into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people be at actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not governed so strongly by the idea of having distant unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you are looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors but does a lot ... at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land her head of household and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men and then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments\nYou had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities and didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base real you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nYou see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I Am one thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they are pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who is your mom\nCousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the system often ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father is non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... will decide rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something much she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ...\nYou know I don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren move I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this myth of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them why do you think they do it\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that is so prominent and racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that is very racialized thinking and again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us\nBut we also have this much more powerful way of identifying that's about can ship and try them citizenship and that helps us mitigate some of the\nDNA race reparations and reconciliation after the [noise]\n\nKnow their application of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins disease on [noise] on

calling six one five seven six zero twenty turn or on line a WPN dot org\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone the double helix structure of the ... rival nucleic acid or DNA was discovered just sixty five years ago but mankind has been playing with the notion of what makes us who we are for millennia\nTwins especially played a prominent role in ancient miss allergies the founders of Rome remiss and Rami lists twin brothers raised I had giant wolf\nCaster in politics has twin brothers who's Gemini forms sparkle in the night sky the birth of twins has been interpreted as good luck and as bad and they themselves as to how ... of the lightness\nNever stopped you see it in size five saw gets like Star Trek\nWilliams was\nBelief on Star Trek next generation\nThe Southern California

mom\nAnd my issue I guess and learn learn on our brain laughing\nDouble trouble\nWhat's when partners in crime are doing\nBut beyond mere novelty multiple births can provide scientists deep insights into the age old argument between nature and nurture\nA documentary released this summer three identical strangers tells the story of triplets David Eddie and Bobby adopted by three different families and studied under highly unusual circumstances spoilers I had\nTo do these voices [noise] the parents have never been told that there were two other children what was the ... how could you know they're trying to conceal what they did from the people who did it when you play with him to do something very wrong\nTo come up with something was\nThe secret study orchestrated by psychologist Peter New power to examine how three distinct parenting styles might shape identical triplets weird apart\nNot until the boys met by chance in each Nineteen did they learn how their lives have been manipulated for a trove of data that remains largely locked away and an archive at Yale according\nTo Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal these study was likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact but nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of his adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I find that\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity once knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like not says twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space while a twin lived on earth the me had a few with this Scott\nKelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronauts in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore\nOr your faith has already made got two inches taller than a brother\nStarted found seven percent of Scott's James did not return to normal after he returns on two years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins that space\nNot ultimately and they physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent\nSomething has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other an identical twins where to part or identical twins who difference I'm white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease [noise]\nYou've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins who are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north\nSo even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary [noise]\nSo what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things\nIn terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED a high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always had to drive he didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this is a very telling case and so many ways\nSo some of the myths that you are are confronted with on a regular basis that you would like to dispel right\nNow one of them is that twins communicate ... ethically I have carefully reviewed the literature on that and published it in my book twin misconceptions I Believe\nPerform the same way and make the same choices but it's not as though they're communicating their genes simply predispose them to make these similar choices but the special language is and that's that's different when we talk about special language is this is more common in twins but can also occur between", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city":
