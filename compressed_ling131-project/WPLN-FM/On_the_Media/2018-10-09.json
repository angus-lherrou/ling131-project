November she explained several of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse Rick nor bad behavior we\nCalled on her again to identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nTo anti bandwagon fallacy it's something I kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news item curious content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerged we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were pressed memory cases in my life especially against one\nSo the question is if there's something going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that could be a bandwagon that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently is is that ... effect or technique which is a way that a lot of people who are accused respond\n... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation unloading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of the nation we saw his righteous indignation you choke his peers and if you're not a doctor for but rather on this on for confirmation

be reunited with her loved ones and our ancestors and the after world give us almost Protestant and it's and it's insistence on a kind of work ethic as it's spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought they did the dancers in the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meeting all white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presidents of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a ... of an Indian\nAnd then you had an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer she said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization\nFollow it up with one more wrong and why please on paint and I came up all creatures from the face of the year\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat almost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us and indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\nAmericans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry my heart and wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep Brown's Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee Dudley dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota was nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep around despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realize and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared it Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off of the following three to purchase a health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doing from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nAnd this is we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents rise they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nDon't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government\nDefinitely do that in Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had done a dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or this is not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering and injustice that's right\nIn Seventy three there was the takeover and the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise]\nKind of common when [noise] violence [noise] might have to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] ...\nYou say you had very complicated feelings about it\nI did a massive it showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives is as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those frogs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell\nDavid thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show\nDavid trier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of literature the University of Southern California a novelist and author of the forthcoming book the lunatic knee Native Americans from eight to nine [noise]\n\nA game of German singing and this is on the media and the media is supported by target resenting future intolerance upon cast on change makers and the projects they're checking in communities nationwide\nFuture harsh and babble on apple pie cats or wherever pine caster found\nNo no no no\nNo no [noise]\nNo no no no no no\nOh\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThis is on the media and Brooke Gladstone indigenous people stay on Monday we'll pay homage\nTo although his ancestors and homelands were trampled with colonial disregard\nThe question of who should claims solidarity with this minority seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racists far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery in an alternative for Germany moon walk him too fast and fortunately I found it\nHilarious at first it was in a tweet by one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany\nTheir tweet showed the photograph of who didn't bowl it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six and it was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon Indians who was the ...\nAnd you say that India and the thing is the odds than and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds that Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature or something of a creation myth\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources you cry these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as decode than and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen send early Nineteen century\nFrench philosophers Jones or Corso used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt but their temperament was akin to that of the noble Savage\nCentered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland which throughout\nOff of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into\nThe farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shot her hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive hunch exactly Apache Chief live to see to me the really popular factor among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] he's always out there by himself looking for white people he can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure but as some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter]\nBecause he has a character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like honesty bravery industry is nests\nThese novels had a very long life what's Hitler\nYet it is that that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to their troops\nBecause he had said reading about the issue will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the eastern from\nThe minute to was the ideal company commander buddy wasn't why\n[laughter] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also pragmatist said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not ... and profit from it [noise]\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said presenting Indian novels to German children teaches them about leadership and military training and racial ideology\nHow does it teach about race ideology\n[noise] yeah we take wrote about to come and she like and to come so not only to the famous Germanic leader arming use who defeated the Roman legions at the battle of ... forest in nine a
