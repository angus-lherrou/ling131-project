challenge China on trade but\nWe don't need China or Russia to throw sand in the gas tank of democracy because we're doing that ourselves systematically and increasingly for more than a century and we've been doing it by\nKeeping people from voting this past summer the Brennan Center for justice released a new report on voter purges it documented sixteen million voters removed from the rolls\nBetween twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen almost four million more than more removed between two thousand and six and two thousand and eight\nAnd the areas with the most dramatic calling exactly the regents that until twenty Thirteen were so historically\nThe voting rights act subjected them to pre clearance from the Justice Department\nPre cleared means that any changes that that state or that county we're going to make in their voting laws had to be okayed by the U.S department of justice or the federal courts before that change was made\nCarol Anderson is a professor of history at Emory University and author of one person no vote a voter suppression as destroying or democracy she says that the previous law the Nineteen fifty seven civil rights act had been insufficient to deal with the disenfranchisement of black voters in the south\nBy the time that the u._s. was fighting the Nazis only three percent of African American adults were registered to vote in the south\nThe state's implemented new laws new purchases and the civil rights act couldn't deal with it the voting rights act could because of pre clearance because the states could not implement a law then run elections based on disk franchise meant\nHave politicians who had been elected because of just franchise meant who are crafting new disenfranchising laws the voting rights act really short circuit it that\nThese jurisdictions had been caught red handed and were required to pass federal muster before enforcing any of these rules intended to suppress the vote which they claimed was an onerous burden and by the twenty first century no longer necessary because\nThey've cleaned up their act and in Shelby County versus holder the Supreme Court agreed with\nThe county commissioners and Shelby County Alabama and be gone and accessing vast parcels of land around Calera city\nAll of this without getting pre cleared by the department of justice so they're violating federal law there had been one lone black city councilman in ... city\nThe lone black councilman moved from a district where he was going to get elected to a district where over Seventy percent of the residents had voted against the rock Obama\nIn the next election after all of this redistricting Calera city no longer even had one black councilman\nAnd the Justice Department sued Shelby County saying it was in violation of the pre clearance requirements and the voting rights act\nAnd the U.S Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts writing an opinion of four or five four decision\nSaid that one\nRacism was no longer the kind of prevalent force that it had been that gave rise to the need for the voting rights act he pointed to black elected officials\nHispanic elected officials the increase in black voter turnout and he said so it's clear that racism is just not operating in the United states at least not at that kind of high level\nAnd he said that the voting rights act didn't take into account the changing dynamics of America\nLet's just say that the Roberts five four majority was the case of premature Rick calculation about the level of racism in the electoral process\nComes now they're burning numbers which shows that the voter purges suppressing the black vote is highest in precisely the places where the court decision let the stress ... off the hook in other words they went right back to their former practices\nYou hit it head on we had every indication of this we had Alabama in two thousand and eleven that past of voter id law now when Alabama was working on this law the Republicans recorded themselves talking\nThe black voter turnout and then all of the racism course out you're going to have all of these aborigines and these are literate getting on these hut finance buses and going to the polls\nAnd so they crafted the voter ID laws targeted at African Americans to depress the vote but that was in two thousand eleven before Shelby County beholder\nImmediately after Shelby County beholder boom Alabama begins to implement that law the same with Texas and so these states we're just poised they had these laws drafted ready to go and the purging was a key piece of it here in Georgia\nOur secretary of state Brian Kemp who is now running for governor has a program called exact match what exact match does is it says that your voter registration card\nHas to exactly match what's in the bureau of motor vehicles database say you have a driver's license or or from the Social Security office\nNow where that gets dicey is said that your name is hyphenated um Garcia Hi Mark his and you hyphenated\nWhen you write it for your voter registration card but said on your driver's license in the driver's license database\nThere's not a high and they're not having a high and\nGets you kicked out of your voter registration and your voter registration is denied\nNo it's not just purchase of the voter rolls through there's many other classic tools to voter suppression I just want to make the point that this was not some sort of new development\nIt has a long sinister sordid history in Eighteen Ninety during the rise of Jim Crow the state of Mississippi was trying to figure out how do we stop black people from voting\nAnd they devised what was called the Mississippi plant\nSuch as the poll tax where you have to pay in order to vote such as the literacy tests where you had to read sections of the constitution even the state constitution or the U.S constitution and interpret it to the liking of\nThe registrar such as the white primary we're only whites could vote in the Democratic primary\nThe grandfather clause the good character clause that was when a ray of devices that created a package of disenfranchisement targeted at the black population\nThey couldn't just say we don't want black people to vote because there was this thing called the fifteenth amendment to the constitution that said that the right to vote shall not be a bridge on account of race color or previous servitude\nAnd so they were trying to figure out then how do we eliminate most of the black voters if not all and still remain constitutional\nThat framing led to going after suicide only imposed characteristics on people\nAnd then making that the litmus test for access to the ballot box so poverty coming out of slavery African Americans were impoverished there was no forty acres of no meal that kind of poverty than played into the poll tax the significant massive under funding of black schools\nFor a while now the FCC now used to come up with a brand new regulation\nWhich takes months to write and then it has to go for public comment period which is probably another month or two and then it has to come before Congress for at least a month and so there was a long way to go and tell some clear guidelines has given on the other side the IRS has really chosen\nTo protect the donor identity is rather than to disclose their identities and this is the way they aren't they moving recently because they believe that there's too much room for error that there had the leaks of donors who did not want to be disclosed\nSo the IRS has moved away from disclosure so it's really unlikely that the government agencies or not do anything and time to make a huge difference for the midterm starting late or even in time to make a real difference next year\nAnd let's just say in some fantasy world both the federal election commission and the IRS do pass some explicit rules governing five oh one C. fours and\nSimilar category fiber once the sixes if we know anything from history it's the political money adopts\nIf you're a political high roller and rules change you know you're going to find a new way to donate if you run the show yeah he political action committee what would be your next move\nSo if I let them ... allow for a nonprofit I as a nonprofit that state to a donor could you give me some money to help flip the Senate and then I Will use your money\nIn whatever way it take to get there\nSo the cursing out changing the way that they're asking he's on his money they might be asking you generally support what I should point out to curb please give us money and then maybe they'll try to use the money for political purposes it's really unclear thoughts allowed but that's one creative way that the groups might start doing it\nAnother way that the ... and they start operating is that they might give it to unaffiliated superPAC so I have and the ... Huey nonprofit group kick the donation and then I make a donation to a superPAC and that that way to super PACs\nGave the money and the ... a nonprofit and would not have to disclose any like down I gave them money to the nonprofit so it's actually it's adding one more layer between the identity of the Donna and whatever what triggered the disclosure of that person's identity\nAlso known as money laundering\n[noise] that that's what some critics might call that I\nWouldn't aren't than objective reporter call it that\nIf there is a change in the uh the political donor ecosystem at what point do you think the status quo will change by the twenty twenty presidential election for example\nAlthough it's not officially in ... and we may not see any sort of official change in behavior for the next term it's already started altering behavior of John areas and to RIMPAC and non profit groups that I've spoken to let the donors that are looking at how they know where\nOn the possible change coming down the pike and when the lower court ruling came down in early August and actually put a lot of youth groups on alert so they have been scrambling to figure out what their bill\nCouncil what this means for their fundraising for twenty eight children what they should be telling their John or how they change the script for asking for donations and\nJohn are already asking well what does it mean for me how early can my identity the this goes to the public that's actually changed a lot of behaviors already\nLet me ask you one less thing however this plays out it still seems to me like a surprising decision by a Roberts' court Citizens United court\nTo let stand this lower court decision that complicated life for political donors can we do find anything about this situation beyond its particulars\nThere's very little could read any chip away to the Supreme Court reacted here because we don't know why that happened we don't know why they're that's because the other justices deadlocked for four on this or whether they just wanted to go through the full appeals process\nWe just have no idea what is interesting about that certainly in the context that judge Kavanaugh's nomination it shot after this case your appeal it could come back before the Supreme Court and\nIs there it adjusts if Kavanaugh who is not a fan of scientists earlier or campaign finance regulations and it's a really make a huge impact and the ... campaign finance regulations are decided on at the Supreme Court level so and how it's very interesting at the stations that are just\nLooking forward

system this week in the New Republic Rebecca ... recalls a ... story she heard a long time ago I found the right who demands that his age explain heaven and hell to him the stage replies by asking why he should explain anything to an idiot like the samurai\nThe ladder becomes so enraged in response to he draws his sword and prepares to kill\nThe stage says as the blade approaches that's held\nThe samurai pauses and realization begins to flood in the same age says back then\nBut I get there from here how short circuit the wiring that\nLeads to in bracing bought information that supports our views and the reflects of dismissal of the character and motives of those not within our own try Bob right author of\nWhy Buddhism is true the science and philosophy at meditation and lightened meant

generation any particular environment in something more like a hunter gatherer environment and that's why the crazy things like road rage that don't seem to make any sense to me rage made a little more sense in a different environment a plane\nWell in a hunter gatherer environment rage gets you to demonstrate that you cannot be taken advantage of somebody tries to your possession and make whatever you show you're willing to fight you get mad at the fight even if you lose the fight you demonstrated that there's a cost okay\nWhat do you take this out on the highway well first of all nobody was watching is are you ever going to see again there's no point demonstrating anything to them plus now you're going eighty miles an hour\nAnd the consequences could be worse and you know a lot of things things id guilt a lot of things kind of miss fire in a modern environment\nAn example of how guilty miss fires\nYou might feel you did something to somebody\nYou wonder did I feminine and you you're guilty\nBut they're not like living right next door to you won't see them around the campfire that night and and that kind of thing can fester for a long time and just go unresolved is not quite worth emailing them about and you're left we're wondering\nThat just didn't happen in the natural environment everyone you're interacting with new interacting with pretty much all the time\nSo what you've got is a an accumulation of [noise] like a haystack full of little twigs that you carry around in like a weight that are meaningless and that don't matter [noise]\nYeah well one
