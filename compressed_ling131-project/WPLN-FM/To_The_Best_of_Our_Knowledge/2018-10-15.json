are a lot of famous stories in history\nAbout poisonous plants [noise]\nSocrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell those stories not to write a field guide to poison where\nLet's just talk about wind plants have actually killed someone or been used in warfare or for some dark and various [noise]\nAny story is a mystery writer she's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with the psychic reading about wicked plants [noise]\nShe introduced Shannon Henry fiber to a few\nOh Abraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake route poisonous cows would graves on this plant the poison would make them sick but also\nGet into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human\nIt's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been lifted as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world but [laughter]\nWell I've out that I Want it to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve manned drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people and the horticulture community plant started getting offered to me kind of secretly\nLike you're actually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plans including some illegal plants\nAnd it was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I owe ... maybe you've heard of a hallucinogenic plant from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the da is very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plant but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you've started collecting collecting yes so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what the plant\nDoes to you madness or blindness I found a company that makes resident\nSkeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter] so I had all these lightly defective goals and hands and and so I had those are kind of Ohio like a skeleton buried creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical\nWas it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful\nSo I was crying Fox closed due to tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that both medicine and poison depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very\nPretty I've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have inability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I'm fascinated by this than it is something that we're finding out more about so one way that plants communicate is through route exhibits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bugs it's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's there for good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is more healthy and superior in some way but\nStrychnine as a hundred percent plant based [laughter] what a cyanide so it was a rice and they're just trying to keep from getting eaten plants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away so they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to eat them [noise]\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken mountainous town [noise]\nAnd that was shot and Henry Khyber talking with her\n\nReally fascinating

they employed hundreds of girls and young women to do this really delicate painting\nAnd the girls were told to keep their brushes shark my gently sucking them or lip pointing\nHave you know anything about radioactivity you can guess what happened next\nKate more spent years investigating the story and the result is her book radium girl\nI was ... sticks by the extraordinary true story of within five things at our rights\nAnd I was really struck us the girls all pointing putting that paint brush is between ... which was the technique they talked\nAnd you know that's one of the wing radioactive substances you were reading what by doing and you're thinking no don't do it and the same way that if you want your horror movie you you think you know the young blown heroin is she willing down not talking down and you're thinking don't do it you feel the same about these girls you described some wonderful seeing so radium\nIt's glow in the dark as we said it made the girls literally glow in China and they loved that\nThey did absolutely they themselves would not use some of the paint as makeup they put it on that leads to shut up they paint that peace with it that was what ... what you want to go in the dark I Know [laughter] [laughter]\nCatherine wolf one of the Illinois dial painted talks at how the women would wet that good to dressed as to the plant because after they finished what they'd go out in the dumps holes\nAnd the radium girls would be the one shining and shimmering with this is the ... was that flooding adult thing to the latest ... ... it's just so\nPoignant for you know for that and it was just a job loss and say they what this glamorous kind of entourage that would go as they walked through the streets of new ... New Jersey and in ... in Illinois\nWho was the first girl to die of radium poisoning and and what happened to her\nName was ... so it started in Mali in ... which was true with many dial painted she had to buy to sit with ... she went to the dentist and he extracted it\nBut then ... next to ... started to hut and then the next one she goes to the dentist absolutely desperate to some kind of help for some kind is he used to this excruciating pain that she's suffering\nAnd the dentist reaches into her mouth with his hand and gently ...\nAnd it breaks against his fingers\nAnd he is able to lift it out of her mouth and a week later he does the same to the rest of the bank in her mouth\nAnd just to explain what ... ...\nYour hips you'll falling you would drop by and and it was actually making holes in the woman's buttons say when the dog to study then they found that they honey kind on most of the ten\nAnd say well money ... was trying to treat with aspirin was ah\nYou know ... when victory having holes drilled in and Kathryn Shaw one of the radium Gulf said that the pain to ... to a dentist joining on a life of days weeks months time that's what she said the pain of being a righty and go with like\nAnd in the meantime the girls would go to the companies and the companies would say no or they say you're imagining it or you're making it up and they would they pay doctors to testify against the girls the level of the cover up as kind of hard to believe\nIt's really quite shocking as you say the the debts the depravity to which they would sing they hired private detectives to dig up dust on these women you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would beat inhumane\nThere's one I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the test results but they themselves created a list of who's going to die first\nYeah that is exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radioactive Iowa\nAnd so I saw in the ... when I was researching it's staggering black and white a list of all the women's names and a number next about name you know from one three to five I don't see how somebody could look at a woman a young woman no\nYou've got her name on a list and you know she's going to be dead in a year and look her in the face and say you're fine\nWell I I I think it just goes to show just how expendable and disposable people full of women are not time that was one funding Connecticut to settled with that girls and that one woman mills recalled who died\nAnd he's six months off the sheep and not right on the phone off the husband settlement but this time they offered him was forty three dollars and Seventy five cents oh my God less than fifty dollars for human life keep it\nOne of your favorite young women to tell us about just introduce us and yeah tell us about

was half assed job and she was there for nine\nYears she was actually fired for being sick\nShe had to lint basically because the righty and had settled in had lack and they said ... was closing tool you've given nine years of your life to a company and they fight you for being sick but they've caused a sickness\nThat was a very big mistake because what ... done it he did was that she fought back and it takes years say by the time the Illinois he went in a finding suit is the great depression\nAnd say the town than against to and the women at this believed that shown that told the lawyers and foods and sheets and by the time the case comes to cool\nPattern is incredibly sick she has a stock cutting the a ... on how the hip caused by the radio and\nAnd it's the size of a grapefruit adult to talk about how white blood cell count which should be around eight thousand on she's got few hundred teeth are falling out had Joe Biden is crumbling in her mouth she is close to death and yet

... open up all eyes even as she's getting her testimony and it's too late for her radium poisoning his faith till she no she is going to die but she does it for her friends and she does it for half time they the children for her husband\nAnd I just think that is just a shining example of what these women dead you know as you say that buddies were crumbling neighbor impoverished they were facing sudden death they grieving from the friends they lost and yet they stood up they for for that writes wow\nThey did win in the end of the Supreme Court did finally rule against the company what

was a big ... fan\nAnd you know for lots of reasons musical but also\nThe north Dakota and he was Minneapolis it was just weird connections sort of I guess being in Wisconsin shape thing but also it's like a certain kind of like northern Midwest like\nI feel like our Midwest is very different than what most of America things in the Midwest in Iowa in Kansas and stuff and this feels different you know more isolated [noise]\nSo I was like boy this was like a real serial bomber or whatever so I turn off my phone and I watch the movie and I watch the whole thing kind of vaguely thinking about prince not directly I mean I'd followed the plot but it was always sort of there [noise]\nThat would go to the movie and I turned my son back on it and I started looking at social media ... feels like

filmmaker after her argues that are digital life is on the Democratic because we handed our political and economic power over to a giant tech corporations who are making money off every post and tweet we make\nI think we need to talk about the way that these devices and these platforms in these websites are actually addictive by design every aspect of a website like Facebook has\nTested to see what gets us to engage the most so everything from the color schemes to wear buttons or place and they need to maximize our engagement to maximize their cliques because they get data from that and that's actually the business model of these\nSites they're advertising financed and so they need us to engage in to give more information into like as many things as possible because that's where the profit comes from so I think it's important to shift that to go this is not just about\nThrough her books to second self and life on the screen and in her most recent book Alone Together she explores the toll digital technology is taking on our personal relationships\nWe are living a life smacks of watching the physical and what's in the virtual and I think that's genuinely new and that can only come if you have a device with you that lets you know literally be dinner with your friends\nLooking up and looking down in a moment did your blackberry and doing something in your virtual world\nDoing something on Facebook that your life as a mixture of what you do and the real and virtual\n\nI was at a funeral people at the funeral party are are hiding their blackberries under the funeral programs they're texting\nIt didn't just happen once and it happened several times and many people have spoken to me about similar experiences they had had it's about not taking a moment\nThe times that we need to be most present to each other\nIt's not just about letting our attention wanders\nIt's about forgetting the point to the exercise which is to be with each other at the time machine in the county\n\nTo take a time to less dark was speaking to someone who was talking about a Fifteen year old birthday party\nThere's a point to this party when everybody wants to go home and part of being Fifteen and\nSuccessfully getting to be sixteen and it's that Fifteen year olds have to fight through that moment and learn to get along with each other and to make it work with each other\nBut it just Fifteen year old birthday party everybody could just you know get on their Facebook and be elsewhere\nAnd not have to deal with each other\nAnd this option to not just ignore each other but to really find\nAn active social place in the world that doesn't include each other I think that is genuinely new [noise]\n\nWe really need to think about when we need to deliberate when we need to\nJust be with each other I think the question is not turning off our technology and not getting underway this wonderful technology but it needs to be putting its place and sometimes you really just need\nTo be with each other and give each other are full attention\nAnd that's the sense that I fear that we're losing and we need to we focus on [noise]\nAm I to social scientist Sherry Turkle she's the author of Alone Together why we expect more from technology and less from each\nOther Mm coming up media there is Doug Rushkoff says technology is changing the way we think about time strength champs as to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio and ... are ex\n[noise] Mm\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI don't know about you but I feel like I can never ever no matter what I Do keep up with the endless tolerant of email and Facebook\nNot to mention Twitter Instagram Snapchat and all the rest will media theorist ... says all this technology is actually changing our relationship to time and we're all having trouble adapting to us he talked to stay possum\nDug the title of your book present shock is a reference to Alvin tougher as Nineteen Seventy book future shock what's the difference between future shock and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense maybe the the sensation might be similar the real differences that the future that Alvin tougher was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so wild tougher was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world\nThat was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able to adjust to change itself I'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century\nWe became less of a society that was just obsessed with their future and what's next in what's happening what's the next big saying where's that are going\nAnd we became a society that was very much\nIn the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected moment so our our focus really becomes less about how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living\nIn a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... were you break this idea of president to them down into five big areas in little let's talk about that was one you call did you ... what does this which\nIs interesting and it kinda comes out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou're the one going to the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice to choice rather than watching these canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment very often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line where we're choosing both that we've ended up\nWith really multiple instances multiple incarnations of our stuff\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copy so well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for a response as their view on Facebook who\nMight be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories you know so\nHow do you deal with all of these different use running simultaneously that's sort of the essence of the digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're a single person now he's going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the digital any a chapter when I was\nI kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk whether I'd be able to get from one to the other and time and each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I and I'm In this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar 'cause they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be an all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just whining and handwringing about\nThe problems of ... but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital timeframe digital technologies really don't understand time they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited\nYou know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we founded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well in the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better supposed to make it easier and it seems like it's just made to feel crazier\nRight and that's because I mean and not to get leftist on you or anything but I I really do believe it's because instead of using digital technology kind of first black which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home and our underwear anytime we want\nYou know 'cause we'll just get our work done and and turn it in as it as it's ready rather than\nGoing to work for this eight hours a day and being always on while you're there what we ended up doing instead was kind of taking that time is money a fish and sea values of the industrial age and translating them onto the digital age where digital technology really if we're going to embrace it the way
