DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the the the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers federal offices of women's health we have no offices have men's health even even though men die sooner\nIf we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nAmended [noise] ...

America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature is a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed I'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment\nI feel invested in being an American who with other Americans thinks about what this country or to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other\nWhat do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater of war that's my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very Niger and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time and are like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you\nCities mother coming out of these are very similar\nUh it is the experience of cars ... which is maybe the first definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\nThis conversations I've been talking about ... if somebody says you know gays should be and or Muslim she'd be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that's sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and New York New York is much richer\nLagos might have twenty five buildings monumental scale and New York has three hundred never ceases to surprise me flip the sheer physical scale of New York\nAnd then there's that thing in New York of being a world capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't let people in Cairo drying his Berg tell you different [laughter] you know\nIt's all live and they are dogs this is this is a very strong guy talk yeah ... that's\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold Lagos is the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what does a bolt looked like if these borders\nAre not as they are I ...\nI've loved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city which is set in New York and kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering and which is sort of I think ... some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for a bunch of these a book of wandering\nAnd what I really wanted to evoke over the course of this book was\nPsychological intensity but also a sense of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets as an incessant allowed\nA shock after the days focus and the relative tranquility as those someone had shatters the column almost silent private chapel with a layer of a TV set [noise]\nI was my way through crowds of shoppers and workers to road construction some forms of taxicab\nWalking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nAnd I was accustomed to seeing in the course of a day\nEach neighborhood of the city appear to be made of a different substance\nEach seem to have a different era pressure\nAnd different psychic way to\nThe bright lights shuttered shops\nHousing projects and luxury hotels [noise]\nThe fire escapes in city parks [noise]\nMy futile task of sorting went on to the phones began to morph into each other [noise]\nAnd assume abstract shapes [noise]\nUnrelated to the real city [noise]\nAnd only then did my hectic mind finally show some city still itself [noise]\nHad you call talking with Steve ... ... new book is called blind spot and you can see some of the photographs in it on our website\nMuch longer interview Steve did with him in the middle east [laughter] so\nWe're talking this hour about reinventing yourself getting outside boxes or writers have a word for those\nBoxes genres here's Lauren ... is a dangerous idea\nAnd learned yet is the author of broken monsters and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial argument that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is\nWesterns and crime novels and they these are all somehow different and have different values systems as far as I'm concerned we should be ... you know reading habits we should take any Dan Book we like to bed as long as that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know\nSo the idea that we have stories and we have good stories and bad stories and we have stories that use different elements\nBut to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to fit sudden criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise]\nI think we miss out on a lot of really good books and of course the bad psi phi but it also depends on what your idea of science fiction is it's a very broad church it's the same with crime you might have a really tedious little motor mystery which breaks out all the cliches about pretty dead girls and\nThe serial killer creeping up on people and we've seen it before and then you might read a crime novel like gone girl which just blows you out of the oil to\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist we need more hybrid novels we need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read make yourself happy re challenging adventurous dangerous books across different genres surprised yourself\nI was trying to sleep and you know my parents were you know jamming and um I heard this guy you know playing piano is just like a so aggravated of trying to see if I was probably about six hundred just wanted to go to school the next day and [laughter]\nAnd I've run out there and there's this guy and he's in red spandex and I'm white Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and huge afro and he just banging on the piano and I'm like\n...\nAnd it was life\n[laughter] so [laughter] do you know had I known your later I'd be idolizing has sunk mastery [laughter]\nThey're just doing who you're talking\nAbout I've read so much about your past growing up I was thinking about your biography and you're talking about people you're around people that I think are special is delayed print so who are no you were ... and and he was your mentor told me about ... about your relationship with him and the music but you were able to do with him [noise]\nYeah well that was just an awesome surprises life [laughter] um I you know growing up a huge huge prince fan and he reached out to me on line like Nico where you come to the park and play with us\nTo say yes to that one [laughter] it's pretty much a you know\nSo we went to Paisley you know that's where the big was [noise]\nAnd um yeah I don't know if I meet him I didn't know if he'd be like the wizard of Oz like behind the curtain you know whatever we were sound checking and you know we're in the Paley Park and all of his outfits that you ever remember from ever video where we're we're hanging there and I I can I say the F. word or\nSo we were told not to swear but anyhow that's obviously really hard\nFor me so I looked up and I'm like oh shit like that and I and I my eyes go down from looking at is kneeling and don't Barry is an option 'cause I just said she in front of friends but I wasn't but so I just kept saying and it was so bad um\nAnd then he was like have you ever been to Paisley before and I said no no he was like you want to come check it out oh yeah [laughter] so um I was asking him all kinds of questions and he and he is a super cool and very generous\nAnd then over the years you know we just became friends and he would bring me out on the road and um we wrote together and jammed together and watch movies and he was just very generous with advice and support and\nYeah can you please for me I just I'm sure the song is going to become a hit I I Would assume it will I ever would have played for loves your when you do your your cover of princes nothing compares to you for us because we\nThank you so [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] it\nDoesn't feel as though he\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSince you know\n...\nThen\nI can\nHave given mad\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\n\nThat's nice I post a performing nothing compares to you for the night print\nIt's on her album Nico and strings underneath and in between Charles in roe came talked with her [noise]\nI'm an strain champs it's the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio NPR acts\n...\n... ...\n...\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago we were having a staff meeting and dug Gordon said he just done an interview with Michael mess mess and the guys are on the table were like who and I said Michael Smith from the monkey\nAre you kidding me oh come on keep the peace factored image of ease [noise] get\nFor those of you not old enough to remember\nThe monkeys where there's smart funny adorable pop group in the early sixties they had the zany TV show I was a six year old super fan I watch the show every week\nAnd I still remember all their names their was Davey they're really cute one with the British accent but when everybody had a crush Mickey to second cutest\nPeter the quiet one with the blonde page boy and Michael Michael ... the one in the green stocking cap okay so the monkeys faded out sometime when I was in third grade but Michael Smith\nTurns out to have had a really interesting second and third and I now fourth career you sort of invented country rock and the music video he wrote two novels he worked in film TV and virtual reality\nAnd after all that have come out with a memoir called infinite Tuesday an autobiographical rent and lucky for you and me Doug garden sat down to talk with him\nSo Michael one of several things that I think you invented or at least help to invent is country rock and and one of the great examples of the pioneering country rocket you created as a song called listened to\n[noise] well I can try I mean listen to the ban came out of a studio I wanted to go into the studio before the monkeys was over right at the end of it\nI called filth in Jarvis who was a producer he was that was his producer but I called him up I had known him I said I'd like to bring a band in the studio\nCan you put something together what do you put together was the Muscle Shoals base that had just started to play and was completely rearranging the way people thought about our and be in the deep south gospel driven music that Aretha saying you know and so forth\nSo that was late one day going into the studio and when I walked in the door these guys have been just jamming and riffing and doing stuff on their own [noise] they said okay well here you are you're late were really good but I just heard him play these recession cats are planning to topple the form so a plate I'm listening to the band\nAnd they started playing to it in a way that was very far outside country music it was very far inside rock and roll it had opened up some of the same windows and doors\nThat the big power players were opening up the drummers and the bass player and Briggs on the piano when everything locked down\nInto this this R. and B. slow ... march of ... listen to the band\n[noise]\nIt's late into a groove\nCleaning\nLeave the man and\nOne of the things you invented quote unquote invented in I think it's fair to say well I'll let you respond was MTV music television and you tell me how you did that [noise]\nWell no I Do because I I really didn't invented I what I was there I was there at the birth of it okay and and it started with the music video I'd been asked by Chris Black well it was", "show_name": "To The Best of Our
