about her father\nMy father died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about her father's goats and how he appeared in the house to grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my mother went to assisted living and then we sold it\nKind of Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry I Would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nI took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house she remodeled it asked me if I Want to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was\nAnd she said your father's coast has them here and I looked at her like she was level [noise]\nWacko [noise] Mm [noise]\nAnd she said they were remodeling that first part of the house and this decision or a man or a figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there is a man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever there isn't a feared and she went running down the stairs

you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard Wilder stories so yeah I mean there are stories of exercises um after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff but here's the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not one and it's probably not an accent that I became a journalist\nAnd yet the stuff the uncanny the paranormal you read about this stuff all the time why there are some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real\nWithout throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window [noise]\nWould you make of that store without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's just there's no way one of the most interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism who's Michael ... he is a scientist an atheist a regular columnist for Scientific American he has the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have some would throw cold water on these crazy\nCarnival stories the strange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife's from a clone Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music admitted to her and when he died she kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway and when she we met and bell of and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know the day of our\nWedding just set a particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and\nFriends a long way from home you know we're in music playing in the back of the house is like what was that you know and I thought well it must love my iPhone on my laptop\nCan ... it was none of that and then we [noise]\nIt was over the Germany the fax machine and they are there is there a plane is blamed Islam is a\nPerfectly you know perfectly to the station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience it meant something to her seltzer symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there with us today every wedding and make her feel good and it did [noise]\n\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went\nThere the next morning and the debt ever sense even though I get it to work and there's still a work it's still there [noise]\nTo just share my that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence\nOr not really but [laughter] it kind of shook him\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter] uh yeah a little bit but but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more\nOpen to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand that yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this and I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of ... skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you know my friend is not really religious friends with people I ... I think that there's sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this in a quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife had numerous experiences and last year and a half or she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't come on\nA kind of it but this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting at the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of fights\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is\nBeyond the natural I think science studies from natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Daniel or a man who signed the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital and I found myself up in the corner to room looking down on my body [noise]\nKeep those the things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things with other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leading their body and we're sitting around me nice experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the ... community practitioners of magic and she joined in\nSo as not politicians do you do what they feel that you've come to study does now

entire books for me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work as an ... path which is\nA psychic ability I have this odd ability to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio that's the way to look at me and who argue channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere is a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage and history but I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of women meditation what do they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your gut\nShowed up and sat down he was you know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hat and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston do entering was raised and it was higher clinics and I didn't know what any of it meant at the time and um he had blue eyes very blue\nEyes and a long beard and he had a Purple Rose of some time and still when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I think that's how he presented himself for me to\nThis all sounds kinda crazy yeah an acting imagine maybe when he first started having these experiences that might\nHave felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of her religion is not only not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostic ... I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened then I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that to us what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and around that all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I could explain it\nAnd I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things these flashes started you know going off so when you say seem lights around people with that was what did they look like wells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head\nSo I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nAnd I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical already might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was in NYU for twenty five year teaching creative writing like writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing and even now I'm not ...

one of the super twelve assigned a tyrant Saddam Hussein during this trial\nThese where young men many just out of basic training spent months alone in close quarters\nWith a man the rest of the world

such young inexperienced soldiers were doing gardening such a high value prisoner and what effect that might have\nWith Adam Adam with us just come out with a book about the super twelve it's called the prisoner\nPalace [noise]\nYou know when they went over there I think they were expecting to kind of do what soldiers expect to do which is get into combat situations and potentially engage with and and kill bad guys and that's why a lot of these guys joined to begin with\nSure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly that a lot of them joined us out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kind of bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys didn't have special training after some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids the kids from like you know higher that seems strange to me\nYeah no I mean they were in some cases not far removed from basic training caliber Eighteen\nYeah I mean it was it was remarkable they weren't special operators they weren't you know

like a bomb I think that did a tremendous amount of damage to his when he saw as as his prestige and so from that moment on he resolved to present himself\nTo his people as this defiant leader a

holding him\nAnd he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras on how you treat me he tricked me great [noise]\n\nThe trial and we all know with an execution hanging could you tell me about that day what happened at the execution\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday it replays in my mind a lot [noise]\nI was a ship that night and we all knew that it was coming close\nYou know we broke his radio so he couldn't here\nAnd ah [noise]\nWe got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up and\nWe did in the new [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and\nFixes hair but his suit on his watch on you got dressed to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down\nAnd that was that was pretty intense because we figure\nIf someone is going to come get him or he was planning to escape he's going to do it now [noise] so that was that was a very intense time just cleaning their weapons and making sure everything was [noise] um point with there so [noise] yeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean\nWhen he when ... I'm Sorry what mhm what did he say to you you personally how do they say goodbye to you\nIt was very it was very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone no one was going to come and get him and\nHe sort of two before he walked into the\n[noise] the deaths house and uh [noise] he turned around and say goodbye [noise] and it said that we were all his friends [noise]\nSome of us were crying and he was a [noise] but just for that split second just see him in motion state [noise]\nIt was a it was crazy we've done in firefights we've been through IDs [noise] but at that [noise] nothing to prepare you for that type of situation [noise]\n\nHappened after that immediately after\nThey worked so hard to comport themselves in a professional dignified manner to treat him the way they were supposed to and then it kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution when Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch that [noise]\nI think that I was a [noise]\nI really didn't know\nTo do I I've never seen anything like that my life you know it's just like wow that [noise]\nI mean it was a wild wild west to me like [noise] like I've only seen the movie is but to hear it\nIt was intense I really wasn't [noise]\nI was more protected than I was sad because [noise]\nWhen you're asked to protect something like that and\nThose posts to hurt him and you just have that ruled by our brain and it's easy to influence or twenty two year old\nWhen you see a chicken spit out his body [noise]\nI just I just have to respect the presence of death I guess [noise]\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remarks about that [noise]\nBut this experience had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why what is it that he was able to kill from a distance and almost joke about it off handily but here we are with essentially the worst of our enemies and playing a role in that particular death really hurt him in trouble and have [noise]\nOuch later reflected I feel like I have to explain why bother me so much for an American to be upset but for us to stand by and let them treat another human being that way I thought that's what we were over here to stop the treatment like that I truly felt that I was just as guilty as anybody else [noise]\nI've never really had a conscience about anything I've ever done over here as far as humanity goes I've seen some pretty bad things\nBut my job had never before said that I have to stand there and watch people have been on and kept a person's body [noise] and you know what I'm Glad I feel that way I really am if I didn't feel that way I Would think something was wrong [noise]\n\nSo would you say that I mean I Want to use this word lightly but are are traumatized by what happened in Iraq\nOh absolutely a hundred a hundred percent um\nI live with the though those demons everyday but don't get a twisted like he he\nWas tried for his crimes and that is the judgment that they came down with and I'm not saying that he didn't deserve it I'm saying that as a twenty\nTwo year old soldier maybe I wasn't ready\nFor that I think ... low I wasn't the one who dropped the four out um sometimes I feel like I did\nOh Adam Rogers was one of the soldiers in Iraq who guided Saddam Hussein\nWill bargain weapons book about them is called the prisoner and the palace and Charles been real gain talked with both of them\nHere's my question\nHow can someone to be a monster and Saddam Hussein's case torturing and killing thousands of people need gas to some subjects and close seem like a decent\nIn other words what happens when the moral categories good and bad\nThat we saw people into fall apart\nI'm an strain chance

think the book came out in the early seventies and it was banned for like Twenty years because it looks at the Holocaust from the point of view of a a guy who was a prison guard at a a concentration camp\nOh\nHave you even know if I like the book but I kept thinking about the book because of the crazy questions to ask the way that it treats the eagle missed that people bring to bear and all kinds of ways and the way we forgive them and don't forget them it's just it's a book that really just sits on your show just won't give up I\n\n\n\nMean it's an easy book to read them to say oh you know
