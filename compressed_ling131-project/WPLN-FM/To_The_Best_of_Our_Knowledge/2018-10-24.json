Virginia where I grew up\nYeah I was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery to bury and one of my coworkers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there are so family members in Michigan still time in Ohio they all just kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just thinking about\nThe history of this I mean if you have the son of Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these brands of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRace it's interesting how little he sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things and I think you can avoid kind of feeling the weight of that here\nMm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOoh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life Sally Hemings and that they had children ... what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white\nDescendants denied and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings children even DNA evidence she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award and she told steep\nAwesome this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they'd been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison that asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson this revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you\nKnow the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what what am I ... well\nThat kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take 'em down from the mountain as this revered I don't\nKnow there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jefferson Washington and all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the better with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time an earth than some of it was good and some of them was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already mystic view of race relations to me I mean he was he was racist and he he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart as when you\nThat most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I venture it as a suspicion only but they're not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time I Do think he thought slavery\nOther things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine\nBut it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which the union will be split and that was true yeah\nThank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh thank you for having me Mm\nThat's Harvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with Steve ...\nHer book the Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer Prize at the national memorial ...\nSuch a day you don't have to go digging in libraries to find your roots with genetic ancestry testing all you need is a drop of bed and I have to\n... and one college classroom\nThat's how the semester begins I'm\nFor the past twelve years I have had people actually take the DNA ancestry tasks and both look at the diversity within and then how that connects you to other people you might not have thought you were connected to him about [noise]\nWe reveal on a day altogether and then have a discussion and it's always fascinating [noise]\nWe hand out the results\nIn an envelope or in a folder\nWe said oh now go head an open them [noise]\nYou're looking at a pie chart it takes a minute to process what you're saying [noise]\nAnd then you start the hero the responses\nSomebody 'cause yes [noise]\nSomebody else 'cause I Can't believe that [noise]\nWhere did this come from\nOff the results are in the outrage begin [noise]\nNext how genetic testing is changing conversations about race I'm an strain champs back to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio\n[noise] NPR acts [noise]\nWhen my daughter received her new Nashville public radio one ... she was well I don't want to see speechless\nAnd when she saw how it's the backseat listener across the ... she got pretty into it

Nashville public radio mug tote pint last sock collection but don't take my word for it\nHopefully that won't five seven six zero twenty ten or visit WPN dot org\nThis hour we've been talking about how the legacy of slavery lives on not just in history books not just in our laws and institutions in communities\nBut in our blood so what\n... is both black and white African and European like Westchester University in Pennsylvania and needed Feldman leads to DNA discussion project every semester students in her class take a genetic ancestry test\nAnd she says the results can change the story states how about themselves and others\nOften in profound ways\nI started twelve years ago when somebody said I think I read an article that said you could trace somebody's ancestry based on their DNA\nAnd I thought boy I bet that there are a lot of people walking around thinking their backgrounds are one thing and they are different and how would that change the conversation that we had about race\nPicture this you have a class full of undergraduate kids and they all sit in a test tube and send it away and is there a big unveiling daily I get that result [laughter]\nYes and almost invariably there's something there that is unexpected and people are funny it really runs the gamut somebody will say the test is not right you know tested over\nBut they also start to see that they're connected to people that they did not think they were connected to ... and it's it's really neat in one setting there was a young white guy who had two or three percent Africans background he was sitting\nNext to African American gentleman and they wanted a high five and I mean it was sort of reflecting in my life I mean here is this appropriate [laughter] have you gone through\nYour own genetic testing I have it took me ten years\nTo do it and I said what would Freud\nSay and indeed found some things I expected and the things that I didn't expect like what\nI was surprised how much of European I'm African American I was surprised how much European was in my background twenty five percent European which floored me the most stunning experience that I had\nWas that I went to Guyana several years before I took the test and as part of that trip we went to a place called the door of no return which is where the slaves went out on the ships and just never returned\nAnd so when I looked at my profile I'd significant Guyana and my background and I thought oh my goodness one of my relatives literally probably went through that door and I was surprised at my own reaction and I've heard other people say that they have been surprised\nAt their own reaction\nSurprised how just how emotional that was for me and I think that that is something that a lot of African Americans experience it's hard to articulated it sort of a low level anxiety\nJust this tremendous feeling of sadness\nAs a person who has a background in slavery where you were systematically told that you are just not fully human too to face that directly by looking at my DNA was very potent for me\nI just imagine that the they must be such a mixed range of emotions\nYou know on the one hand maybe there's some real joy and discovering your African roots which particular parts of Africa being able to really connect viscerally and at the same time you know as you said it it makes that legacy of slavery
