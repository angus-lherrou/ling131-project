...\nWho are functioning as a kind of false\nMichel ... is a form of a secular religion that's what it is there's also you know why people to believe these strongman most of the um it's a strong man who present himself as the entire politician leader who will cure suicide at the old social evils\nNo usually the label it is used to identify some of these people and we should get the specifics in a moment is they are populists yeah but you you sort of object to that word I mean you\nActually call it for what it is yeah well look\nDonald Trump also populist and Bernie Sanders most populous bronco by most also populist if everybody is a populist and nobody is a full you know this whole notion of populism is in these kinds of euphemism to avoid the F word\nPeople like will surely me Hitler the

to activate the base here saying there's not a clear ideology of okay this is what we want to do with the country it's more it's a series of resentments and hatred\nIt's old technique that's why it's a tremendous mistake to think we can only recognized ... if it looks like as we have seen it\nIn black uniforms with Jimmy justice as we sold into food to sing the forties that's not the case what is the case is that at the time of styling the people in the Soviet Union\nBoston a mouse to fire Mueller some they all spoke in terms of so we are dealing with ... so for them so you're saying fascism can be on the left as well as on the right Oh absolutely absolutely again it's the anti democratic spirit\nAnd it's the spirits of people from mine said who are only interested in themselves it's all about her own power\nFor that they create these fishy to cope with its religious overtones being the messiah who can do all the things and again if you remember how Trump announced his candidacy he came from\nQuote unquote have fun [laughter] downstairs on the elevator ethical bench and he presented himself you know out of the darkness into the lie so you have all these things you're making a serious charge or I mean you're calling Donald Trump a fascist\nHis absolute the or the ... but look I mean what what is outrageous about it we have the same feeling in Hungary we have put in all ... we have for the turkey have in Russia I mean what's the problem with just telling the truth\nBecause I think when we think about fascism or a fascist movement there's the sense that it sweeps aside all governmental institutions and you know Trump could very easily I voted out and twenty twenty we have a you know health elections we have show but you see if you see what's happening if you'll institutions right now\nMake the free press suspect make their churches suspect\nBecause quote unquote they'll all the enemy of the people and Mr Trump is the greatest represent the ... of the people whatever that may be the institutions are as strong as to people but the base behind every institution east trust\nTrust is gum the institutions will go at the end of the day so this was a great message which a German immigrant in Nineteen fifty eight\nThe Noble Prize winner told his mom gay when he here in America went on the coast to coast on whole a lecture to talking about the Komen

democratic system which then will collapse and didn't\nThomas months say that fascism will rise in America in the name of freedom\nYes because the ferry important strategy of all leaders refer fish mindset is the politics of flies they a pathological liar so all of them\nAnd so it will come in the name of freedom or democracy they know how to use to rhetoric they know how to use the slogan they are in need of the propaganda machine ...\nSo what I Want to come back to the word again because I guess maybe I'm getting hung up on trying to actually label some of these politicians fascist [noise] the word that's used for a lot of these people who are coming to power including Donald Trump is authoritarian or you know look at some other countries in the word strongman is use\nPeople tend to avoid that word fascism because it is so loaded it is so connected to the historical legacy of Hitler and loosely particular why are you so insistent on calling these people fascist it's not that difficult to understand that if you see\nWhat has happened in Europe [noise] multiple ... which started out of the blue for no good reason by the killing of the crown prince owned a twenty eight of June Nineteen fourteen and a couple of months later the whole thing was set on fire\nThen because the rise of the fish east movements in Germany Italy frogs spray central Europe than it was almost a fourth\nOne I Want people to understand is that the developing which we're seeing now in Western Europe and in America\nI Know I had left that were out by the time he was spending a lot of time as an anti Nazi trying to the program yeah the skinheads and said two months after the massacre these two men met at a local Thai restaurant and they talked\nFor hours Charleston round Cain ask them to tell their story party you reached out to earn a few months after the massacre why\nYou know one word answer is understanding I think a lot of times we do things and we think that we understand\nAnd we take stuff as gospel as far as like somebody telling us something and we echo chamber ourselves we build silos from the echo chambers that we we do this subconsciously\nThat it was very important for me to reach out to somebody who can give me the authenticity that this is a tragedy deserved I wanted to reach out to understand and I also had a feeling\nThat aren't all had the same feelings that I did\nAnd so I Believe in that spirit and I reached out to our low and and I met at the restaurant and ah I definitely got a got a better understanding of why the shooter did what he did but more importantly than that I I I gained a friend that would be an ally going forward for our community\nYou know are no I got to interrupt to ask a question to you if you can answer it honestly for me what were you before you changed\nI actually made weighed page were pretty tame\nI started away bar's gonna do in Milwaukee with some friends of mine that Jang linked up with other white power is going to games around the country\nAnd today that skinhead gangs is the largest organized labor is going to a group on earth for seven years I Lived that life and I recruited people I specifically look for wounded white kids\nKids who had been through some drama they were the ones who were most ripe for message\nRecruited vehemently all the time and if you didn't get recruited by me I was just as happy to break your face for you and I got in the street fights constantly or would attack ...\nPretty much anybody or betray early on any given time just for the thrill of violence and I was a lead vocal\nFor a very popular why power band\nIn many ways I wasn't exactly who it is used to be he was part of the same game at our hope to start he was also in white barbarians I Would be stunned if he had never heard of my band and I would not be surprised if he was a fan\nOf the music that I made screaming people to go and murder each other 'cause of the color of their skin I Can't imagine\nI mean you're a former white supremacist what what is it like to get an email from her deep and that must have been incredible what was that like\nI was actually super excited I was really honored in the weeks following orders of I did a tone of media\nThat was doing media like eight to ten hours a day from all over the world because I had\nBeen doing these education work as like a former wars in front of us for a couple of years already at that point in a early at a pretty high profile and\nI had a real mixed feelings about all the media I was doing because I was in those transition point rose going from being an energy consultant to being a professional speaker\nAuthor [noise]\nTo my perspective ... wow and I the entire time I'm doing all these interviews I just wanted to go back to removing the servers if it could have brought these six people bug\nBut at the same time there's always a part of me internally that wants to beat myself up through I was and what I've done and that part of me it was very much at the forefront Sam like oh good job or on did you go get some speaking gigs and sell some books because people are dead\nParty but I Wonder at this point when you guys are having dinner together where you were you aware of how far behind aren't put his past and with that part of the reason you want to talk to them\nNow at this point I really wasn't aware how far\nIs history was our America you know if you put it in the past even so you didn't know that he had really changed\nNo no I I mean I had um you know kind of had a hunch that he changed\nBut as the dinner day was getting closer and closer and closer and as I shared with family and friends what I was about to do and who I was about to talk to I Would assume your mom did not like that at all in all my mom didn't like that my wife didn't like that there are people who are in the community who had just gone through this\nParty [laughter] what did you get out of our meeting with are now it seems like he was a racist violence man's kinda the opposite of who you are it's like it seems like you have a lot to offer him but what is it what does he get out for you\nSo I mean does this come back to understanding if you don't understand why somebody would be able to do something like this\nAnd have answers I don't think that you can genuinely process and he'll you can fake it I Would definitely faking it after August it because I knew we had to put on a brave face for the world\nFor me are law has been my greatest therapist and I am a therapist [laughter] so I [laughter] I guess they've been my brother my confidant\nHad a lot of battles together and the battles are political battles up personal but as far as like a you know why we\nFind ourselves there together I Believe in in the defiant spirit and I believe some some way to divide spare brought us together\n[noise] I don't know how to you when you're having dinner with him and then you become friends work together how do you not just feel guilty all the time for your past I I'm just curious how you don't or just overcome by guilt Everytime you see him [noise]\nAh I Want to make a positive impact in the world I understand that if I'm beating myself up and if I'm drawing and guilt for what I've done that it diminishes my capacity to have a positive impact in the world\nAnd not that I don't deserve to be myself up and I've spent a very long time doing the bat and back and I I felt that I'd I deserve nothing but suffering I did not deserve love I did not deserve happiness\nBecause of what I had done and because of who I was in the party has taught me that that doesn't help anybody that doesn't an honor his father does an honor\nThe other five was logged on his stuff that doesn't honor anybody who is suffering if I Am tormenting myself like this what what does honor them is one I Am out cultivating compassion and kindness and forgiveness in this society because those qualities\nAre what makes our society one that's less conducive to really kind of violence that happened on orders of\n[noise] you know party here philosophy and what you and aren't on work on it seems that it's about compassion forgiveness but it seemed to but a lot of pressure on the victim which would be you in this instance to be a part of the solution like\nI mean I speak for myself on this I I'm I wanted to pressure when we get pressure to somebody we also give power and that's what we're talking about we're talking about reclaiming us as a power that we want to make it that forgiveness is not really about forgetting and the forgiveness is\nA survivors vengeance against what happened to them and their ability to come back from that and even the first time I mean I Know that are low talked a lot about who who used to be in all the bad things that are used to be for the first time that I saw or no I didn't see all that I saw a person that was still suffering and still in pain\nAnd when we can see that we can see the humanity within within each other at first and foremost ... teaches let's just see that guy like spirit within the next person that the spirit is alive and every person then if I'm really going to be a sick I have to see that same spirit and the shooter\nWade Michael Page I have to see that this person was actually a person and not a monster\nAnd have to understand that it's different that we're fighting against racism or racist because a racist as a people we personalize it to say you know what that person and we don't understand the suffering and the pain that has caused that\nThan we are just washing our hands of of of being the solution or ever solving anything like that\n[noise] you know that's the most beautiful thing I've heard in a really long time thank you both very much thanks for the use 'em\n\nThat Charles hurricane talking with tiny ... and ... you can read more about their journey and therefore coming book called the gift harbor who's sick and the former white supremacist find work and\nThey've also co founded the group serious to unite which works to create climates compassion and violence\nComing up\nThat transit hatred get spread in surprising ways\nGiven in literature well probably not the right term for this by\nSaddam Hussein had written a romance novels the ... and the king\n[laughter] what kinda room I don't know man\nDoes that kind of
