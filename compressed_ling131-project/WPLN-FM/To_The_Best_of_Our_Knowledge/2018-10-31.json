I think that there's a you know sort of a quantum field that inner connect all of us in a quantum consciousness way ... sets aside you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife had numerous experiences of last year and a half or she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't come on\nIt but this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable or there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting that the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of what\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Daniel Armand [laughter] signed the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties and\nYou know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner of the room looking down at my body [noise]\nPeople see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things that other people couldn't tear they sometimes feel their mind leaving their body and was around me these experiences happen to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and\nWhen she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined it so I Apologize do you do what they feel that\nYou've come to study does no I'm In I cast spells I'm as part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot of that type of law and participated in these different groups as they met to\nCarry out their ritual metric did it become real for you or at least at times one of the things I could see was that people experienced the magic Israel\nI'm conscious channel I take dictation from guides that worked for a million actually dictate entire books through me that require no editing so I'm primarily known as a conscious channel and I also work as an ... path which is\nA psychic ability I have this either donated to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio that's the way to look at me and who argue channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that there are teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness than we are at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in\nIdeas of lineage and history but I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen but I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the the lettering was raised and it was hieroglyphics and I didn't know what any of it in that time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a purple robe of some time and still when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really excellent that's how he presented himself for me so this all sounds kinda crazy yeah it can imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might\nHave felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of her religion is not only not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostic system I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year out of graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought what\nThat's really what happened and I began to pray or to embark on why now knows the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that too I what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like\nA fog comes in and rounds out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I could explain it and I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I started seeing might surround people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things is flashes started you know going off\nSo when you say see lights around people with that was what did they look like\nWells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nAnd I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was at NYU for twenty five years teaching creative writing my writing yeah I talked play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing and even now I'm not ... I'm traveling around the world\nSitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them as all of this energy comes in and filled the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with your dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse's name I can step into your spouse speaking to look like her and possibly hear what's going on at the dynamic them that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nHe'll he'll play that out from ... explain that farm if you can when you say you're like a radio you know you got to sort of tune into the range handle and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you see how does that work I mean ... where are you in now where where is Paul ... heated\nI'm president but I'm receded a you sort of in an altered state of consciousness come at all like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt and ... and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of the sessions\nWait they really are to you or you're not going at you know sort of cleaning up the way you're saying these books you know they're not written by you it's written by your automatic writing and you know no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who ask those questions ... while you're sitting with one right now these are not going to access it myself because I actually don't know and I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off this conversation\nBut you know honestly when I first started doing the stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group at my apartment been met for Eighteen years with about ten people who would show but the most\nEvery week and we would sit in a circle with guides would talk and they would bring this energy true and we would all feel it\nWhat are the guys say you were you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have through new mayor that is they're sort of a common message [noise] yeah I think\nThat who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talked about humanity being at a at a transitional point that's evolution right now\nAnd that the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nPrimarily based and a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success with beauty is all of these things that we collectively ascribed great value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear and needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different here or not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that my I was very frightened person ... much of my life\nAfraid of what my things life yeah life you\nKnow I was a sensitive kid you know when I grew up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am you know there's a quote from Helen shook them and the woman who was the channel for a course in miracles [noise] she said I don't believe it but I Know it's true\nAnd I can get behind that I understand\nThat I don't believe it either but I Know it's true\nWhat you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I ... I don't I Know that it's happening I\nDon't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do\nI'm I'm very happy to be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul satellite he's published five channel taxed Steve we started earlier talking about your family and all the stories of family goes to the paranormal has given all these interviews changed how you feel about your family's experience different stories yeah it has it has\nUm [noise] yeah I take them more seriously we have really good conversation [laughter] when the family gets together 'cause you know we have these mutual interest and we come at it very differently and uh I'm a speaker\nAnd you know I had my own way of doing it and they are secrets to", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "31"}
