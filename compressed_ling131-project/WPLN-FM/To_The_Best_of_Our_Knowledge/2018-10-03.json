of building blocks did you used to create that well I was\nReally excited when I was there with ... you know when he pulled out this arrogance because it was I had a pretty good idea of what I was going to do\nReally sort of been in everyday life everything whether to voice or an air gun or a bird everything has pitch and rhythm weight does an air gun have a pitch it does it actually has actually multiple pitches playing at the same time but\nBut yeah so basically on the score I wrote an orchestra company meant that matched the pitches and the harmonies and the rhythm actually of the

the person's hand you invite piece to you and that person and\nWe should all be about peace you know a\nLot of tell me about the guy even if you're the guy behind the counter like CSI Sean cast me the storm Afghanistan is Muslim but he's also like a young guy he was just kind of connected you know socially culturally to the neighborhood around him\nDiscrimination is everywhere brother that was my problem too I said man these people over here crazy\nCrazy yelling all the time I live over here too so it's never quiet but um [noise]\nAfter a year or two living here you know I realized that

it's an urban environments sometimes a residential and sort of a lot quieter and a lot of birds you know maybe you listen to comes on those blocks\nFrom the list or could perhaps draw their own conclusions Glenn car Ari\nWe've been talking about sonic prejudice but I Wonder if there are ways in which communities of color or disenfranchised neighborhoods have also use found to define and\nCarve out a space I guess I was thinking that isn't that part of the story of the rise of hip hop in the Bronx in the seventies\nVery much so I've also research Harlem in the Nineteen forties and the way that black and brown people black people in Puerto Ricans had conversations about noise in the newspaper in conversations about\nDo we share space everybody celebrates sometimes it's not that certain people are noise makers and certain people aren't and you'll see from that period the Amsterdam news urging black readers to be more tolerant say of Spanish accents in their community\nThat hey when we moved up from the south we were discriminated against for our southern speech so we don't want to think of Spanish as something that doesn't belong or is noisy\nAnd hip hop is another place where ... black and Puerto Rican people together [noise]\nDJ's like Africa and bought a [noise] use sounds from wherever the television from Europe and things like a craft work [noise]\nAnd moms record collection\nBringing all those things in creating these new town to create a space [noise] of togetherness in a way to actually in vision a new community versus what was called\nThe burned out Bronx I'm by many people in New York City at the time [noise] [noise]\nYou must hear and read about examples of this whole time what's the most recent example where you thought yup there it is again\nActually there was a story of a woman in the summer in North Carolina a doctor this is covered by the Washington Post in may she was at home celebrating good news she had just heard she was pregnant she had just received a prestigious cardiology fellowship\nAnd she turned on her spot if I play list on a Saturday afternoon\nAnd turned on her play list of nineties hip hop [noise]\nThings\nLike juvenile and the ... gene Puff Daddy and you know she says she listens to for an hour and was feeling joyful and dancing turned it off\nSat down and watch the news\nNeighbors had called the police on her for playing loud music\nInstead of ignoring it and saying hey it's Saturday someone's in a good mood downstairs or knocking on her door again creating community relationships having a conversation about it\nThey just went straight to the police and the police abruptly knocked on the door scared her in her own home made her feel like even though she has the right to be there that class status to be in this particular place\nShe didn't belong in this neighborhood that her her white neighbors don't tolerate her ways of being an or consciously listening for it we can also amplifies sounds we hear\nThe more we fixate on certain sounds the more we begin to notice any tuned to them\nRight so the story over and over again of people being silenced literally yes well\nYou're opening up this whole kind of language that to me seems to be about the ethics of listening to the ethics of hearing moving from sonic prejudice to a model of sonic inclusiveness\nBut that is a legacy that I can leave I Will be honored and appreciative I I really encourage people to\nStop and observe reactions that we've come to understand as natural or immediate to sound why am I upset at this particular moment that my\nNeighbor is playing a certain kind of music why am I accept that my neighbors are using their front yard to have a party versus their backyard\nSound triggers a lot of these deeply held feelings about race and\nClass and the way we think about race and class influences what we hear and if we can really begin to break that automatic assumption [noise] a lot of things can change [noise]\nJennifer Lind stover teaches at Binghamton University she's the author of the sonic color line and also editor in chief of the sound studies blog sounding out\nSo time to rethink what you consider noise [noise]\nDavid rocking bird [noise] he's been thinking about that too [noise]\nNoise traditionally is just so we don't like [noise]\nIt could easily be a show someone else why [laughter]\nElectric guitar makes a really pure so but we want to plug it into distortion feedback was functions\nLike noisy minutes we'd like to ... [noise]\nThe same thing you find in urban [noise]\nPeople go out and seek to loud as possible places to dance [noise]\nTry and talk and loud bars and the people actually like [noise]\nSometimes we liked loud so [noise]\nSometimes we think it's noisy or too much noise or other times we actually enjoy [noise]\nA lot of it's our attitude toward what's around us [noise]\nSo what happens if you lean into the noise [noise]\nWe'll find out next\nTo the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio\nNPR acts\nOh\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nCities are full of that can cities also be music composer and philosopher David Rothenberg would say yes absolutely [noise]\n\nWell you can think about the history of noise used as music [noise]\n\nPierre Schaffer in Paris right after World War two kept up with the idea of music con crept music made out of actual concrete sounds in the real world back then he was just playing record and she had made actual vinyl records of train sound and he said just listen to this train whistle\n\nLet's change the speed let's repeat it becomes like a musical moment [noise]\nPeople were quite skeptical\n[noise]\nTowards the end of his life he live very long time and he's sort of thought that he was a complete failure [noise]\nThat can do this on your phone [noise]\nFriend of mine is recording sounds of buses\nUsing this microphone designed to record\nBack very high frequency sounds\nAnd turns out the buses are making all these super high frequency sounds we can't hear you lower the pitch it really sounds incredibly beautiful\nLike the wire singing\n\nOne particular way of describing sounds it actually comes out of the pie or shape your traditions that notion of the shower or what you said [noise]\n\nAn idea from garden design in the Eighteen century perfect beauty that it was planned and unplanned was accidental but exact [noise]\nLike when you're making music in the subway doors or in the same key is the music you're making or maybe you should a mixture of noises somehow it's beautiful any of these recordings in the moment it seems to make sense [noise]\nI feel like I'm going for this mystery effects [noise]\nCome to a place to mixtures town just so perfect you go like ha ha this is the ex can't describe what it is but we got it here [noise]", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "03"}
