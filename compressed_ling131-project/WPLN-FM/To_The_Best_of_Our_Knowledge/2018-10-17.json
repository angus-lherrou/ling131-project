R. tax [noise]\n\nMm\n\nMm\nMm\n\n\n\nMm ...\n\nMm\nMm\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nWe're talking about politics this hour\nAnd I don't want to make you feel like you're walking through a minefield every day but don't you know that there are a lot of poisons growing\nAll around us [laughter] they got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about poisonous to land\nSocrates was killed by him lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell those stories not to write a field guide poisoners plan\nBut to talk about wind plants have actually killed someone now are being used in warfare or for some dark energy various purpose [noise]\nAmy Stewart is a mystery writer she's the author of the best selling cop sisters theories she is also a serious Gardner with side gig\nWriting about wicked plants\nShe introduced Janet Henry fiber to a few\nAbraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake route poisonous cows would grades on this plant the poison would make them sick\nBut also get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those ...\nPeople with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human\nIt's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been lifted as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I've out that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get\nYou can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve men drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant started getting offered to me kind of secretly like you\nActually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plans including some illegal plant\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I owe ... maybe you've heard of a loose new genetic plan from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the da's very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting yeah so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones\nThat identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or\nBlindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter] so I had all these lightly divide skulls and hands and and so I had some sort of Ohio like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical\nWas it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants so I was growing Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poison depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an ability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and that is something that we're finding out more about the one way that plants communicate is through route exits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bugs ... attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure\nOut do you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nThis is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things are green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strychnine as a hundred percent plant based [laughter] it was a cyanide so it was a rice and they're just trying to keep from getting eat\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to eat them\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken mountainous town\nAnd that was shot and Henry cyber talking with her\n\nReally fascinating things about poisons [noise]\nIs it in small doses they can cure\nLarger doses killed\nSo much power in a simple leaf for mushroom or a white powder\nFor the right or wrong person\nCan be tempting\n[laughter] we're capturing if I wanted to poison someone today what would be the best way to go about it oh\nCentral I knew that you want\nTo get away with that absolutely when what do you need to do in a very good study on\nHow they have any she can see the [noise] he wants to pick up a point then that mimics some innocent when you're trying to the point the autopsy their little\nTentative of course is cheap poison someone using heavy ones and then leave the country to somewhat that doesn't have an extradition treaty that deal out of the real options she won't she points I'm going to get away with it [noise]\nAnd what about delivery mechanisms really\nPassionate to shake contact poised and poise that would have been held in Django Unchained wall oh I get to the huge it's a very intimate kind of killing don't you think [noise]\nIt's a statement it is quite staggering and terrifying the amount to do that goes to the price is very very dangerous and unpleasant [noise]\n\nKatherine ... is a chemist and writer and author of a is for arsenic\nWe tracked her down in Valencia, Spain where she is currently investigating another classic literary Poizner\nComing up one of the most famous poisoning stories and America is not quite over\nForest Nineteen\nYes and what was it you were telling me about\nUnderneath the stone she's buried in a lead lined\nYes when they ... they took her to Argonne National lab and when they brought her back she was is in a light line cloth and although one of my aunt\nShe always thought that they never return the body\nSo there may be a lot of radioactive bodies here in the summers are there are\nLimits to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio\nO\nP R tax\n\n\nIn the Nineteen twenties and thirties radio the glow in the dark wonder element discovered by Marie Curie spawned a whole new American industry luminous clock and watch faces radium dials painting factory sprang up the employed hundreds of girls and young women to do this really delicate painting\nAnd the girls were told to keep their brushes shark my gently sucking them ... lip pointing\nHave you know anything about radioactivity you can guess what happened\n... years investigating the story and the result is her book radium girls\nI was transfixed by the extraordinary true story of women fight things that our rights\nAnd I was really struck that as that goes on Nick pointing putting that paint Russia's between that lets which was the ...\nAnd you know that's one of the wing radioactive substances you were reading what by doing and you're thinking no don't do it and the same way that if you want your horror movie you you think you know the young blown heroin and she will and I'm not talking now [laughter] and you're thinking don't do it you feel the same about these ...\nYou described some wonderful scenes so radium it's glow in the dark as we said it made the girls literally glow and China and they loved that\nThey did absolutely they themselves without the use some of the paint as makeup they put it on that leads to shut eye they paint that teeth with it that was what\n... what you want on the dark China [laughter] [laughter] Catherine wolf one of\nThe Illinois dial painted talks at how the women would wet that good to dress as to the plant because often they finished what they'd go out in the dumps holes on the radio ... would be the lungs shining and shimmering with this theory old ... was that flooding and don't sing to the latest jazz June\n... just so poignant really uh\nYou know for that and it was just a joke kind of law and say they weigh this glamorous kind of entourage that would go as they ... through the streets of new ... New Jersey and in ... in Illinois\nWho was the first girl to die of radium poisoning and and what happened to her\nName was ... so it started in Mali in her teeth which was true with many dial painted she had to buy two that was ... she went to the dentist and he extracted it\nBut then her next to ... started to hut and then the next one she goes to the dentist absolutely desperate for some kind of help to some kind of a used to this excruciating pain that she's suffering\nAnd the dentist reaches into her mouth with his hand and gently ...\nAnd it breaks against his fingers\nAnd he is able to lift it out of her mouth and a week later he does the same to the rest of the ... in her mouth\nAnd just to explain what ... does the ... and that could be your own bone unlike your hips you'll ... you'll buy and and it was actually\nMaking holes in the woman's buttons say when the dog to study then they found that they honey kind unless the ten\nAnd say what money ... was trying to treat with aspirin\nWas ah you know how things were literally having holes drilled in Kathryn Shaw one of the radium go set that the paying ... to a dentist joining on a life of days weeks months a time that's what she said the pain of being a righty and go with like\nAnd in the meantime the girls would go to the companies and the companies would say no or they say you're imagining it or you're making it up and they would they pay doctors to testify against the girls the level of the cover up but it's kind of hard to believe it's really quite shocking\nAs you say the the debts the depravity to which they would sing they hired private detectives to dig up dust on these women you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be ... inhumane\nOne I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the tests\nCreated a list of who's going to die first yeah that is exactly what happened they graded them depending on how radioactive Iowa\nAnd so I saw in the ... when I was researching it Saturn black and white a list of all the women's names on a number next to that name you know from one three to five I don't see how somebody could look at a woman a young woman no\nYou've got her name on a list and you know she's going to be dead in a year and a look her in the face and say you're fine\nWhen I I I think it just goes to show just how expendable and disposable people full of women are not time that was one funding Connecticut to settle with that girls\nAnd one woman ... who died and he's six months off the sheep and not right on to fend off it has been the settlement\nBut this time they also had him was forty three dollars and Seventy five cents\nOh my God less than fifty dollars for human life keep it one of your favorite young women to tell us about just introduced us and yeah tell us about her\nAttire was very hard to pick just [laughter] but I Will pick Catherine moved down there who who was one of the and annoy dial paint is pastor and was Nineteen when she started what that and it was half assed job\nAnd she was there for nine years she was actually fired for being sick she had a ... basically because the righty and had settled in had lack and they said how ... was closing tool you've given nine years of your life to a company and\nThey fight you for being sick but they've ... the sickness that was a very big mistake because well Katherine Dunn who did was that she fought back and it takes years say by the time the Illinois you win a finding suit is the great depression\nAnd say the Taliban against to and the women at disbelieve that shown that told ... foods in sheets and by the time the case comes to cool\nKatherine is incredibly sick she has a stock cutting the abundant GMO on how the hip caused by the radio and\nAnd it's the size of a grapefruit adult to talk about how white blood cell count which should be around eight thousand and she's got few hundred teeth are falling out how'd you find these crumbling in her mouth she is close to death\nAnd yet topped rain gives evidence on her deathbed she's too ill to actually physically go to court for the call comes to ha I mean have sitting room on the east ... street and also with Catherine la ... on her couch with a ...\nAnd she gives evidence in a week faltering voice she can fatty open our eyes even as she's getting her testimony and it's too late for her radium poisoning his fight 'til she knows she is going to die but she does it for her friends and she does it for half time they had children for her husband\nAnd I just think about is just a shining example of what these women did you know as you say that buddies were crumbling they were impoverished they were facing sudden death they grieving from the friends they lost and yet they stood up they fought for that writes wow\nThey did win in the end of the Supreme Court did finally rule against the company what happened next what happened to the company and and to the remaining curls", "year": "2018", "show_name": "To The Best of Our
