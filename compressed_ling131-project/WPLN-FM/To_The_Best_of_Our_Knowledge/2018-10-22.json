Virginia where I grew up\nYeah I was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery tours and one of my coworkers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there are so family members in Michigan still some in Ohio they all just kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean if you have the son of Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery like these trends of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRight it's interesting how little you sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous rights and he stands for so many things I don't think you can avoid kind of feeling the weight of that here\nMm\n\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\n\nBy now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life\nAnd Sally Hemings and that they had children ... what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants tonight and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally Hemings\nMa she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award she tells the pause\nOn this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery [noise]\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they've been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail ... we know about Madison that asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean what\nWhat ... well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodline\nConnections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon no there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country\nNot just Jeffrey assembled Washington at all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good until it was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already gotten mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he thought\nBlack people were inferior we're not as smart as ... and that's what most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine\nBut it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which the union will be split and that was true\nYeah thank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh thank you for having me Mm\nBats Harvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with the fall some ...\nHer book the Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer Prize at

for you [laughter] in the opening statement of your novel the archivist talks about the difference between mystery and secrets and it seems to me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and Andrew novel what do you think\nI Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is\nProfoundly inherent in all of reality it's the Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense\nThat there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there's something of an accent and hard to grasp and very often seems just beyond our reach\nBut there are times that our lives when we catch glimpses of it now\nAnd UFOs then identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion you why did you want even want to include so much us do content [noise] number one\nWeb streaming has made possible by Lipscomb universities online degree offerings designed for ambitious learners students can earn a bachelors or masters degree at their pace wherever they are learn more at Lipscomb dot edu slash on line\nAnd as I delved pretty deep into UFO history you quickly realize this is a phenomenon that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition and inhuman storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings but they have no explanation for understanding I cite\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming chariots and the sky\nAnd talks of meeting these giants the ... it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered and in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experienced it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you call this if you know going further back in ... the Wright brothers and things they should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of ...\nWell I mean in the ... in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they called it encounters with the fairies or ALS or in Germany they were ... or trolls are words that lived in the mountains even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people have told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge you\nAlso leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a I was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voice is that there were perhaps other ways of of viewing it I I think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and\nShining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody as small as insignificant and as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThan it can't be random there's got to be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just a sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the\nWorld exactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling\nFinal question what do you think is the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series\nFor it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched in some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a a lot of people\nIf you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick and cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps on the edge of their seat but\nTo go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf the storyteller and the culture is that it's our job\nTo keep mythology alive for people that it's akin to what ... did and the first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best\nThat's what storytellers do for our culture now\n... with\nMark ... is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch the truly series the third season of Twin Peaks debuted on may\n... will this\nYear's Booker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the bar down his complex multi character novel that during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln they'd love at San Willie dies probably of typhoid fever\nHe'd only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief and visits the cemetery Crips many times to hold his boy's body\nSteve wholesome talk with Georgetown dates when the book first came out and they began with a reading can you explain what's going on in the scene\nYeah there's a convention in the book that when a ghost\nI mean borrow actually me in Tibet means transitional state so there are several bartos I mean we're in one right now we're in the transitional stay between birth and death and so the bottom of the book sort of is the one that goes from the inside of your desk to the incident of your your next burst\nI mean in in a sense it's maybe analogous to purgatory although it's more driven by the use or you could say like the the person who goes to the bottle can get out if he or she is just willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own habituate and you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go onto the next step\nSo the danger of the ... you can get stuck there or you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably more true of my ... than the actual Tibetan borrow but at some point I kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not to have you done it but my guess is that whatever happens was going to be a real shocker [laughter]\nAnd ah [laughter] it is not going to be like oh this isn't just what we were told so so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be but be different enough that we shared and some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel\nJust this resonate for you personally I mean as more than just the literary device but ... the Buddhist concept\nAt the bar to oh yeah my wife and I having students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know a total beginner but they'd back in ... this life\nIn a sense you if the ideas that when you when you die\nYour mind is basically like a wild horse that gets a lot of the tether because now it's not dampen by your physical body anymore and the mind in that state they say can do anything it can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell if that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a a literal afterlife or if that doesn't suture you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane and the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that heaven and hell\nAre right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion are they're they're both exercises in world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises\nYes they are you know I think in world building especially in a book like this which is you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically and fund dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is that you do this kind of it are of approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd in a really magical thing was it you know about year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started kind of producing weird fruit you know there would be [laughter] turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving\nThat weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be if a kind of a cliche but I've heard\nA perfect being or you know a very good being used as a strong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of manage your daily activities says not to for the things individuality and I had that feeling really strong in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to now\nGet out of eight to sixty
