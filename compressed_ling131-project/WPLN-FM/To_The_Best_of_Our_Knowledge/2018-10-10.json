Alexander Hall is an investigative reporter and she first heard the story when she was working on a pro public a project called documenting hate\nWe're looking for hate groups in Wisconsin my boss told me about the story the headline was Madison police investigating possible ambush of proud boy by anti fascist and I thought were the\n[noise]\n\nYou know they seem really pissed off and irritated about woke culture and the PC culture that they feel like they have to apologize for being guys all the time and so what the Proud Boys are about is not happy and apologize for being a man's man\nAnd they want to return to that\n\nWe politically if you had to nail is on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five\nPercent of us land on the new right they're socially liberal fiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that but they think the tradition has some value in this in the you know we've drawn up the baby with the bathwater quite literally\nAnd uh you know do them when they're letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career in the logging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\nSo you you're right there you're going to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate\nIt seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and I'm\nLike feminism is obsolete\nIt definitely had a place that women needed to vote somebody needed to drive but the pendulum has swung way past that so I Would say feminism was done and maybe Nineteen Seventy nine and since then it's just been women in renting problems in lying\nLike saying one in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in college are saying that women earn less than men\nDo you think that has to sticks about sexual assault and the wage gap is just that it's not true\nWell I don't think you've looked it up if you think they are\nAnd that makes me think why do you care which makes me think you don't care which makes me think you need to find a man do you need to focus on creating an shaping lives because you don't sound like a tiny percentage that we'd better off in the workforce I think you'd make a great mom you're clearly curious\n[noise] I don't even know what to say about that [laughter] what did you think\nI thought it was a distraction I thought it was strange that he was making it personal\nWant to be curious about the quality of the schools your kids or\nIf you look on line and feel like a lot of the Proud Boys blog posts that they write are pretty offensive seem borderline angry\nAt women yeah so he was with us sending in\nCancer\nYou know\nI I just think it's [noise]\nIt's taken so much away from the traditional family\nThat it's kind of contributed to the degradation of\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis is a coordinated monthly tests of the broadcast stations in your area equipment that can quickly warn you during emergencies is being tested their fears have been an actual emergency official messages wouldn't follow the alert zone conclude this test of the emergency alert system\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] a health care for one I think nursing for one that that's one teachers early childhood education in men\nEngineering fields mass seals\nAre you saying that like men are better than no no\nMy little sisters of biomedical engineer she's great\nTo have a lot of ideas about where winning would be happy as\nAt home versus in the workplace\nHow's wiser looked down upon like they're not doing enough when really their shaping lives and what's more important than that [noise]\nAnd what do you think about women [noise]\nThey were very cautious about hey you don't want to be a housewife that school with us for the house science you want to be housewives don't look down on him\nPersonally I Love the idea of my wife's the trees my kids love to\nHave to be at work in the lead at work there's somebody there that's taking little Timmy to baseball practice or picking Sarah from soccer practice\nIn certain people have attempted to make them feel bad for them and we're doing we're entering a housewife or not is on a pedestal now that is the scene there is being a doctor my wife was a doctor and my wife is a ... [noise] they're they're to me\nAs far as ... concerned they hold the same way\nToo much of this conversation seems curiously nostalgic you know like ... for the day is when moms stayed home with kids and dad's had jobs that they could count on\nYeah it is interesting um you know I don't know how many of the Proud Boys actually believe all of that ... ... is a whole nother thing he's sane I Believe Ninety five percent of women would be happier at home you need to go home\nWe want women to be happier we weren't guys just stopped ignoring them in masturbating the porn we weren't guys to stop treating them like a ... for someone else's you Jackie late you know the feminist mentality bodes very well for guys who just want to screw women and then dumped them when they become thirty five\nI think women have their head screwed on properly they realize that it's these so called sexist who have their best interests in mind\nWe don't want them dumped we don't want them given the milk away for free 'cause we want them to sell the cow\nAnd no for the record [noise]\nWomen earn more than men when they're your age before they make babies they end up earning less over time because they choose to women tend to choose jobs that are less strenuous less risky they tend\nTo want to go home for their daughter's piano recital rather stay at the office all night and that costs them promotions down the line so the wage gap is an easy method he bought it takes you honestly sixty seconds\nAnd when feminist harp on it\nI go yeah you're pretending to carry your virtue signaling and it's a waste of everyone's time it's a pain in my ass\nYou kept your cool remarkably\nProbably if you had a video camera and the studios are doing the interview my eyes\nDid you find this or is that the ban Batman [noise]\n[laughter]\nStill this is news do you do you know the answer is not real\nMhm mhm\nThat's gotten McCann is talking with reporter Alexandra hall just with the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism and Wisconsin Public radio\nAnd a couple of things first if you're curious about the wage gap or those campus rape statistics\nWe posted some links on our website AT T T E book dot org [noise] we just heard the founder of a popular right wing men's group [noise] talk about generating women while simultaneously referring to them as Cal after me bags and cows [noise] we'll talk more about that [noise]\nAfter this\nMan strain champs and this is to the best of my knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise] NPR acts\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's the best of our knowledge I'm an strain champs we're talking about men's issues this hour and reporter Alexandra hall has been telling us about the Proud Boys\nA right wing men's club with chapters across the U.S the group's founder Gavin McGahn as\nBelieves feminism went too far and that most women would be happier as housewives we're talking about why does views are appealing to large numbers of young white man and to remind you again parents next part of the story includes references to adult sexuality probably not appropriate for\nKids [noise]\nYeah he did and I was like wow I'm really surprised to hear you say that free speech right and he was like yeah but tacked am I right\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAlexandra hall reporting on the Proud Boys was a joint project for Wisconsin Public radio and the Wisconsin Center for investigative journalism and also part of ProPublica's documenting hate projects\nOr\nWhen we come back we're going to put this story and some historical context Warren Farrow the father of the men's rights movement chimes that I'm an strength champs it's to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\nAnd we are at [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThe Nineteen seventies was the era of second wave feminine ms magazine Gloria Steinem Betty for them [noise]\nBut what a lot of people don't remember is that it offers a stark the man's liberation movement [noise] one of its early leaders was warned feral author of the myth of male power that look was cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never\nConsidered demands movement a backlash to feminine some more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement gave two girls and women was basically said two girls but let's say there's a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job and relatively decent job and the woman because pregnant as a woman's has basically shelf I have three options here\nOption one has to be full time it's all with my children option to be full time it's also took my workplace option three should do some combination of both the man\nWeb streaming is made possible by the launch your lawn show room showcasing antiques accessories and the ancient modern line for the contemporary home on the Web ... antiques dot com or six one five seven eight zero twenty six hundred\nSpins while you die sooner I think that's a very deficient definition of power and there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nSo what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what just as a response to because you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current form is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people ... out to be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and that nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean yes and as we as as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage innocent trolls on the Internet\nYes well first of all it it isn't an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain\nThat they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying trolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing\nWhen the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of now in New York City as you know\nI remember being on Barbara Walters showing the today show\nAnd Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement and it's where you have people like ... who was bisexual this was a number of years ago this was considered not okay and I said Barbara first of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhy don't we open our ears to what the women's movement is saying and instead of calling them dikes and brought burners why don't we hear their best intent and that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's move its best intent was\nWe should just reiterate this point because I mean this is kinda fascinating when you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies you worked for the national organization for women your called the Gloria Steinem of men's liberation I think that's going to surprise a lot of people\nReally the the myth of male power was really inspired in many respects um by better for dance second book the second major book called the second stage with what she said\nThat we've we've done a great job with women and now we have to focus on men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying leap reason that we don't listen to two men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic masculinity has about ... men in order to become successful\nHave to learn to repress their feelings not express their feelings\nSo when a man is feeling down and depressed we don't hear about it but he he may act out instead like drinking driving are getting ... DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though\nWe consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nMandy Moore and Sarah [noise] he's often called the father and the management and he wrote the classic math now power and that was awesome [noise]\n\nYou know boys started getting messages about what it means to be a mom [noise]\nYoung [noise]\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years oh you're the man of the house you got to take care of your mother and your sister and your baby brother like seven oh I just want to go play and he told me that I was like what does that mean\nThis is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching you notice that a lot of supplies at his school are kind of checked out they weren't going to class they weren't doing their work\nAnd the majority of them weren't graduating so shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for boys and in that club he pushed them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a\nThing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people there are clear that they have a massive they show the world\nAs I think that with a lot of young men um ... this idea like let me just show everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic intelligent smart horrible you know whatever their characters that they show and then there's that stuff's sometimes there's like people can handle this stuff people can handle knowing that\nI'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also in our society is that I respect for a man Who's Afraid who sad\nSome of our work is helping our young men have a safe place so that they can talk about the stuff that's really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens with a lot of my young men\nSo for you personally I mean what was the mask you grow up wearing and how did you adopted at what point did you realize that lets getting your way\nOh man I say middle schools where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I thought it was kind of smart but in middle school is not cool to be smart and so my ... was like getting\nSlide and buy whatever I don't care about this in order to do the homework because I didn't want to [noise]\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness you know my father died before I was born\nWe cry at too about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son from school where you do when you see your father come to back to school night we talk to about that like there would my friends couldn't you couldn't talk to them about it\nSo I just had to held it and I had to pretend like you didn't really exist", "year": "2018", "show_name": "To The Best of Our Knowledge", "city": "Nashville", "day": "10"}
