[noise] the website is living abroad in Japan dot com [noise] you grow up as a child of a missionary parents in I don't I was always curious about this it seems like when you have a spiritual vacuum people\nEmbrace hop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either ... or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she do has to do with\nSacredness and the president like ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival it might be Buddhist it might be shouldn't do it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers here you said\nSixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought it had sent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred [laughter] but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionaries such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and exclude the other religions\nI saw and as a missionary you'd have to do that sometime nor the gods before me or or this sort of the right yes is\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kind of like sure that sounds good out all embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so that would that's right they would take on Christianity but but it wouldn't be the only religion\nRuthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure that's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what his Buddhism and what is Hindu as I Am and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally shaking do means the way up the gods it's a type of ... or the belief in the sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings too that God that helped God of agriculture for example so there are no images inch into like statues are idols or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the amber who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state of the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and missed that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals that sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacred ... making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheet do and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk and then on New Year's\nAnd you know like a whole each time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging this gong what a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of sense that you may have committed to it at temple down very slowly hundred and eight times [noise] and then as soon as midnight passed on New Year's morning\nPeople flock to the Shinto shrine to pray for health and success and\nI'm happy new year and by analysts\nOr even something to put in your car for tracking safety and so on at the sheep they'll try so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she do for the new year\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you can make in your book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and routine when we're thinking about living in Japan\nIn public in the workplace and so on and on the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes then they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true anymore\nSo there isn't any changing yes so the younger generation has has pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to call them on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\n[noise] our phone number is eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from my mom's from Georgia he's got thanks for your call Hi Ray how're you I'm great to have you had to experience yourself in Japan\nYes I was there for about six years um I Lived in rural Japan and most of the time so it was much different than Louis you experience in Tokyo\nOr and what was your experience like were you doing for your work\nI was working as a teacher for the University of Maryland um and I taught at a military base and it was clearly Japan uh and I lived probably about Fifteen ... from the base and spent most of my time in the local economy\nAnd then I was teaching part-time down in Tokyo and my I was teaching English to a group of farmers\nSo I Would get on the train to nights a week and the little rickety train local try down to Tokyo and teach a group of about a pharmacist for several years and I developed a really intimate relationship as people down there\nAnd it really opened a lot of doors to have that close friendship with them and they were the ones that taught me all the Japanese basically I ever learn\nSo you were able to break into the society as a foreigner and make real friendships with the locals\nI did and it was amazing that was true things that I did one of them was learn Japanese torture Ruthie alluded to\nWhich opens a lot of doors people are really really friendly once you at least make an effort and the other one was I tackled the transportation problem\nI didn't really want to buy a car because very expensive to buy a car very hard so I bought an extremely small motorcycle little fifty she she motorcycle but a maximum speed limit in Japan is about thirty five miles an hour so every weekend I Would take off with another friend and we would go exploring someplace\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nTV viewers in the U.S have long enjoyed many British produced and dramas mysteries and comedies and more on the way\nThey've taken let's do a seaside being beat from hell and faulty towers shown a small town Cornwall Doc Martin working class struggles month coordination street changes in society on Downton Abbey and even a peek into the palace theories like Elizabeth end\nAnd even though most of the theories are fictional many use real like places backdrops settings places that fans can actually visit

living room on British TV show really And Julian thanks for joining us pleasure to be again so you lived as you watch it on TV before we ever get it and it's just in your backyard you can up on a train them get there and a couple\nOf hours when you think about all of the wonderful dimensions of Britain and England in particular that are shared on television especially these days are what comes to mind if you're a traveler going be England what should you know about in in in what you want to see\nWhat was so many places that are included in these TV shows um there's lots of information on the Internet if you've got to but she can are interested in particular series you can often Chinese so um the information on the Internet to find where they're being filmed\nYour tour guide let's say somebody has ten days and they hire you to show you around England and just to see the greatest uh places made famous by you know Downton Abbey or whatever\nTend to not be with film to talk to our council a which is frequently open to the public will go since started to not be it's often booked two to three years you know drones so there's loads of these places that\nCould be a disappointment is that you want to go to you'd think you can go to ...\nIs very difficult that's looking then yeah and then if you're a Doc Martin fan oh that's easy that you just try to pull ties up\nAnd down in Cornwall in the ... yeah and you can clamor there with all the other crowds to see the schoolhouse and the doctors houses that are running and the pharmacy or the chemist as we could be prepared to pay to park and walk quite a long ways to get into the town\nAnd it's not that bad as it is how would it not crowded yeah it's a lot of people there and the people are just thrilled that go there yeah I was there last year and they were filming so we were able to watch\nThis very organized that with with the filming going on and it just keeps everyone that can make sure that you don't get in the way I see I was just filming where they were deployed they did pull dark a little while and it was the only thing I Love old arguments so beautiful and uh\nI don't have quite the stage presence that

midsummer motives they use all this beautiful quaint little countryside with the villages and things for them didn't\nJames Harriet kind of hell yeah hell saying exactly yeah so that is a beautiful

shooting on location in London\nLots of Harry Potter locations\nOkay so you're on the Harry Potter crowd let's say you're traveling with your kids and they're really into Harry Potter what are you going to be sure to see\nWhat you take them to obviously kings gross to platform nine to three cool says what do you find there\nYou'd see a platform nine and three quarters and you're obviously not

for me to exist on the normal train station so you go there and you just kinda go straight through the ...\nYeah the luggage ... and there has to talk with them with ... that they throw it around your neck and so it looks like you're going through the wool\nOver these sites I mean if you go if you're a doctor who find for instance it was all filmed in ... and ... and the whole sort of tourists and business based on the locations used in do through that I'm not sure if he filmed on the east side and wherever you are they really do their own very aware of\nThe value of these locations\nSo they do cash in on that from a tourism bones just using their big doctor who thing in cartoons 'cause I was in the new harbor in kind of like everybody was there for doctor who that's right if you're a doctor
