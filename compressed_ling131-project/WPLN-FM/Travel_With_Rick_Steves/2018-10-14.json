Australia's best loved actresses market deaths from DARPA is also starting to win the hearts of a growing fan base in America as the lead character in an addictive drama series set in the post war years of Nineteen fifties Australia\nA place to call home depicts a time when people down under started to take a second look at themselves and what Australia was to become as a nation\nMarket shares with us some of her favorite things about her home town of Sydney and I see getaways she enjoys including places which still might look\nA lot like they did back in the Nineteen fifties that's ingested let's open today's travel with Rick Steves with a return visit from a pilot pilot who's written poetic laid out the marble of modern aviation\nMark van hunter's book is called sky fearing and he joins us now for a view from the pilot's seat mark welcome back I'm happy to be here you have to be smart to fly a seven forty seven\nWell there's a pretty rigorous um assessment process you know it starts with a whole series of tests and of course we're we're tested on you know every six months for in a simulator there's these amazing full motion simulators which are\nYou know not much less expensive than an airplane in some cases and so there's definitely a a huge amount of training obviously there's qualifications which are required and\nAnd I don't think there are many professions that have that much a recurring a lifetime of nations and and training\nWhat's the most demanding thing for you intellectually about flying\nI was really amazed by a system called inertial navigation which is\nKind of what existed before GPS and in some ways it's cooler than just ask because GPS requires the ability to see you have a line of sight to the satellites whereas in ... just knows it doesn't need to look at anything that has these great terms like transport rate and coasting and gravitational actors and earth frame and\nHarmonic expansions and it was pretty rigorous stuff but there's a certain poetry to those words have fallen on the spot to be able to learn them\nOr their lounges where you ever find yourself in a social group with six or eight other pilots if so what do you talk about\nWell a inevitably we talk about our plans [laughter] um but we also you know we also talked about uh about our interest in Africa for on a on a long stay somewhere sometimes one of my big things that I like to do is get out of town a little pet me to go to you know we flight of the biggest cities in the world the chorus but I always like to get out if there's a village nearby they can get you by train\nYeah from reading your book I got the sense that there's a sort of a pride you are a seven forty seven guy used to fly an Airbus and now you're flying seven forty seven\nWell I I I Love my ears on the Airbus but the seven forty seven was the plane to capture my imagination when I was a kid like when I was a five year old or six year old or seven year old that was the plane that you know represented me everything that airliners and also in terms of being able to move around the planet in a way that previous generations are unable\n\n\n\n\nAudiences in the United states are beginning to recognize what Australians have known for years that actress ... is a delight to watch both on\nStage and on screen\nShe also seems to be one of Australia's busiest actors right now she's starting at three newly released TV drama series she plays the title role or a high powered attorney and two seasons of Janet came and she has a leading role in the jak Irish detective shows\nBut starring in the parish drama series a place to call home is what's building her international following the series is set in rural Australia in the fall of to push for Nineteen fifties\nThe episodes explore the Arabs developing issues of national identity and prejudices Martin's character nurse Sarah Adams returns home to Australia from Europe after surviving the horrors of a Nazi prison camp\nWe caught up with Martin between filming day to the BBC Studios in Sydney to find out more about her role in a place to come home and also what she enjoys most about Australia today mark ... welcome to travel with Rick Steves\nThanks for having me\nWell congratulations on your six staff to understand a place to call home is a huge hit in Australia and now it's getting more and more airtime on public television in the United states\nTo lately it's got a huge fan base and America there's all sorts of\nFacebook pages and Twitter and ... and the fans have had a huge influence actually making the shed continue certainly in this country but I found out yesterday it sell it to a hundred and twenty countries around the world\nA place to call home and it it really gives us a look at at Nineteen fifties Australia you know we've in the United states were coming out for this a frenzy about Downton Abbey which takes us intimately into this fascinating world of English aristocracy a century ago\nYou're a series takes us to Australia in the in the age we think of as Eisenhower and leave it to beaver and sort of the that we have enough to objects simplistic looks the Nineteen fifties but sort of peeling back the layers tell us about Australia in the night\nFor us that's how we define it so there was a depression um people who are returning or not so there was a lot of loss a lot of shrapnel emotional shrapnel in people's psyche is\nA lot of them in a disappeared and say the women had sort of taken ... found a better place for themselves in society and community in the workplace\nAnd it was a time of reconnecting to cultural identity I suppose there wasn't a lot of frivolous he and a celebration necessarily even though it was his seeming success um because the last restaurant in suicide great\nSo the show starts with a woman returning from either say my character than atoms having being away from home for a long time and she had fought in the wall and being a Holocaust survivor and that's all explained it in the show as to how that could possibly happen to her and she mates this\nVery well to do family on the ship on the way back in accidently fools madly in love with the um the son who\nWho of course it's not the right match and should never bay and saw a war begins outside the war between this family and this woman\nIt's really a look at where we've Bain and how far we've come about what I Love about this show and back in late to create what he's done he's said as a melodrama anti talks about um\nThe ... films so he's referencing a particular genre and so it's quite heightened but it's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice\nAnd racism and and the phobia and um the such as to the subjects that we haven't really explored on a train and television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt's sort of disarmed us to go back to the fifties and look at it and how how was dealt with in that time and then the sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute or two about the whole idea of the adjustment for us inside the where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected and at the same time expect more\nIn the same time I had that sense when I saw you even when you were stealing from Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is a new age and women are going to be respected\nThat's what I had always been very family based women in the kitchen men out to work it really had begun that way for a very very long time and as I say much the men left\nSo the women have to fill those roles that were pushed out in the kitchen and into the workforce\nThe thing about Sarah she comes way they'll say Europe and surviving a robin's broke with last year was incarcerated for either three is she's in us by trade and had continued up to ... ... s in London and here's a woman who\nWho really doesn't need to be the center of attention and yet her actions\nKeep putting her in the spotlight because she's selfless but she\nShe marches for the greater good and so I really enjoyed playing that an ruffling all the fed is of course which are in the hats updates amazing costumes and the Nineteen fifties\nAnd there's a lot of fun to be had out of it too it sounds very depressing but actually there's a lot of joy in watching that happen as someone breaks down the walls side to stay home you have grain\nAt a time when you can't pick up a ... or send a text you have to arrive and actually have a conversation which usually means a cup of tea and Symantec biscuits switch off one of our nation's greatest biscuits um\nMade from the ... of them I send maple\nI mean certainly when I shoot it\nI can smell my grandmother and I can hear her voice and I can hear the radio and I remember the left over that time the kind of lost vestige of that\nAnd certainly it talked to a lot of his tribe in 'em and internationally as well it'd be like down to not be because it is it's a fool absorption in another place and it's like a different world\nUm it's like traveling when I traveled to Japan I this is like being on another planet I Love it so much because it's so different and so completely other and that's what they should really is\nAnd it's just beautifully written and delicious loomed and and wonderful acting uh do you think that a lot of us it's a hit in Australia in part because Australians are just a story about the fifties or does it a challenge them to see where they are today and then and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what's so unique about this show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire then sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it there's there's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognize for everyone\nWhat a delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because this can verbalize or or help them visualize this reality and it also artfully deals with a lot of the dark side of a sort of a sweet superficial world that really need to be dealt with thoughtfully\nAbsolutely I'm slightly this has traveled to recuse we're talking with mark ... she's pretty sure Adam's in a place to go home begin in Australia and it's come to the United states on public television and you can watch it screaming on a corn media\nFor number's eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and ... calling from Atlanta Georgia said thanks for your call thank you do you have a comment or thought about um a place to go home or Australia in the fifties for murder\nFirst I Want to say how much my family is enjoying hurt nuance a performance in a place to call home it it is one of our favorites and\nI'm as a southern uh American uh in in the southeastern part of of our country\nI Can't help but be struck by how beautiful the country is and how the the rolling hills are ... are are part of the landscape and and certainly part of the enjoyment one has seen these actors\nUm I'm also just as a southerner interested in\nMartha's reaction to how an American traveler to Australia should\nEngage in the aboriginal history which is so so much a foundation of the country\nThings said on the way to come to us try to to engage with the indigenous community to such dice communities out and one of the places to do that of course is in the red Santa [noise]\nUh if you go to a place called ... which in the old days as cold as rock um but it's been renamed it tap original name\n\n... on the line with us from Sydney, Australia for a look at her favorite places for get away in her home country she's just finishing up Domingo fourth season the drama series a place to call home where she plays the role of Sarah Adam even though it was a top\nRated drama on Australian Shepherd network it was cancelled during the second season but you are in demand convinced Fox television to pick it up so the storyline continues and she's three and four now showing on a number of public TV stations here in the usa\nAll seasons in a place to go home plus marches other drama series are also available at acorn t._v. Erika calling from beaver creek and Ohio Erica thanks for your call\nHigh rag thank you for taking my call high Marta on Eric I\nWant to say you're you're making the reminisce about my trip from last January and she happened to well I came over for the New Year's eve fireworks age or a glorious ... did\nNot want to come home and I did the French fries style\nTell us about this bridge and ... without being I'm too obvious New Year's Eve in Sydney, Australia is the middle of the summer so it's nice not everybody's on on the beach coming over the bridge what's it like Erica\nIt was the last ... fearing it takes rarely three and a half hours from start to finish extremely well organized\nOn how the group has no more than fourteen and um they check you out I think it's every half hour hour and he'll go along with a certain way to our guy\nFrom your vantage point give you some history of the city and at the bridge it all on another little bit south again and they take your photo at various points and um\nAre you actually really or you roped up yes [laughter] Oh yes you are saying\nOh this is like a veal set out to one of those uh cable ways where you've got the Caribbean or Z and you've got two of 'em and you go from linked to link is that right\nMhm and then you get to the top fail we'll take your photo and craft or the other side of the project will come back down while the other side so yeah\nSo I don't know anything about that and it took about three and a half hours and you do with a guide and small group and if you pass out you can't get hurt because you're harnessed and your your hitched to that cable right because what you just like a sack of potatoes dangling from that cable and your guide well then slide you to the point [laughter]\nAnd I actually had because I asked them about their liability insurance and they said they didn't say ... ...\nYeah well now you go to that that if if you've got to guide to make sure you're harnesses on right and you you have to care of billionaires and put them into metal cable so it's still probably ah one of the great thrills that you could possibly have passed a tourist and that's the thing to check out while you're in the\nThey also do a breath test just so you know [laughter]\nThe window [laughter] well [laughter]\nI think for everyone else that'd be good but no it certainly they check I Want to know what's been drinking a little feeling like they're much you know and you can't have anything in your pocket using that ride Erich just in case they fall off the bridge onto the traffic flow\nThat's correct there are only five items people take I can only do it three of them are and like if you're an asthmatic like your guy will take your spray and their little fanny pack\nSo what's the name of that bridge again I've got a check this out more what is the bridge the Sydney how the bridge to Sydney harbor bridge here or two while you were there did you enjoy Australia Day we happen to be there for them you\nKnow and that was my question I had an opportunity to possibly go kill or not there and for the whole thing and January and it would be there for ... like I Want to know if there's a traditionally to celebrate or in any professional\nThere certainly is is always an indigenous ceremony which is called survival day and uh usually this great speeches wonderful traditional music food and celebration\nSo that's in any city and Sydney Melbourne that'll be happening publicly said square it's cold which is very close to the state and I've been steady and taking the idea\nIs that on the same day every year yes it is the twenty six January January twenty six haircut are you a fan of uh a place to go home it's been watching the series\nI got a subscription to acorn t._v. jak so I could watch that show\nAnd and what what what do you like it out I mean it it it sounds like it's an addictive show or what do you enjoy about it\nI Love period pieces for instance for now and I'm asked said mentioned earlier just the performances and they and they do have our topics that you wouldn't\nNecessarily think they would cover straight out for that so now that love triangle and just I'm a social mores at the time that you reflecting on how far we may or may not have confidence and he's\nJust great haircut thanks so much for your call\nI think yeah OK in the\nTrain cars are rushing yet [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves who've been talking with mark ... up and she's the has the lead role the beloved Sarah Adams in a place to call home and more to you know we're all thinking about sitting here but if you want to take a little break from Sydney or what's your favorite place to travel in Australia and why\nMy favorite places test mania um it's a tiny little island on the bottom of the state yeah\nFrom there so I'm I've been going now with the ... saying is it's still going to the old sandstone buildings from the comeback days\nIt's I'm not very far you can drive forty minutes Mike and you're in the most incredible\nSeaside town of seeking it and Franklin historically they're incredibly rich they've got apples that will explode in your mouth they uh they have ... different types of Apple's it's sort of called the apple ... for that reason and\nThe food the the people that calmness um if you can imagine it calmer than it's dry there already is it has its own special piece and it's much cold down there so it's very crisp and very alive it has some of the most beautiful national pox I think in the world\nAnd you can walk them uh the cradle mountain walk and the able testament walk along the coast you can do them via companies say stay in hot and the whole way which is pretty nice or you can free will get yourself um but they really out world\nHeritage walks and um it's just it's one of the most beautiful places I think I guess the thing ...\nAnd it sounds just and chanting\nNow if I'm if I'm a big fan of ... old fashioned liquid Australia from the Nineteen fifties because I start getting into a place to go home and it inspires me to go to Australia and\nTry to find a quiet Eddie from the past are there any places in Australia where you might feel like you're back in the Nineteen fifties maybe in\nSmall towns along the way um but not really in the major cities on the rocks obviously and Sydney which is where the ... bridge is\nIs maintained and has historical walks we can hear the history of each building and how it was built and against the sandstone and the convicts\nBut for me what a stray really has to offer is in nature\nAnd often these communities that we've been talking about like for example there's a place called ... which is at Cape ... on the west coast of strata right up the top it's a\nAn indigenous run place that you can go and it has five star tents and then to stop hot so it fits everyone's brave\nAnd it takes a day to drive there or you can fly there on a small airplane and that really gives you an idea of the remoteness of Australia and how isolated in lifted learn it really is to the rest of the world\nAnd to me that the Eddie you're looking for when you come to this place yeah convey\nIt can be a place of complete solitude which when I go to America I Know they also have places like that\nBut I'm In Australia that they seem almost like you're the only person in their ... lay in as many as a place called blind glass by that you can walk into an arm and at the time me and my husband went in there was absolutely nobody that so we went skinny dipping water\nAnd I don't I didn't really these\nJust extraordinary and um and not far from\nA major hub where you can have a beautiful meal in some delicious wine so um I think you're less searching for the Nineteen fifties and more things with that timeless place that I feel like you've got a stranger officer\nCompliment your time in Sydney with the bat dimension of the great vastness and peaceful and I do have some Australian\nSome guys are right he will mark ... got me bad news I think about Australia thanks so much for uh an appreciation of Australia as well as an insight into your work is sever Adams in a place to go home my pleasure thanks for having me", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "14"}
