didn't [noise]\nLet's start the hour planning a dusty road trip in search of what remains at the wild west for it all disappear ghost towns can be kind of scary in a band falling apart\nOthers have been turned into tourist attractions with nice courting being be fighting restaurants in in historic atmosphere for buying souvenirs weekend out of town\nThey're found all across the western United States these days and their towns that how ever briefly had their moment in this and\nMany are fading away\nJimmy ... visited lots of the east coast towns in his coauthors ghost towns of the west to highlight their historic appeal in the atmosphere they provide for people with a curiosity for the forgotten by ways of the Old West\nJim thanks for being here\nYou bet so these ghost towns are kinda like\nStages for imagining the legendary wild west what\nIs the fun of going to a ghost town for you\nWhen I was growing up with a lot of kids I fell in love with stories of of discoveries of Bob King Tut's tomb and things like this and these old towns and\nYou can unleash the imagination and I was fortunate as a kid we moved out to Arizona in Nineteen sixty six and a I had an opportunity to grow up in here stories from some of the people who lived in these places and it really inspired a passion\nAnd especially for people our age I mean we grew up watching wider than the rifleman radio and boy you walk through a ghost town and you can almost imagine doc holiday stepping around the corner lots\nOf history in these places and it's amazing that there's so many times how quickly they boomed how quickly they faded a lot of them never monitored more than just literally a tent city\nBut others saw like Ryder light was all modern prosperous community\nSo around like was the town that wasn't even as old as a lot of towns that that I Would think of as ghost towns it began what Nineteen oh five\nYeah Nineteen five Nineteen six mhm\nNow that's in Nevada kind of east of Death Valley and why it was around lights suddenly this boom town of what happened that that helped it what it is a five thousand people in all of a sudden\nWhy watch one of my favorites and it's one of the most photographed sites in the southwest ghost towns and because of easy access it's it's easy to get to just off state highway three Seventy four\nIt went from literally being just a couple of prospectors intense and within a few years they had a modern bank buildings with a marble floors elevators three cities swimming pools a train depot that was service by three different railroads and by Nineteen ten eleven twelve it was gone\nSo there was all based on a mind somebody struck it rich and the mind and everybody went there and they made a little money but then it was overbuilt and whether it's you said that the population picked at five thousand and uh within twelve months that dropped below one thousand by Nineteen twenty almost nobody live there\n[noise]\nAnd\nIn Ireland they said you'll never forget someone if you write a song about [noise]\nThe Irish remember the events and the pizza sheets their history and the many traditional songs written over the years for lyrical look at some of the heroes of Ireland some real in some legendary we're joined now by singer Kathy right\nCat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of public environment she's with us right now and travel with Rick Steves to introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remembers in a song Kathy so good to have you here\nIt is great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of\nJust a joy of lights in the context of Ireland no music ties in with that and I also remember you grew up in Detroit yes Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom my father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician a harsh so she always had music on the stereo playing chopping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down and also we were members of the gay the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit\nAnd that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven\nFor my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that sessions singing sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing songs and people don't know that about Detroit it's a it's kind of very very strong Irish population\nHad a bit of Ireland in Detroit\nAbsolutely and then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchens no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off\nEverything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience as a kid\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like higher\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it's things to something larger disparate it Boyd the spirits of the Irish who have left to this\nOther countries to go fight in foreign wars it also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive around Ireland as a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added\nTo I don't want people to run off the bus throw me off of us but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate and historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs their songs about greed horses there are songs about people's families there are songs about deaths\nIn communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nHeartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began to have your relationship with England and it's just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries yes you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there was a civil war about how everyone's going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who's side are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal that was like the American revolution and ... street just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that's stir your Irish patriotism more pride\nAnd even better than that because some of the men and women who were actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote these songs and I'd like to sing one free now if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by ... appears Patrick Henry peers this one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful sunny took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people Greece O'Malley who was the pirate queen environment born and Fifteen thirty she was the chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she sang she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnocked people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own heroes so\nShade ... Iraq who they need to you\nKnow it's you know\nShe had done or all shed on how are ya oh no she I don't\nKnow\nThat's just one diverse\nSo the Irish are going to save themselves yes and they're going to do it's become Gaelic\nYes it's going to be the Gales not the French or the stash and it's going to be gray so now the and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring with the planting of that seat he says in the last verse of the sun we may not live a week after this right and they barely did we may not live a week after this but in summer will be the bloom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the ... the Ira yes spreading out I'm gathers tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland yeah ship which is actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely this is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America by Ayman devil there to bring back too\nAlso a lot of the musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant fiddle player changed the way Irish people play the fiddle his label what's called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland\n[noise] this is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy Ryan she's been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years [noise] performer and ensembles like church the ladies and she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist of the decade or two times by live Ireland dot com [noise]\nThat was born in Detroit now she goes Ireland county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums and her performance scheduler on her website and that's Cathy Ryan dot\nNow when we think about Ireland it's also a proud\nCulture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent and I understand that the first printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for everyone to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most accepted\nIt was Thomas Davis who is one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression he was a Protestant as well\nSome people listening might think oh it's between Catholics and Protestants knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be its own nation but he wrote songs and he believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are extant they still exist were still singing them\nThey keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up in that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland uh singers and musicians that it's not about off\nIt's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June and we are serving it now if it was a great song or tune it was there before us and it will be there after so we're just playing our part and continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear a street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner and they'll they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yeah there's a word and the thought that you've got poets who would put their poetry to music or something out of us don't realize is an extra dimension was a great Irish poets that might have been caught up in the music\nGates gates gates and I when I'm On the coach as a tour guide I've slain gates reciting his poetry because he sings as\nI say with the ...\nGoal now go to ... free and he's singing it you know you can hear the song in his voice the heat after\n\n\nIt's got all the makings of a tabloid headlines or an action movie the son of one of America's richest families travels to an exotic locale\nDisappears under mysterious circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by camp\nWas it true or did he grow\nAs the official reports clean\nJournalist Carl Hartman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller the Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one popping\nRetraced rocket covers German combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusion which he writes about in Savage sharpest a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael rocker colors tragic quest Carl good to have you back on the show\nThanks so much so did I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nNo question I mean now Michael graduate he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of criminal barred as it was called then a few years earlier and Mike was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and she determined to go to ask Matt and try to collect some as Matt art which he did he made a quick sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then uh went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go\nOn that trip he vanished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to the his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nWell I think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was a young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around\nOur you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball [noise] and um you know some of the greatest start of of the world\nKey was enamored of ... and fascinated by asthmatic culture and asked met carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high up polls kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he a you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd this is in New guinea this is a huge island down them between Thailand and Indonesia is one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies and that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top and with the Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee waltzing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one as Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and ah\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence of which the art was all a part in a you know and and head hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting was also some cannibalism and\nMichael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong\nTime and you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society where one of\nThe great ironies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents the most powerful family in the most powerful country in the world in in ads mad at the crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power and\nThe head hunting and you know when the as men men who killed them did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pass the ...\nThey consume them and there's no more\nArticulate display of of power than that\nSo did they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nNo they didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them\nI mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify as mad in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed\nIn a local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village a lesson as he wrote in his reports and he\nWas afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with and then he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary a you know traditional place a place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and\nThat left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was a ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the man's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned\nOut so he gave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world Pete did\nCarl Hofmann spin on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report today on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller as he investigated his disappearance end that deadly clash between cultures in the jungles of New Guinea his book is called Savage\nHarvest [noise] now I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on kind of listen it's fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party it's a matter of um power and symbolism is that right\nYeah it's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything on it was easier to get an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well I mean it rarely will this theory somebody\nYeah it gets very complex but you know cannibalism is with in a is a sacred to act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual let's stick way to actually cook the person\nYes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the book\nThe Rockefeller family are maintained that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nWhen he was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael a sad you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRenee watts thing was older and wiser said you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately and\nA fairly sophisticated search for I'm In no trace them was ever found so it was natural to assume that he had disappear and of course Renee had seen him swim off that he disappeared at sea but as it turned out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
