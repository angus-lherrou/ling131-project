Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation and against spoiler alert here since anyone who's never see for me and Juliet or instead of stabbing herself at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\nIn order to kill his which kinda tones are into because that's how again sport or sorry\nUh that's how clear Patrick dollars at the end of Antony and Cleopatra so it's this kind of wonderfully ... reimagining of the plate and one that pact out houses the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on ... in a fledgling city I'm On bass and you know I think it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East Africa in cities even in this in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson Lee He's a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili land in\nSearch of a global poet Edward is it safe\nTo say I mean your focus is East Africa but would this be\nEast Africa as an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and we're going to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\n... they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia Japan\nAnd China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different periods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways he used as this kind of um ... ... to protect the explorers he's used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Swahili language\nThat is now a spoken by a hundred million people he's translated into Swahili he's you know he's performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flash points\nThese countries in the off them off of ... want to be open to the culture of the people who had been colonial over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to but it's one which hopefully capture\nAs a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda parts of the Congo along the way in which Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also is the region was government as a kind of a single entity by the British colonies so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices and mission raised landed on the coast which is west what he has spoken Swahili is\nKind of very Arabic influenced bound to language and as the colonial governments moved inland and ah they would damned if they were going to speak I learned more than one language so they made everyone else learns why he has they moved in line for\nMe is just happens to be a convenient language for the colonial overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is a legacy of colonialism but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created a shed culture between all of the African culture within one of these countries in East Africa\n... now you talked about uh the missionaries using Shakespeare's what Nineteen century missionaries and checks for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in the story is a chest cold at would stare who was the ... the mission ... Central Africa sent out from Britain\nHe arrives in Zanzibar in Eighteen sixty seven and he is a missionary in his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity but he sees as central to listen to create electricity so he actually spends a lot of the time\nTrying to understand local culture is translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things printed in Swahili\nHe is a translation off the shelf and Mary lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational taxed for schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania to almost a century off to that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their faith and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of the missionaries culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a ... a you believe that won gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had\nAccess to a kind of universal notions of beauty the allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you want if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate\nHey that's one more reason or he could be the global poet he talked in universal terms of beauty and love and humanity\nMore than a decade exploring Iceland and focusing especially on a cyber music scene he's fall\nKevin at a team from key XP radio in Seattle head to Reykjavik to broadcast live from the Iceland Airwaves music festival\nPool has traveled to each corner the island nation and has made many local friends stopping their studio now to share his passion for one of the hottest traveled destination to anywhere these days and it's music scene Kevin thanks for joining us thanks so much for having me Rick appreciate that of all places to take a\nRadio crew to broadcast live why would you choose Iceland and white be gone back for so many years in a row one\nReason is they have an incredible music scene it's amazing a little history on K XP were a Seattle based radio station with a global audience and we're committed to finding a discovery in great music no matter where it's being created\nWe had been going to music festivals in the United states like south by southwest in Austin, Texas and see I'm Jay in New York City but to the first trip to Iceland as a station I really wanted to make a point that ah that Kay XP would travel to the\nFarthest corners of the earth to find a great music to share with our listeners worldwide really you know music is like travel in a way to write and our belief is that if we can harness the emotional power music and bring people together\nAnd helps create a more tolerant and understanding world as we get to have those experiences through music and get to understand each other through various different types of music and uh you come to realize that the world is a lot smaller place a then sometimes we think it is even when it's\nAway and there are different dimensions of cultures that you can use as your entree into a more intimate connection with that culture can be cuisine that can be art\nIt can be music absolutely and a music certainly it's almost a cliche but it's international language you can sit in a pub in Ireland or or I suppose in a small concert hall in in Reykjavik and feel like you're celebrating the same thing with local people absolutely and I and I think that's part of what drives K X. P.\nCertainly need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark some times I've been in in traditional music sessions and Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I Walk out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really\nYeah transformational as is such a a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kinds of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch different places but there was a band called secret rows and they uh had an album called I'll get to ... that\nWas so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was it it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music fair or Greek I wanted to go to the fjord\nAnd look at the view where his cabin was when he was inspired to write that you have the music is sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it and you want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed\nYes music and sometimes it inside travel okay so you're organizing is now in a sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back\n[laughter] oh you didn't want to go back because he thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yet because I go back with a TV crew and it's like where's the magic I was your last year was incredible do it again yeah sometimes it doesn't so\nI did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of Iceland on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel if you're in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up\nCulminating in us actually going to Iceland and broadcasting live and I had to do a scouting locations trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now and every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back and broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together and nice like\nWell it's a bit of both the music fest we broadcast from its called Iceland airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic inorganic bans new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries along with a beautifully curated selection of international bands sevens and gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now though musically because of the Internet is\nWere all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally\n... that's a a boon for music culture it internationally and it's probably fair benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage\nSome land the firing punches way above its weight as a source for innovative contemporary music our guest right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ... he's the program director of Seattle\nCan a music post on weekday afternoon ...\nKevin sharing what he travels to that Iceland Airwaves festival every November in Reykjavik here why did many bands and musicians are up to each year you'll find links to the festival him to Kevin radio show Rick Steves dot com slash radio\n[noise]\nKevin when we're talking about this listener's experienced is his attendees experience this music appreciation experience\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences in pubs or in in wonderful beer gardens and so on but what is the venue like does that contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues and sometimes not even use a because any space that could be a cool place to host a band becomes one but they've got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is where\nAre all I've been there that's a matter of pride for Reykjavik it really is the concert hall studying right every Scandinavian capital seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall\nYeah I think all the stone is is volcanic Blackstone definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most literate nations uh I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere in or if it has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative genres\nAnd lots of creative people have you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase or because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year [laughter] what what is it about it that has so much creativity man that's a that is a great question\nAnd music journalist ... been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of Iceland on my show uh all of her grandson and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got geothermal energy and the the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset of Iceland is a creativity of the people\nAnd he sort of tied that into again the legacy where the lineage of the the saga is\nAnd how storytelling had to be a way that the history was told\nYou know dating back a thousand years and that sort of everyone was a story tower and he said that to art and culture in Iceland was really a democracy of culture in that everyone was encouraged to participate in at some point everybody had to by telling the stories right he related this to music and saying that\nYou know everybody can create music and if you have something valuable to contribute it will be embraced and by valuable to contribute he meant something new and different ...\nAnd you mix it in with the saga heritage yes when people had to do things in the oral tradition gifts and a music is the horse that the poetry rides on\nYes and and he sort of equated that era and to this ... why do it yourself culture right or that that they have the really reinforces just people participating and again are being created\nYou can celebrate this dimension of Iceland any time of year but the festival you're talking about is every year in early November right yes it's called ice on the airwaves I spent\nYet ... so that sort of like there's probably a an airline deal to get there for this\nYet is ... so the airline actually started the festival over a decade ago trying to solve a problem of how do we get people to Iceland when it's dark and winter", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
