farm in Wisconsin\nAnd do you still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before we get started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nAlthough I Am a bomb on them\nBut I Am a bomb on our way\nOne of the wave Carter proposed giving farmers and equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot of the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that's what we call those yeah there you go\nThis was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other\nSecurity risk and it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new is it it's one thing to provide stability is another to step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls is playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon SUV is going up because the government\nAnd do you you hear of it and you ... back your forehead boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would do it as bad as God but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... is going to work out so well\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone\nToday on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America farmer's wife buying milk loss of bill ... is the case study in what happens when price controls runs full feed into the realities of the market\nThere will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river\nAnd touching exchange between Martha Stewart\nAnd dogs are probably paying pretty fight government she don't buy you got me on a special [noise]\nWhen we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered milk we\nCan spend that stuff overseas as part of foreign aid but she's just doesn't travel well\nSo the government gave a bunch to schools than to the army but this was not\nSo they created a brand new special program to give the cheese the way through food bank\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New York City and say anybody wants to choose which\nOne you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as a government cheese because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great changed give away began today in California San Francisco was one of the three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this\nFootage is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed Rick sort of ... and at times with the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some black USDA stamps on it and he's\nA state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the cave full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military mess halls for\nA lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise]\nBack we're ready for you many listeners may remember Saturday Night live match fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nFarm here to study any government cheese and\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of songs\nThat we can possibly get a like a lot of them was something she\nMay be government she says most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff\nWith that [noise]\nWhere's the knife\nGovernment she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair was process cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than belt I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to them but I'm not ... but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural gender I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\n\nParents doing the dance ... doing the dance strength but here is why government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in ...\nAnd said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I Am a bomb on our way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well\nI think there's there's a two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the sucking the lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] when I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented very very expensive she's been to\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we can this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solutions and was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like\nHave people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every part of milk this old and we created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk and the ... mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension so these days if the government wants to help farmers don't generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes\nThe government has tended to stay away from buying cheese of pollution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the ADA farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again\nAnd then in August we learned some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distribute it to places like schools and food banks that'd be fair that's probably\nEnough to start filling caves which again but there is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government you [noise] to the
