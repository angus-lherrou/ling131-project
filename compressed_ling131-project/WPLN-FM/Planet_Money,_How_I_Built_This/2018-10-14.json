get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of started her with my my maybe we should say ah where are you [noise] Hi\nThis is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know if you're not going to get my name is yeah [laughter] that's probably the easy question I'm Catherine Rampell I'm watching\nThe civically Catherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that he was furious [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I can't see now I see [noise]\nHow much would\nTend on the board to eighty nine [noise]\nAre a little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay\nTax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it with Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's bees and service charges that seemed to appear out of\nThin air at check out and drive us all crazy booking rental cars buying concert tickets\nFor like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes there's an Internet fee sometimes there's a parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort\nWas ... by the way it with Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not opposition\nUh and the fact that companies do compete on ... did not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want it's like everyone has a used car so [laughter]\nI I have a very good friend who's a used car sales so I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak their would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop\nThe price should be the price\n[noise] that is how Catherine Rampell would make the world better with one simple week [noise]\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain Dan I'm Kenny Malone and\nSometimes on Planet Money we tackled the world's big questions foot today on the show we look for small dancers something we've done here before recalled the smartest people we know and we asked him\nCatch up rules yeah like guy you want to catch up on my stood on that guy just not that kind of catch up this is the kind where if you are losing you would like to catch up Steve can you give us\nWeb streaming is made possible by Lipscomb universities online degree offerings designed for ambitious learners students can earn a bachelors or masters degree yet their pace wherever they are learn more at Lipscomb dot edu slash on line\nThat inning in other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand we went back\nTo Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked us to catch up ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan\nHow much shorter with these games are better than the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be caught by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost an hour from a game at half an hour of the\nGame yes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance so\nHow have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well a critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there had been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact\nHe tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be the only Eighteen seconds at the end of the game\nHome like how you are a true iconoclast route [laughter] we'll see what happens\nWe don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't go to any

welcome back to how I built this from NPR I'm Guy rise so in the summer of Nineteen eighty four Gary and Samuel ends stony field are almost broke their basically running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part of hope and they had one store in Cambridge on prospects drink and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack bread and circus every other little natural food co-op and New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to ... in their TPP with their wet go you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in a hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do\nSo in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday at\nThe farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus I'm prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yogurt that was on a Sunday on\nWednesday Merrick Harold Skinner the buyer bread and circus called and said Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof were getting all kinds of requests for yoga get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about a month later we were her number one selling yogurt\nOr she took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles as last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference you get people's miles and then they're going\nTo ask for it and and this is a right around the time you meet Meg he would become your wife right yeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no for conference northeastern farming association conference in I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and or right after I finished my speech this very\nAdorable or organic farmer from New Jersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there\nI waited patiently to ask me a question well that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year wife Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state\nSo she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course that needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter] I started raising and I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase it so she increased to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm as 'cause they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mom\nWe worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened\nIn this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAt at this point I was a half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just this is became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom which was about fifty feet from my office I Would\nOn many occasions tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chat to see if I could borrow another thirty five hundred twenty five hundred to make ends\nMeet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law's fun and Meg was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well because she didn't have confidence and then\nThey will look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that the power would I mean we're on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere\nWas make thing do you listen to ditch this thing this bag it I mean or or did she gives it sounds like maybe she didn't believe in it well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in it did you think you know where you are what two three years into this thing\nAnd not only are you making money you are in debt big big time\nYeah well I'll say this I'm\nMeg or you know fortunately loved me even more fortunately probably love the yogurt and we had nowhere else to go [noise]\nYou know she had given up for a job down on her farm in New Jersey has signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but\nAs as a Lily Tomlin says it ... it it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened whatever well so now I'm going to jump a year and a half\nWe've now expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms wow and we have maxed out this little farm there is no\nYou cannot squeeze another drop of yogurt out of this place so
