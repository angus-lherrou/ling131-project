name and it looks like there's one final note here from Kenny if you're radically I ever needed someone to pretend to be the knowing caretaker\nReal foods but it's portable inconvenient but it tastes indulgent like shouldn't be eating it like junk junk food I mean I don't know that day at that moment\nIt was like this surge of energy I God I could feel this excitement over an idea it's not like I hadn't had ideas before I mean people are walking around every day with ideas for whatever reason and bad day in that time and all those little experiences that builds up and I I just felt and\nWhat you do did you like run home and and and in certain like in writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kinda mulling over for all for a while\nSo I ran down the mountain I got a new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver\nThought how can I take ... nuts and spices and and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies and cakes and I think okay\nHow do I take cherry pie and make it just in my quizzing are basically a raw raw and processed food and make it tastes like cherry pie or apple\nPie or banana bread or what have you\nSo I'm just imagining those because I Do a lot of cooking I'm and you're in your kitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like not just in there and you're going to get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like [noise] like ...\nAnd then you would like to get out with your hands in like a roll it out with a rolling\nTen and then um I got to cut her and I would like a guide her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I mean did you have any cash to just to sort of ask your parts to help you out in that year while you were not you know we're getting salary how did you pay your bills um\nWithin about a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought\nI'm gonna start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know so whole foods opened their first store in Denver\nAt exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up and they in in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought\nI'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made\nSo at what point did you think to yourself this is really going to be the big deal like this people are gonna want one by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say\nI Would buy those and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world I mean to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or shy\nAnd just just to clarify again our you just like sort of funding\nThat's been like finding reading and stuff and this is when you're using your own money and you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really\nGung ho and I would get all kinds of great information in a month we'd go by and I would find out about a piece of manufacturing equipment or just little things\nAnd I would be still motivated it's somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little Ziploc bags and their little Chinese takeout box and and I would\nThey would pay me like twenty two dollars for a box of bars and I would think wow and then another month to go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud\nAnd then I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea phase and when I actually want\nI'm trying to figure out how you uh maintained your your optimism and confident about all this because I mean you're thirty two you're divorced\nAnd I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of this plan and and I will like was part of you I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you in ... I think I had a little rushed to this kind of weird side project\nA lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they ... they're they're already climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh\nI Know you've worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments with people were ... I Would notice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise]\nWhen\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen projects [noise] into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and [noise] backed\nBy popular demand it's time for another sound opinions Halloween spook secular we scoured the dark underbelly of rock and roll defined more creepy to is for the season plus we'll find what songs give you the Hebei GB this week on sound opinions [noise]\nTonight at seven o'clock [noise]\n\nOn the next radiolab state police cars parked almost is more story of a serial killer of killed before and I'll kill again many deputy standing by his rights lawyer people saying how can live with yourself Gabby ... going to go on a justice body's used as pawns in a game of law\nIn a dangerous secret that set a precedent the conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do\nThat's on the next radiolab tonight at eight o'clock\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learned more it Raymond James dot com\nAnd from Tara data working to transform how businesses work through the power of data using pervasive data intelligence Tara data leverage is all relevant data to deliver answers to come\nCome it will come back\nTo how I built this from NPR I'm Kyrah so it's two thousand one large American is working at whole foods in Denver and she's trying to figure out how to start a company but you don't have a whole lot of money and she doesn't have any professional equipment\nOr even a way to process and package her energy bars so eventually I went to a packaging company in Denver and they weren't even taken me seriously engage them he said hey how do I make this them in a bigger scale what\nI said I Need packaging and then they they look at me and go huh I mean they could take me seriously didn't even have a business\nYou want it you were looking for somebody to ... who had food great packaging that package or bar shifts and and meanwhile back at home you're you're still using\nA Cuisinart yes it was used in the ... and I was trying to find a giant Cuisinart I was trying to ...\nI didn't even know what that was called it's called the vertical cutter mixture I learned and [laughter] and then that led to some guy that had a piece of manufacturing equipment that low and behold was the exact\nThing that I needed that the the the ... and that's how it all kind of piece together yeah\nAnd and by the way you can raise some money now I had raised any money and raise any okay or ... I wrote a story I wrote a business plan my dad helped me write a business plan I had a few friends and family interested and\nI was going to launch in fall of two thousand two [noise] and that got delayed until April of two thousand three [noise] and during that time all of my interested friends and family\nBacked out they because they got called the face it was yeah yeah it was just getting to late so\nWould you do well I had to had to raise the money and my dad had decided he would let he wanted to get involved in the company and he called me one day and he said hey would you\nWould you want a business partner and then how much money did you decide that you needed to raise I think we came up to the amount because I had\nTo print packaging and we had five flavors that I was launching\nWith and there was a minimum print run if all of those and I actually printed\nI'm at this company in Minnesota and I remember it costing somewhere around ... you know a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nBut how did you then find the stores to to buy and then ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Planet Money, How I Built This", "city": "Nashville", "day": "28"}
