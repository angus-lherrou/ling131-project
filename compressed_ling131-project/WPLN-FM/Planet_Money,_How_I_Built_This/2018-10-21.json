of water\nWhoa that's high stakes you're dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake they've used against around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds\nMonday Tommy was hanging out with the fan\nWhen he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um [noise] you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid in case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\nTommy's friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he's after Tommy Page sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counterproductive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things online like supplement\nComputing bleep bleep bleep bleep whatever it's going to take a while it's reading like a hundred and Seventy seven reviews would take me like five hours at any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noone in ...\nIt's his website flagged about these iPhone cable reviews of him\nSo for this product we see that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese views of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average ... their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one\nIssue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example the\nCourt is very tough and doesn't bend like the chords do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise] uh\nYeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that\nWay [laughter] well seven people also say they performed their duty with honor and respect there is the correct versus [laughter]\nYeah so Tommy software ran about a dozen different cats than I Am phone cable reviews and his reports it out and adjusted invading\nA so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying ... only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they leave you say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what you ask the iPhone cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills pissed\nOff course reached out to Amazon and about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they send us an extensive statement about it\nIf you met itself admits that they do not have the\nHealthy things you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even said with high confidence whether a review is fake according\nTo what Amazon saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural\nFor Amazon that as a problem we have hundreds of millions of views on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are inauthentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake viewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust that big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products right\nLike it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site that\nJust too many fake biggie sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just give up on the Internet shopping\nAnd we'll go back to ... ...

five\nThree years after Iran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner Lou came but it's still a small business in fact Ron himself\nWorks at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nBut doing that actually helps him to figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to me guide to the court I have a bad guy and I said sure and they say slice it I'd have them do both and they pull out of back from the local supermarket from a local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe\nShe's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow the real thing here\nIs that the ... is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston so you decided\nThat you were going to make this a new experience for new open pen experience where people could come and eat lunch and buy bread yeah we were going to\nGo from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right and almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened the Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd where are you serving their um we were serving sandwiches and soup soups made on our Britain costs on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on\nOn a real French back at it would be a roasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing\nAnd I don't think we have the language for back then but with the big recap I was was an altar of between [noise] down and dirty fast food yeah and find diet and for people who were working white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings\nThis was the first example of what we later came to cough vast casual this was an attempt to do something that was better but in a quick service mode [noise] so so once you surf stumbled on this idea of creating\nCafes and bakeries it was up to the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interest in that we became hot you know every major office building one of the French but cricket and we found we developed big competitors [noise] All right so something something happens\nIs along than acquires this a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy a dislike small chain and St Louis was it was the idea to to turn them into a ... you know I you know I talk\nTo everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis bring company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... ... homeless as much as we did with an old bone pet but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis brick company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November in Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nTo youth choir St Louis bread

we rename than concept [noise]\nAn air breath in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it their bread because as we went to new markets people often thought St Louis was more associated with hives Dale horses ah our than with breath right and so we wanted and then the vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight ... you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point we need you extend beyond those original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was
