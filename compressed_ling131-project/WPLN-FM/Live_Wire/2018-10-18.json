with Burbank hope you're having a good week we have an exceptional show in store for you\nKnow we've got gas like Jose Antonio Vargas who has a Pulitzer Prize also Courtney huh my sister who used to be the host of this actual radio show or she is back\nLet's comedy from Marcella are whale and music from planes on paper all of the folks on the show this week have faced their fears in one way or another and men announcer ... started things off by talking about some of the things that we are afraid of that we have a hard\nTime facing so let's pick things up on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon\n[noise]\nI have the personality type that when something is intimidating me when I'm afraid of dealing with something I just avoid it [laughter] when my wife and I got married she noticed that my policy for dealing with bills was waiting for the color of the ... to change\nNo no this like they'll mail you the first few bills will be in a white on top and then when they want to escalate things to tear to the unbelievable turned yellow my policy is if it's yellow let a mellow [noise]\nThey will\nEventually send you a red Angelo [laughter] which is like hours before the power goes out or something [laughter] and my wife was like looking at this stack of multicolored omelets going what\nIs this and that was like it's my system not facing my fears flake or were\nYou afraid of I just I I\nDon't know that it was going to be more money than I wanted to pay it just was I Would see the ... I Would think that doesn't seem pleasant to interact\nWith that reality right now [laughter]\nWhen I could go check Twitter ...\nLike I don't know a couple of months ago I intercepted a letter that was from the IRS address to me and my life\nAnd it said that ... I had from like two years ago all of this and claimed income on my income that I had not told the the IRS I get emotional even thinking about it [laughter] and\nI did not want to deal with it nor did I Know how to deal with it and it was a substantial amount of money and I just had this ... and I took it into my office and I put it under something [laughter] that was how I dealt with it and for like\nTwo or three days I was just walking around the house with this thing just crushing me with stress or my wife would go like you know I don't know if any of you do this but you'll have a really intense thought going on in your mind you're really worried and your partner will say what are you thinking about and for some reason you have nothing\nTo wait on the world on me but I'm like oh no food so finally I had to tell her about it 'cause I didn't know what else to do\nAnd she looked at it and she was like oh no we we claimed all that that's a clerical error and then she just opened a spreadsheet on her laptop\nThat had all of it and all of the documentation oh my God she called them and they were like yeah that's our bad\n[noise] and my plan like if I were not married to her I wouldn't be hosting the show right now I Would be in Canada [laughter] that was my plan [laughter] burned my fingertips off and start over [laughter]\nAccording to twenty lawyers it was a terrible idea [laughter] um but you know the license was expiring\nThe Portland driver in order to get a driver's license was valid that was one of the year one kind of legitimizing ... at a bar and the club and I freak the hell out because you know like how do you people forget like I'm undocumented\nGet I don't have the right document like how do you get around in America and post nine eleven America without any sort of ID it was really the only piece of ID I had thanks to Oregon and it was expiring on every third two thousand eleven which was precisely may thirtieth birthday\nAnd so it was like miss tell tale heart kind of clock beating inside of me going like okay what are we gonna do and at that point I was writing for the New Yorker I just finished my first documentary you know whatever I was living in your so the choices was I either self deport\nThanks to Mitt Romney for that phrase and actually my original plan was to leave because you know I haven't seen my mom since I was twelve um so I haven't you know she sent me here I haven't seen her well um she can't even coming a tourist visa because she doesn't own property she's not a college graduate that tells you a lot about class and race\nOr I I stay and again I'm totally fine if I had to like be a janitor or babysit your kids are more your lawn and\nServe you drink like you know what people expect us to do and find with doing that but\nI ended up being a writer and really the only reason I became a journalist was so I could write my way into the newspaper\nBecause it was my way of physically feeling like I was here so I think the whole time I was just carrying a lot of guilt about how can I be in the business of truth telling if I'm lying about Hawaiian were you were going to carrying guilt or were you carrying\nUm anxiety or both I think it was and the way to compartmentalize that is you just you know thankfully I don't know how that happened and I I could have gotten into drugs like I'm an alcoholic but instead I'm just like I'm just going to work work work work work and you know you know what people say that people like me should earn or citizenship\nYou mean people who are undocumented\nYeah like you know whenever they talk about immigration reform do like hey they should earn their citizenship so I actually convince myself but I have to do that which meant that I had to get this really you know good resume and then they realize like earning what have you done\nTo her citizenship [laughter] absolutely nothing\nLess just kind of turned the tables around like if we were actually you know apparently there's like a hundred and fifty thousand undocumented people in the state of Oregon if you were actually to compare what citizenship is I Would argue that undocumented people exhibit of greater amount of citizenship that you could possibly imagine [noise]\nYou know I don't want\nAround everybody and say like hey have you proving your worst what have you done I don't want to do that that's ruled totally rude [laughter] I don't want to do that and I just want us to be able to figure out how we can share this base together and like what it means that our lives you know work on a bill to each other\n\nWe're talking to Jose Antonio Vargas\nAn undocumented citizen I'm ... from the time when this was basically a secret that you were sort of keeping or at least not many people knew to end you publicly declared that you were undocumented\nUh how has your life changed our you less anxious now are you more anxious I mean certainly the current administration is probably not helping for you [laughter] but like what was it what's the difference in your life before and after you went public with this information\nOr the biggest thing is the moment I came out as an documented I knew that I was only one story one story right and because I'm I look like this people are going to project on to me this good immigrant model Maine or to stop doing that by the way it can we start projecting on Asian people just model minority thing what's your thought\nThat was going to happen so I started an organization called define American dot com please check it out and out and play Eighteen people which is amazing\nBut just to check just how crazy our immigration system is so I can employ people and provide good health benefits insurance that I Can't get myself [noise]\nKind of twisted is\nSo I started his organization and then after Trump got elected president I was living in downtown LA and the building manager texted me and said hey I was a um I don't know what we would do with ice showed up if we can protect it so when he said that it kind of crystallized for me\nWhat my own situation was that I Can't pretend that my life has been and always been in limbo so I packed everything up its own storage and I've been living I have another place sense it's actually wrote the book while I was in hotel rooms and are being bees and friends' houses because\nI just kind of had to face what it means to be in this kind of purgatory\nWhat is the future look like for you I mean uh uh do you think you'll be able to live out your days in America or do you think it's it's a sort of a likelihood that you'll end up getting deported at some point\nI don't know I really don't know but I have to be prepared for everything the book just came out I did the today show I've been just going through the browns and what's fascinating is so many of my colleagues in journalism the number one thing they asked me after they read the book is\nI just don't understand why you can't fix this thing but before we talk about any sort of policy of politics we get on the same page about what we're actually talking about right right\nAnd I don't you think that is in your that is for example if I just counted all the undocumented Asian undocumented blocking document that white people what do we want to do with them and the rule now is what do each community each county each state really wants to do with us so there's only twelve states that allow us to drive\nAnd I'm Sorry to say the Oregon is no longer wanted them right so\nI really don't know anymore what can happen in DC given how partisan and toxic it is what I Do know is every community has to decide who is welcome and how do they define American\nRight so our work is into that as a gay man I remember the time when Alan was on the cover of time when will and grace is number one talk show on television right before we actually passed same sex marriage as a law\nThe culture in which we talk about gay people had to change it is now thankfully culturally unacceptable to be anti gay in this country you say something at the immigrant not only is it acceptable you get elected to be president the United states\nWhat is that about right\nWhat's one thing that somebody is listening to this interview right now out wherever they are in America who might want to try to change the way that we talk about this and the way we think about what's one thing somebody can do\nHas to start or would you meaning how willing are you to be uncomfortable talking to your relatives about this are you going to call your coworker out who says something bad about illegals right lake\nAt defining American we strongly believe in the gift of uncomfortable conversations that's mostly what the show is a break [noise] but for me if you are not um\nNot doing it right drink so get comfortable with the discomfort of having real conversation at our Web\nBased is right\nAnd that's why I think this book is going to really help because it's a clear deliberate two hundred page play by play of what it actually means to be this kind of abstract term I think in in the minds of a lot of people that live in this country it's just kind of\nBlank place holder word like immigration reform or illegal but now here's a story with a beginning middle and I hope\nA the kind of and that we all want for you that I think can can make that change with a relative or a community or community member or a school if they could take a look at the book Oh thank you\nThat's the hope but you know look I Love this country if I did and I would have already left I Love all the teachers that ever welcoming here I Love I Love that I'm from Mountain View California I loved it you know this is a country that always tries to figure out how to better itself um and I think we have to remind people that\nIt is actually a choice for us to stay right we choose to stay the question is what is your choice what are you gonna do\nJose Antonio Vargas everyone\nIn the book you're American document [noise]\nHard Jose we we couldn't let you leave quite yet are we are talking this week on the show about fishing our fears\nAnd as you mentioned and as we were doing some research on you we learned that they fear that you have is going to therapy or you apparently told NPR that you've never been a therapy before because you've always been a little bit scared of it because you watch Frasier as a kid [laughter]\nAnd so we were hoping that we could sort of help tackle your fear of therapy and whatever residual Frasier related ... do you have by giving you a little quiz about those topics of the segment that we like to call let's get quiz at home\n\nYou know [noise]\n\nIt does get a work 'cause I uh we're gonna give you a quote and you have to tell us if it's advice from the fictional Dr Frasier Crane [laughter] or a real quote from an eminent therapist [laughter]\nOkay yeah sure [laughter] [noise]\nWell Courtney welcome back to live wire thank you where it all\nIt feel to be on that side of the hosting experience I eat how does it feel to be a guest on this show\nIt is completely bizarre it really but I have\nSay I watched people for nine years you know well for twelve years right sit over and the guest area of the audience and wonder what that experience must be like and it's been great\nI feel comfortable asking you this because uh you ... you write about it\nCan you take me back [laughter]\nThat fateful weekend uh-huh you are the host of this show yeah and I was scheduled to be a guest on this show yeah and you decided not today said [laughter]\n[laughter] right well and I didn't think it was done hosting the show I just knew that I was having a massive today panic attack and then I couldn't\nDo it and I mean I had I been hosting for nine years at that point and\nAnd I had never canceled a show um my wonderfully supportive brother\nI called him and he just kept saying you've got to cancel you have to cancel\nAnd I said oh there's all these people they're counting on me and and there's the whole staff and the audience and my brother is um he's a very straightforward person and he's a very kind person but at the time it was just he looked at me he had to look on his face\nThat said it is so adorable that you think you're that important\n[laughter] he just looked at me and you know when people when someone tips their head and looks at you and that's what he did he put it bluntly her heart\nBless your sweet little heart\nThe world is not going to stop turning Collier producer and what was the\nWhat was extraordinary about that moment as you well know was the you were going to be on the show the next day and the whole reason we were having you on was that you were this guy who was a podcast host and we thought you could fill in for me if I ever got sick and I\nThink that part of what happened when my brain going this is your chance this is your chance to get out of the situation\nI don't either [laughter] I again\nThe things I eighty four for a number of years I'd had panic attacks on stage and I had when I called my dread ball for every show and it was an untenable situation and I called Robin ... is our producer at\nThe time and I said yes amazing Robin and\nI called her with a problem in its allusion and I said I Can't hosted let's ask loop to do it but what I didn't know was that you weren't a massive bender that night\nThe morning of the show I was massively hung over\nOf those things from like a like an old like Bob Hope movie\nThe person wakes up and they see three of everything [noise] like\nOf those mornings and what I was looking at it was my cell\nPhone and there was a lot of missed calls from Portland\nYeah yeah you were Bob Hope drunk yeah um you know and I've I've been on book tour and I've been telling the story and what I always say to people was you hosted that night and I already written the whole script right like everything was done and you hosted that night and what I said to do when I say to people is\nSomething happened that was wonderful and horrible and that is that the show was great and it was fine and Luke was fantastic\nAnd so I realized that this thing that I had helped to make could totally survive without me and that's great news and it's terrible news you know it's the whole reason that I didn't really\nYou know so I always thought that the show is the thing that made me maybe the only thing that may be interesting right because they didn't have a great self image and then this other thing is when everyone thinks you're really lucky it takes you a really long time to realize how miserable you are\nI'm Talking to coordinate Hama stir writer extraordinary radio her\n[noise] you\nDescribe your personality is high and eroticism and blow in extra version which seems a like a bad fit for you or you know you've done stuff on stage you amazing singing voice you posted this show you're like how do you square those two parts of your personality\nUm it's very difficult I mean I I struggle with neurotic through them obviously but I also struggle with you know I started with a negative self image for a really long time and so when I realized with the audience were this thing that caused me so much anxiety but at the same time\nHearing their applause and their laughter was proof that I was an okay person you know and and I think that when I lost the hosting gig and I realized ... one of the things that I lost was just all of these people who\nMistakenly would sort of gives me credit for them having a great time for three hours on a Saturday Night you know and somehow it was like that means that I'm worthy of something and you cannot get your self worth\nFrom four hundred drunk people that the terrible idea\nI'm going to do my damn just to see if I could make that all\nRight\nSo you you you start writing this column and you started this really active process of of sort of taking on projects that were scary to you or pushed your comfort level or your boundaries 'em and you wrote about it and there's like adventures are kind of amazing when did you feel most out of your element in all these different things that you took on\nCuddling Pauli Amory drugs you name it I Would say\nI was most uncomfortable going to the professional Cutler my imagining that was by far the most difficult thing for me I can you explain the professional color I mean it's sort of right there in the title yes but for folks that are familiar with what what what is going to address\nTheir name is Samantha has and she has a business called cuddle up to me and you pay a dollar a minute to cuddle her um she had a business out of her house for a long time but she was so successful that she opened up a storefront here in Portland\nAnd she is fifty six different positions that you can choose from but she really sort of as an EMT path and kind of decide what you need\nAnd what it's like why was that one of the things that was really scary for you\nFor me I'm afraid to talk to strangers I don't like talking to strangers I never approach people in public um and so for me the idea of than cuddling with a stranger is far\nCombination was that I saw the the the ocean of snark that came at her when she got a lot of media attention and I thought that people said things like that pathetic and you know\nAre just terrible things about the people who needed her and the thing was I had been single the majority of my adult life and I really like a decade where\nPeople were touching me and people who get touched on a regular basis they don't understand what it feels like\nTo knock it touched and what it does to your self image you start to believe that you don't deserve to be touched or loved and that feeling is so vulnerable and and so what gave me trepidation about it when I related to the people who needed\nHer so there was so much bound up and going to see her and you know so many so much fear and she immediately put me as much as I could have been when\nMy entire body was a two by four you know like I Am so I turned into a maybe a piece of on cook spaghetti instead of you\nKnow yeah but we paddled for a while then she had me do these affirmation\nAnd which I hate affirmation I hate them so much but but the one thing she made me say you know I'm enough I'm amazing which I Know I Know it's ... and I was fine with it I was like this is fine I Am enough right now uh I haven't paid my taxes for twenty twelve but that's not a big deal\nOut of the job of being the host of the show is tax problem [laughter]\nWhen you're talking about that I was like a been there\nAnd you know and I'm amazing and I'm like amazing I did this number scared but then she got to I'm beautiful and I started crying and I realized oh that's the point of affirmation it's not necessarily point you to the things that you want to believe but point out that things that you know you don't believe about yourself because you can't say\nWe are to take a short break we're talking to ... her book is okay fine whatever the year I went from being afraid\nOf everything strongly being afraid of most things this is by by already ever be All right well [noise]\nYeah\n\n\n[noise] knees\n", "show_name": "Live Wire", "year": "2018", "city":
