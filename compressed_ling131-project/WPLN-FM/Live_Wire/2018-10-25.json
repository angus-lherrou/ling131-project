Burbank how's it going hope you're having a good week [noise] I Know I certainly have up for reasons that I Am about to explain from the stage of the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to take a listen to this [noise]\n\nIf I seem a little\nCalmer a little more at peace a little more centered than normal\nStanding up here it's not an accident people originally started meditating [noise] and it is changing my life technically I have\nOfficially started the meditation\n[noise] but I downloaded a meditation apt to my phone [noise]\nWhich as you know is the hardest part about meditating I Believe the Dalai Lama\nSaid that I'd like to tell you that\nThis is the first meditation apple pie of downloaded to my phone\nNot true [noise]\nHave a folder on my phone [noise] that is just basically like the enlightenment and graveyard\nIt is full of meditation apps and breathing apps and various things like that that I have downloaded and never even opened 'cause I like to hear about it\nOr I I read about it on slate and I'm like this is the one that is going to change my life and then I downloaded\nAnd then it doesn't really change my life even though I have been on this journey pretty much my entire life to try to find\nThe thing whatever it is it's going to actually make me feel some sense of inner peace and happiness like even when I was a kid when I was ten years old this was my little ritual I Would do my chores on a Saturday I'll\nGet my allowance which was two bucks\n[noise] I Would ride my bike to the Jack in the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents and I would get some fries with the rest of the money I'm side bar that was about Thirty years ago\nAnd three decades later he going price for a jumbo jak hovers around Ninety nine cent still [noise]\n\nWhich seems like a big red flag [noise]\n\n\nSo I gave my little food and I'd ride my bike home and I would sit on my bed which was all made in my little room that was all clean from doing my chores and I would get the food set up no take out the first French fry and I didn't catch up and that would bite into it and then the moment that I was biting into that French fry I Would feel a total sense of calm [noise]\n\nThat would last for upwards of Fifteen seconds [noise] 'cause then it was time to start thinking about the next thing whatever that was an even though\nIntellectually even then I understood that this idea of having to have everything perfect even though I knew that was not like the recipe for happiness I sort of have continued to live my life thinking that if I can just get everything perfect\nNews department strives to bring you meaningful stories and clear explanations and we need your support to stay on this path called today at six one five seven six zero twenty ten or give on line at W. peel lemon doubt or WGLA News I'm Alexis ... marching that's been put on\nBack ... radio from our Ira the Alberta rose theater this week\nFor a bank I'm your host we are here with George Saunders his latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln's son willy who passes away and he's in the bar do which is a sort of a limbo I guess of sorts\nAnd a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really have something\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I uh quoted from historical sources verbatim plagiarized in Memphis is that it was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had tightened up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feel like I'm just avoiding writing this is this is an elaborate we're doing a collage yeah yeah and then at one point they describe this party that the Lincoln's head and\nIt was kind of his party that sent the sun and to the death spiral 'cause it's a very loud party in the White House so um I was renting these bits and suddenly\nThis magical thing happened every writer craze which is it stopped being writing and it started being event\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it's kind of the realization that even that weird thing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax\nWas part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the the audience and then I thought oh this is really weird and actually it's if there's a great feeling like you're being a little naughty\nOr someone's gonna really hate to you know and and that's actually the feeling you want because if you can convert that person who says ... bunch this fake news you know or whatever is that\nIf you can blow away we're trying to create a safe space for these people sick I got\nA forty five minute timeout on those\nTerms if you can convert the skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time um did you find out stuff about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously no\nYeah I just fell in love with him I mean these are one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly he was incredibly attractive to women\nWomen all we know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system of kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating married not making your own happy so I thought that was kinda cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nYou know yeah I Know the [noise] I Know that sort of that is are you are a master of George Saunders but also you know the\nThing is I I I came to love about him and said here's a guy who's you know a\n... years of noise in the last four years of his life making incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday killing tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know and if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his ego\nAll in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I I mean Buddhism I ... in somebody who's a initially very large ego\nIn the in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and so to watch them at the end having realizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know\nWhat'd you say that stands in contrast to the current president\n[noise]\nWere you when you're going to work at ... under a softball question that's going to pop up well I actually [noise]\nI I Do want to talk a little bit about\nThat world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was it was published in the New Yorker\nAh when the presidential campaign was still in full swing and I still think it was probably for me maybe one of them are illuminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um did did that\nThen to make you less surprised then the rest of us when he actually won or were you a shock\nTo know I we weren't really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it's like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert helped music you know it's just [noise] but then\n[noise]\nBut when you got right down to it we we liked each other but we didn't persuade each other so I I've come to think that\nWhen you look at Lincoln you you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable of ambiguity more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration it seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fear from us and distrust and that's really weird is really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually a better adversary if you have to be one so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and a love uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this mess [noise]\n\nUh well now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking of George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in and literature when you were I think around thirty but before that you actually graduated from the Colorado School of mines and worked in oil exploration I did yeah guys [noise]\nWhen did you when it's mind ... Muslims oh they have got to get a bigger sign 'cause that is so confusing in the fact that the two schools are next to each other\nVery when when did you sort of realized that you\nAre not that you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a a job that you can make a living\nAnd I I kind of realize that the first week of classes because I I had been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and they had these two teachers new emblems who intervened and actually called the school and got me and so and I love them so much and I when I got there I realized that uh\nI had to not flunk out because of I flunked out of there I was going to go back to that starting line in Chicago in you know ... circle the bowl so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it that's how you get this is a real turning point you've got to stick it out so I did and then I went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and I'm actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing right I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in the ... river after some drinking and with and with no clothes just like you know that thing that'll sure are\nWeb streaming is made possible by states and harvest ... service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at ... dot com\nOr about three years ah gave up the job and came home and started writing\n[laughter] so so loud [noise] that is not where I expected that story to be going [noise] so this is what I tell my students you know the swimming pool the river and you'll know [laughter]\nWell yeah you you you teach\nYou teach a and the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I wanted to get your sort of take on on the state of things there are and one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving 'em to your students like more than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if we both stand up for and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming that talking cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there was a great line um I think Robert ... said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about the sonnet and he said\nYoung man don't worry work\nThat's where you can tell that story and then was a process expert pull me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't work worry\n[noise] I like it better that way you have and so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged\nAbout the you know next generation of writers I mean are they doing things just differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age\nYou you feel a little bit of that but what what the best thing about my job is every fall and we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is eternal it as an old person you you will get into that mode works if you're you know if your mind as a ... tends to tighten over time you know\nThere [noise]\nIs that a result of the monkey river that happened to\n[laughter] but when you but when you see these young people are like you know if I think if I ever find myself saying these kids today is just my mind being stupid you know so I Am so cheered by by senior been traveling around the country\nTo the generation the young generation now is unbelievably uh compared to what I was on obstructed and Loving Out I'm very hopeful about the future well I think they're in\nGood hands with George Saunders teaching them charge thank you so much [noise]\n'cause that's what my mom would do you watch the ball and when your age you like what [laughter]\nBut\nNow I'm older like we would go for mystery rides and you don't have a lot of money you y'all hop on the Chevy that blows purple smoke when the door for us won't work and you drive through at least with no headlights on in your mother says you're\nRight and you're like where are we and she's like\nWe're in a shopping center but you don't know where we are and now I like I appreciate and love that that's how you know that's what we had you know\nUm you you also have a you've written for television I Know that Europe have projects that are in development and you act as well ... or ... is there one of these things that you ... like you feel like you have a sort of special aptitude for are you a standup comic who actually are you an actor who got into stand up comedy\nI'm a human being whose so lost in this world I Will do anything for the appreciation of other people\n[noise] ... ultimately comes down to [noise] I Know\nEvery single day I'm like I just stopped doing stand up I I it's the most shallow for you know it's like a very sometimes is good and then like acting as something that's fun but I don't really think I'm that good honestly I don't think anyone is that good I think ten percent of people will act or good everyone else who can everyone can do that [noise]\nThat's just the fact that Daniel Day Lewis and then there's like All right everybody else you know what I mean [noise] I mean let's be honest I'm so acting as whatever um I really enjoy writing but it's a lot of work you know one really wants to work that hard ultimately if I could do anything I Would open\nUp a little general store and like I have a bell on the door and I'd serve coffee in the morning and I did pick up my kids from school and then like make dinner and they go back to the store and then you know you know when you get your you know that's an achievable dream\nAnd no it's not I've been trying to buy those one place in my neighborhood and the guys like I Want seven hundred grand I'm like what are you on your mind to seven hundred grand so you actually walk into the store like can I buy the store from you well first I met his wife and I realize they weren't doing so well you know what I mean\nShe was loose lips about it you shouldn't have been and then I got the husband [noise] I got him on the phone\nWrote a proposal that he's like why don't you come and have a meeting with me comes in he tells me they're skimming off the top they're not even important talks so I Can't get a I went for a small business loan I Can't get a small business loan when he's telling me they're making two hundred and twenty grand a year but your report and forties and that's not helping me wait so like they're located at two to\n[laughter]\nBut guess what everyone's cheating in lying and stealing that's you know what I mean it's like what are we\nNot these fine public radio and its allies have you sent the text messaging the last two weeks\nThen you probably lied because of the easiest way to live now you can't be there I guess you can't you're a liar [noise]\nWhat do you have to tell people to their face you didn't live as much now I\nTo be with a kid but I'll say something like I'm making gym\nJust 'cause it sounds more fun [laughter] I'm like oh let's have an interesting life Jay I'm making a big spread [noise]\nRJ Larson a along with getting real one of the things that we
