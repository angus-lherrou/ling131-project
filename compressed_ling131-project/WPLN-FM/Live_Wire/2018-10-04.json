plus we have music from Portland zone Lenore and coming up we're talking about ... on the show this weekend and as it happened\nI needed to get off to a fresh start with our actual announcer ... for reasons that will become clear right now let's pick things up on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland\n\nI Need a fresh start with you because you've been doing this show for a maybe a half a year or so now you you were a guest on the show previously was yes and I got an email this week from our executive producer that I explained that I had been mispronouncing your name\nEvery single show that we've done over the course of the last six months my actual\nName is Mitch for men's\n[laughter] I don't know how so many of those letters are silent I Swear to God it's pronounced Mitch foreman yeah what would I Elena pastoral All right what am I doing wrong\nI I didn't make this comment I didn't like call live wire HR and file are up for ... claim or anything but I think many Laura heard\nMe saying my own name or in the announcement thing and I said my name is Elaine a pass or a low\nBut Elaine a passing a lane I mean\nI I was born in the south so does it matter what your name is that they're going to southern ... so I grew up my name was ... when I was growing up so there's there's no wrong way really\nI mean I Would take I Would take a leaner any day\nBut if I'm if I'm being official is\nIn the past but I only get like the full hearty like when my mom was mad at me [noise] pass the law is in a real name either it's like a myth somebody mispronounced at Ellis Island there at the Italian version a is either\nPass the rally or its past ... real low like with the one of the vowels has changed so you know\nWhatever but I mean whether or not pass rather it was a real name it is the most perfect name for you because you're a professor at Oregon State university and as our house band in particular Jonathan love to remind you what are we call you professor a lower\n... is a highway that was that was meant to be discovered and speaking\nOf fresh starts when I moved to Georgia from South Carolina after the last big hurricane I had this fresh start with this new person I was in third grade and the teacher in the first day called me ... and I didn't correct her for like six weeks [laughter] so I'm used to\nBut I mean you just go on even longer than that yeah yeah yeah you apparently have even less forceful now in adulthood that you were as a small child mind to school in South Carolina\nAnd just like my hero Barry Cohen I get off I got up in Shreveport and bought a New Testament coloring book\nHere like a kid backpacking through Europe Canadian flag on their back to where I always carry a New Testament when you're in Louisiana and the dog\n[noise]\nThis seems like a perfect place to take a short break the Gary stand guard\nHis new book is a lake success this is live wire radio from P. R. I. we'll be back in just a moment\nSees\n\nWelcome back to live wire frumpy are at the boroughs theater in Portland, Oregon this week with Burbank here with an ounce ... and Gary ... his new book is lake success you may know him from his many other amazing works including super sad true love story and little failure\nUm New York magazine did an interview with you about some things that it's like eight things I Can't live without it I ... for whatever reason I haven't read many of the classics but I cannot pick up a magazine fast enough if it has the mundane things at a famous person likes\nYou know I'm pretty erudite that way and I read years with great interest and what I noticed was that most of the things that you listed nothing other live without it was a shirt you like it was a watch you like to believe some sunglasses temper solves they were all things that were given to you for doing a reading somewhere\nOr you in this literary game just to get free stuff\n[laughter] you nailed it male there\nAnd there is a country that exist just to give away stuff to two people to writers and other people it's called Italy [noise]\nI don't know how it survives but the moment I learned there they give me stuff [laughter] socks are full of gas but I got him in Italy for doing a reading [noise] you\nGet off the plane and they come up to you and they're like here are some soccer\nIn God but these talks are Dr Easter I Can't really do that right now\nTalk about bro finance culture for a minute what's worse bro finance culturally sort of hedge fund folks that are making ludicrous amounts of money or losing money yeah and still somehow getting paid on that or are the kind of literary cognition antique cars\nGroup or the other who would you choose I think I Would choose literally calling us in the uh because we all go to the same cafe in New York cafe so Barsky it's post analytic appointments and we have our\nDownstairs from like ... therapy [laughter]\nFor our ... pretty much log that we do that at six than we have are crying our but that last night [noise]\n\nThe ... bros I hung out with especially in twenty Seventeen were all the funds began to take we drank so much every man and it was men or what would a drink is owned bottle of ... thirty year old\nA and one night at five AM I got home and I sat on the corner I couldn't ... way oh sure I couldn't figure out how to use my fingers so my wife has to do it for me and I'm Russian I can drink you know and and you were hanging out with these it's finance folks because you are researching the book basically a three to four years of of suffering yeah\nHow do you find\nThem to talk to you or were you just passing them on the street and asking if you could go drink with them and uh because there's nobody else in Manhattan anyway exactly yeah every time I saw that it was like hey buddy [laughter]\nLet's get busted and and\nI'll stop soda\nYou probably have in your brain that you did there might be sort of a jaundiced eye when you're going to paint it grab people how do you make that attractive enough to the people so that they'll fire and you can't be like I Want to land\nRight so I was looking at I met a lot of dissatisfied hedge fund guys or many of them had intellectual pretensions\nMy heard the smallest ripple of sympathy\nFor that was just like major sarcasm just undulated through the crowd here at the Albert or is there [laughter]\nAnd everything they said was hilarious everything members of their family said was always hilarious like I met one hedge fund white and she said I was asking I have a little kid and I said where should we send them to school and she said oh\nEthical culture for sure I said why that and she said because it's so diverse I was like really and she said yes some of these kids their dads aren't even hedge fund managers there just doctors or lawyers\nIs banned them in the book I Know\nTo hang out with you again I Know I Would have been out of close to your show I'm more of an error [laughter]\nI'm guard everybody the new book is lake success [noise]\n\nAll right Gary I feel like we have been getting to know you move in a in a real and personal way here on the show so far but we want to try to take it a level deeper or ... we we\nEndeavor to do here on live wire and so uh what what I have here in front of me as an actual physical jar in it we have enough by the central questions of our time\nYou're a man of letters you've been honored with various awards for your writing your best sellers you know a singer to about a thing or two and so well we'd like you to do is dry question out of here or late ... will read the question that we want you to answer it honestly we call this exercise the jar of troops\n[noise]\nOh boy [laughter] alright falling a question out now if you can hand that to Atlanta\nA land will read it and then we will get an answer to wanted to find a central questions of our time\nIf you bring a bottle of wine to a potluck okay nobody opened that can you then ethically take it\nI I [laughter]\nOh my God this question as my whole life basically\n\nI wouldn't leave my bottled but took a better one\nThe living room and having a long time [laughter]\nTo not your first\nRodeo I my first rodeo stolen bottles of parties now [noise] now did you know you were picking up a more expensive bottle as you as you left or or is it one of those things where you just grab the wrong one but you weren't going to take it back I just bring up three dollar bottle of Georgia wind always so it'd be better [laughter]\nI was at one of the tech broke parties where you could get I got about ... I've been I've been I've been\n... or something I was bought a two hundred dollar bottle of whiskey to hedge one party and the guy says I Love your poverty\nThere is a lot about expensive alcohol in the book lake success as well as a way of the characters establishing where they are in the pecking order and uh and the protagonist had gets like a thirty thousand dollar bottle of whiskey that are real thing is it's a thirty three thousand dollar bottle of ...\nThat I drank quite a bit of a drink a Hyundai Sonata it's worth of\n[laughter] ... not everyone\nWere the potluck like it [laughter]\nDo you check roads have potluck oh no\nDo you have you had\nThis thirty three thousand dollar whiskey yeah how does it take its course [laughter] it's really good I Would encourage everyone to try one will Gary thank you so much on the show a great job on the book lakes excess baggage dine got everybody\n\nLive wire is Roger you buy Alaska Airlines as an airline that doesn't just lie lumberjacks into ... which well monitored daily flights in over one hundred Fifteen destination the U.S Canada Mexico and Costa Rica ... Alaska Airlines lives all kinds of ... all kinds of places\nAnd if you're a lumberjack who needs to get to a glacier\nThey probably got you covered there to find out where else they fly at Alaska air Don ...\nOf course we hear a live wire we we bring folks in from all over the country to be on the show but as it happens Portland is also full of interesting people and we like to meet one of them each week as well we call it our new fascinating friend let's meet one right now please welcome Maxine McCormick to live wire\n[noise]\n\nOr it may or you know doing comedy that in a town of three months previous and they wanted to go over their jokes and\nAnd that's the one great thing about stand up is that anyone can do stand up you know it's not like other art forms of other things where you need money to get started right you just show up you go to a microphone you talked into it it's like so straightforward and I love the fact that it's it's equal opportunity in that regard so\nYou know why not why why shouldn't they be able to to learn the art form and and they were funny like they were legit funny\nLike what was your approach ... have you taught stand up before do you have kind of a curriculum that you do\nKnow I don't know what I'm Talking about\nLike what do you say day one in the minimum security prison on like here's how to do stand up I mean\nTo some degree you know I tell people that it's important to listen to stand up and not just watch it if you want to be a stand up because when you listen to stand up and the comic is making you laugh it's incredible because there's they're not even in front of you with the words are so well written so well placed\nThat you're forced to ... that means that if you're on stage and you're already funny without seeing you like when you're actually\nThere and you're seeing the comedy you're in a laugh even more so I think that's that's one thing\nI'm the facts are no rules you can do whatever you want with comedy don't be restricted by what other people tell you I mean for the most part I just wanted them to ask me questions I wanted to go over there there are jokes because they'd all written a ton of jokes and they you know\nI wanted to help them with their sets the talent shows where we went over jokes and some of the jokes were like amazing and some of the jokes\nWell okay how do you tell\nHow do you tell someone and granted this wasn't Rikers Island right how do you tell somebody who's currently incarcerated that their jokes really not working\n[noise] the cool thing about jokes is that the silence tells them huh [noise] so I mean it gets me off the hook [laughter]\nHave a feeling a lot when someone's telling me a joke or if I'm going to stand up comedy club I feel because I think of my own insecurities and whatever\nI feel very uh like embarrassed for a person\nIf they tell a joke and it doesn't get a laugh so I Will personally try to laugh I I was in labor that Robert De Niro in Cape Fear in the back of a menacing at some point but it's like I just like I I don't want them to feel bad right were you able to ... stifle that in the professional advancement of these people learning what was it wasn't a good joke\nSometimes and sometimes I'm like this guy really needs to be the laugh right now I'm going to live right now I mean there are a good job this one guy a guy that was funny he he he was talking about the matrix and he was saying how knew how to pick between the two pills yeah the red telling the blue pill right\nAnd he said if I if it was me I wouldn't I wouldn't have picked I would've taken both pills because I'd like pills [laughter]\nGood show [noise]\nI did\nNot see that coming either yeah\nI was like he had another one too he was like a a parent's apparently a Coca Cola used to have cocaine in it and what I what I realized recently is that you could still put cocaine in it\n[laughter] [laughter] that's\nA really good is if somebody incarcerate Steven Wright [laughter]\nI was just so and like they all have these great stories and you know and they were saying like when you're in prison for such a long time in the weather is a couple of years some folks have been there like decades like you have a lot of time to think and you also have a lot of trauma that you're trying to find a way to work through and\nComedy and being like like comedies natural defense mechanism that's how we've survived there is no other evolutionary advantage to laughing right right it doesn't you know it doesn't get food and doesn't get it it it's it's it's it's something way that we can survive hard times and so\nThey all have great stories and I love the fact that in a comedy club they get judged based on whether they're funny or not nothing else and I think that's important wow\nI'm your new Netflix Peshawar neurologist it's got some real hot chicks on on Indians and Indian Americans and their love of mangoes yeah what gives\nA ... and he was up mangoes [noise]\nThat's the especially the joke [noise]\nHow did you get a Netflix special out of that\nMan they must have confusing it with somebody else I'm you know it's funny I wanted to get more personal on this special 'cause I feel like a lot of ... so like socio political and and I talked about things that I've been very passionate about but I don't really share anything about me so people kind of\nThink they know me through my ideas and I'm like why not just tell people who I Am and uh you know the mango thing is just about like the history of mangoes and bought with a big cultural thing for South Asians and I wanted to dig a little deeper in and let people know who I was because it's just a weird thing to go up there in rent\nYou know what I mean like I think that like based on my style which is kind of aggressive and the fact that I went after\nThe Simpsons like I just looked like a kill joy no one's allowed to have fun unless I tell you out\nI can also see how this involved for you because you you know your community organizer in Seattle yeah I have a background in economics I mean you I I Know the social justice is a really important issue to you and you also we're doing standup yeah so it seems only natural that when you get a microphone and people listening these two parts of your life are going to kind of blend together yeah\nBut the thing is that when you're a comic I think the the thing that people love is that they connect to you and they feel like they know you write and the thing is off stage I'm much more agreeable than I Am on stage and I mean I think that's true they are able fellow I'm like I'm I'm very charming and then get carried away\nBut on stage I feel like I you know I saw myself as this person that has this tunnel vision and I'm ... I'm good at writing jokes that are critical of things but I'm like I Want to have fun hey man I Love mangoes like like and and I like talking about I mean I talked about colonialism in the bed but still\n[laughter]\nDomingo doesn't fall that far from [noise]\nUh we had to take a quick break we have already gone to buy low here you can see him on Netflix currently with Warren your relatives or you can also hear his podcast the ... brothers pod cast check it out I tunes wherever you get your podcasts this is a live wire will be back in just a moment\n\n\nMe\n\n\nWell come back to the live wire from P. R. I. where at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon we have already ... here on the New York times wrote a piece\nA little while ago about a Kamau bell show a totally biased which you are a staffer on into the gist of the of the article was a totally biased with Kamau bell had\nLike every promising comedian working on it performing on it and then it it was cancelled and they've all gone off into the world and done these amazing things what was your what was the feeling reading that a couple of years after the show have been canceled\nI mean we could use this five years ago\nThis or that but it's probably would have helped I mean it was one of those things when we were doing it I'm like\nI think this is a little ahead of its time some already imagining it having a Ben Stiller show status or day in a car bishop kind of thing just as we were talking about whether is transgender rights or we were talking about police brutality and\nYou know come out it is so aggressive you know with the stand up he goes after big issues and it's not to be snarky it's with passion it's with a clear point of view and it's with that passion and clear point of view that one in four I mean after the show ended\nIn ... he just won an Emmy recently had a baby I had a big patch on the baby that said families belong together\nI on the red carpet sometimes not soft peddling it no and I'm happy for him but I'm\nSick of seeing pictures of him and his Emmy and I'm sick of him taxing it to me and we're good friends but like how many more of these pictures can I take [noise] yeah but I mean like I think that the\nShow was an incredible show and I I Wish we were around longer and I thought maybe you know we were headed by the time I didn't know we were like two or three years ahead of time like we probably should have stayed on a couple of years longer to everyone else caught up but\nYou know it was a it was a really smart show and and I are the guy brand name was on an apartment on chair was on it\nAllows us getting her rights recording was on a Janine burrito Dwayne Kennedy like a bunch of people and a bunch of older writers who are on mystery science theater and on Conan and all these different shows or what an incredible space to be and and\nYou know come out with such a powerful voice so\nThere's been an argument going around lately or maybe a conversation about what is and isn't stand up comedy\nAnd then I think it was coming on on Gianni who said that's the most boring conversation to have like if you like it watch it if you don't like it don't watch it right and I think some of this a boost sort of revolving around", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Live Wire", "city": "Nashville", "day": "04"}
