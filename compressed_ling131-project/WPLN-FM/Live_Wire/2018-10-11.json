[noise]\nHey everybody welcome to live wire my name is Liz Burbank I'm your host\nHope you're having a great week\nDoing whatever you're doing we have a great show in store for you are theme this hour is\nOn the contrary and we've got a bunch of gases who are doing things contrary to what the sort of perceived wisdom is but here's the thing it's\nTotally working for the ... or not those kinds of people who are just contrary ... for the sake of being a contrarian because as you know\nThose kind of people are super annoying [noise]\nAnd also it turns out\nI'm One of those kinds of people at least when it comes to my marriage let's pick things up on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland\n\nI'm the kind of person who when my wife does something or says something that isn't what I Would do or say I cannot stifle the urge to contradict her and when you were married to someone there are just so many of those opportunities\n[noise] that just arise what makes us even\nShe is not like on the Internet late at night telling me that Trump might actually have a point about Obama's birth certificate like she's not saying things that are like a objectively crazy where the disagreements or about things like\nHow bright should the lights be in the room when you're watching TV at night\nThis is a long running skirmish in my marriage\nI vote for a little bit them if it's night time it's kind of makes it feel like a movie theater it's kinda fun my wife says full brightness she thinks it is depressing\nWhen the lights are low last night we were settling in for a romantic evening about to watch them dateline NBC\n[noise]\nAnd I go over and I am the lights and she gets up and walked right over and turns them back to full blast and I said why did you do that and this was her answer verbatim she said because we're not donors\n[noise]\nI've been thinking about that comment for twenty four hours straight and I still don't really understand it [noise] I don't even feel like those are related concepts [noise] but like it's not a big\nDeal the light in the room I should just let it go it doesn't matter but instead what I Do is every time I get up to go get something and I come back in the room\nI just subtly damage by point zero zero zero five percent [noise] casually as I'm coming in the room\nAnd over the course of like ten trips I've brought it down to the level I Want it to be at and she hasn't even noticed it is like some kind of reversed gas lighting and it's [noise]\nPretty immature we disagree about when food should be thrown out my theory is you can scrape mold off of most things and if that doesn't work you just toast the living ... out of\nIt and that [noise] masks\nA lot of issues she is strongly of the opinion\nThey feel like they have to have some perfectly Instagram of oatmeal uh which really isn't the case\nThat's write the book is branches how we've got a brand and Francis numerical galley on out here the authors of that book this is live wire radio from PR I were to take a short break and then come back and then talk about the the opposite state of affairs the dinner party stay with us this is live wire\nFees on on the phone from New Orleans\n\nWelcome back to live wire frumpy are Iraqi Alberta rose theater in Portland this week our team is on the contrary and we are talking to sprint and France's ... Enrico galley on oh you mean other from the dinner party download radio show in pod cast as well as her new book brunch is how\nI'm this book is sort of a a criticism of brunch but really it's a celebration of dinner parties thank you um what are the what are the are the keys to throwing a good dinner party you whether you want it to or not you've kind of become the national expert on this topic because of your radio show in ...\nWell we wrote the book on it now literally wrote the book on it but I mean the first real dinner parties is right there on the titles to have dinner and the party yeah that's it\nNow that seems deceptively simple the point is there should be no agenda at a dinner party you can have a boss at a dinner party it can be setting up people at a dinner party a holiday party isn't a dinner party because there's an agenda there a dinner party is really we considered recess for adults this is a place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with a lot of that\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we save suggest more than that my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen of our of our friends right cliff we save save that for the ... for Thanksgiving and I got a separate thing\nUm and so that's the rule number one is that how people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control where soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go so those are the like the\nThe basic sweating out what elevated dinner party from just meeting the minimum definition of a dinner party to being actually a good dinner party\nWell I mean a lot of things come conversation would be a great thing to have\nWhat you're trying to do is get stories out of the people and we it's fascinating we actually have a quote from Alan Alda about people who actually wrote a book about sort of the way people share information and industry when people tell stories their minds literally sync up like their their brains to light up\nIn certain ways so that it's almost like her mind melding with people so if you can get people to tell interesting stories you're actually\nWavelength so why do you think that the dinner party has declined in in in maybe not popularity in people's minds but certainly in frequencies yeah I think the rise of\nJudaism is maybe more interested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes or we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made at home you need over half of us fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing they were meant to I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York in LA or ... or apartments are small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that a present things id and I think that people have been lulled into this false sense of security that brunch and restaurants are really going to bring them full joy\nI got a couple of quick questions here um music at a dinner party or I Am one of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like Christian do with the scissors sisters cover of comfortably numb right as everyone's getting a little buzz yeah and then someone else wants to plug in their iPod\nAnd because they have jock jams on there or something is are you a bad host if you kind of rule your stereo within with an iron fist at your own dinner party absolutely\nNot only that it's a musical dictatorship I absolutely for either urine controller you have any control over to one other person otherwise it's an absolute free for all you know one moment you're listening to fly in the family stone another moment you're listening to ... which could be fun for the after party but not for the meal itself\nSo you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it\nWhat about children at a dinner party yours or your friends wanting to bring them\nThere was an actual grown of\nJust [noise] you know those are and how dare they [noise] uh we\nWe ... we have said ... as we said before dinner parties or recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we have kids and it is important too to an in coal train them to the pleasures of the form of the dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though on on one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid\nAt like dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck in prayer meetings but what you're a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get it was kind of get out what that was like everything to me\nAbsolutely but but and so the the catches here that they should be old enough that they can take care of themselves so that they can observe from afar the adults can have a hard time and the kids can have said the kids need to be just old enough that they can entertain themselves without setting themselves on fire or ... and like going to the bathroom and they have to be able to hold their liquor\n[laughter] at if you're already is probably\nObviously the book is brunch is how renting Francis NewME Enrico galley auto everybody [noise]\n[laughter]\nRight Rico and Brandon your new book branches hell points out or what you guys see as the sort of drawbacks of the brunch vacation of our culture on but what you don't really get into very much or the caloric repercussions of branching it on the rag [laughter]\nHere's what we have done we have done some research on popular restaurant brunch is and how many calories those breakfast and brunch is contained we're going to give you a caloric number because you're the brunch expert traitors you have to guess\nIf that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfast ... calling it caloric over under a thug\nHow we view of the day you get the mound gay mom [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's like schoolhouse rock but the schoolhouse became gentrified and turned into a restaurant\n[laughter] [laughter] okay so this is a\nPretty simple game I'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you've got to come to a consensus on this um that as the as the the authors of brunch as hell if you think it's over or under the Guinea's grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under that it's more for I have\nNo idea calories ... like I don't really think about ...\nI'm Sorry I forgot I like to know about them [laughter] I did I went back to write [noise]\nI'll say is it sounds higher than\nThan a grand slam no I'm saying it's way too over graduate so Rico your opinion is a grand slam as more than a thousand calories ran in your opinion is that it has less than a thousand calories sure okay I Will say that Rico is a hundred\nPercent right and Brenda there were a hundred percent Ron yeah it is one thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point\nFive grams of fat\nHow about the jumbo Rudy Judy freshman pretty firm I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nDirty it sounds healthy yes it does have sausage bacon and hang out of compost and pancakes so the compost the vegetable yeah ... yeah that sounds housing and protein I'm going to say it's under\nUnder Thirteen hundred calories that is Brent inferences ... official answer Rico going on out of the ingredients you just had real\nHas come out and they meet him pose no no no it's a fruit component\nBut with bacon and and then you'll definitely get some breakfast meats in there that anger making their sausage there's also ham I still [laughter] then I say that is again too low it's got to be more more calories than that and once again I'm going to say\nBranch Ron ... yeah it has more than Thirteen hundred calories it is over it has fourteen hundred calorie and my God if you are looking for the diet choice the regular Rudy duty comes in at ... eight hundred and forty calories\n[laughter] how about the garbage plate\nA regional delicacy in Rochester New York one of the many places you can buy their new wrenches hell yeah here's what's in the garbage plate home fries baked beans French fries macaroni salad sounds healthy malice mustard onion and hot sauce last wow two slices\nIt took you ten years more before you actually followed up when these people who are more or less begging you to to be able to represent you or to get some pages from you what happened in those ten years\nWell and the opportunities came to me I was in my twenties like twenty five and one this big writing prize and I got to go to New York and meet all these amazing agents and editors and so it was kind of being offered to me on a beautiful plate\nBut where I was in my life was in a place for all I felt was a sad\nQuiet stone my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me it took ten to Twenty years for me to stand up inside the thing that was being handed me the front of me and to say you know I might I might be able to stand up inside this too\nAnd so I'm kinda here to remind any of the rest of you that uh we all deserve a place at the table\nAnd it doesn't matter what shape it takes and we're not all going to look like celebrity culture and that's a its own kind of beauty the weird kind of bend did stars still shining the sky so I'm here for you [noise]\n\nIf you start or religion I Am signing on [laughter] I Want to be the first adherence to the church of Lydia ... thank you so much for
