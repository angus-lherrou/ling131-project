father became its last and ill timed an awkward performance\nSmall John's hair was must and he was sticky the baby was cross pulling at her pink bonded and her dainty lace edged dress whining\nThe

though he had taken some pains to secure a meeting at last painless\nAnd had in fact stood just so waving court Julie from the steps of the train for perhaps as long as half an hour\nEnsuring that he should not be caught half ready his hand not lifted so far as to over emphasize the extent of his delight in seeing them again\nHis wife had an odd sense of last time\nStanding now on the platform with the baby in her arms and small John beside her she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home or whether they were standing here to say goodbye to him\nThey had been correlating when he left and she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget that in his presidents she had been frightened\nAnd hurt this will be a good time to get things straight\nShe had been telling herself while John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again\nSymbols like she'd like\nTo look at him his hair she thought was a little darker than John's and his hands were stronger this man would build whatever he decided he wanted built\nWe need things together things we like both of us small delicate pretty things um I agree\nWith John ... she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea of but with a stranger [noise] she said we'd have to look for them\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said like a little tiny man only colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\n[noise] much later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was radiant she had no conscience\nSki went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smiled that seemed to mock the president the subsidy for doing the things that John always did\nAnd she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this will surely not going to be permanent she could not indoor having him go on for so long every day\nAlthough she had felt a little about parting from John moreover if he kept doing John's things he might grow imperceptibly more\nLike John we will simply have to go away she thought\nShe was pleased seeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right old that had been John's so long as he stayed her stranger\nShe laughed while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in unpacking his suitcase which he had abandoned and forgot and then uh\nTake it up and leave again if she had not been as he thought her had not wanted him to stay she put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute of the closet\nWould there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John's things\nThen she told herself no not so long as he had been with John's wife\nAnd she left again the baby was cross all day but when small John came home from nursery school his first question was looking up eagerly where is daddy daddy has gone to the office\nAnd again she left at the moments quick sly picture of the insult to John\nHalf a dozen times during the day she went upstairs to look at his suitcase and touched the leather softly she glanced constantly as she\nPassed through the dining room into the corner with a small shelves would be some day and told her stuff that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion\n[noise] when the

was mistaken it would be on a true bleed cruel for John to come home tonight\n[noise] then she heard the car stop and when she opened the door and looked up she thought no\nIt is not my husband with the return of blackness she was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts and yet he was so clearly a stranger that seeing him she had no need of speaking\nShe asked him instead almost meaningless questions during that evening and his answers were important only because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was a way\nShe asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college and who was that girl he likes so before he met Margaret\nWhen he smiled and said that he had no idea that he would not recognize the name if she told him she was in delight she had not bother to master all of the past that and he had learned enough and the names of the children the location of\nThe house how she liked her ... tales to get to her and after that it was not important because either she would want him to stay or she would calling upon John send him away again\nWhat is your favorite food she asked him argue Fonda fishing did you ever had a dog someone told me today he said once\nThat he had heard that I was back from Boston and I distinctly thought he said that he heard that I was dead in Boston\n...\nWas lonely too she thought was sadness and this is why he came bringing a destiny with him now I Will see him ...\nThis is not my husband and wait for him remembering that I Am waiting for a stranger at any rate she said you are not dead in Boston and nothing else matters\nShe saw him leave in the morning with a warm pride and she did her housework and dressed the baby when small John came home from nursery school he did not ask ... looked with quick searching eyes and inside\nWhile the children were taking their naps she thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon\nAnd then the thought of another such afternoon another long afternoon with no one but the children another afternoon of window hood was more than she could submit to\nI have done this too much she thought I must have seen some thing today beyond the faces of my children no one should be so much alone moving quickly she dressed and set the house to rights\nShe called the high school girl and asked if she would take the children to the park without guilt she neglected the thousands small orders regarding the proper jacket for the baby whether small John might have popcorn you when to bring them home\nShe fled thinking I must be with people\nShe took a taxi into town because it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do with seek out a gift for him or her first gift for him and she thought she would find him perhaps a little creature all blue and purple and gold\nShe wandered through the strange shops in the town choosing small lovely things to stand on the news shelves looking long and critically at ... at\nSmall statues at brightly colored demeaning less expensive toys suitable for giving\nTo a stranger it was almost dark when she started home carrying her packages she looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets\nAnd thought with pleasure that the stranger would be home before her and look from the window to see her hurrying to him he would think this\nIs a stranger I Am waiting for a stranger as he saw her coming here she said tapping on the glass right here driver she got out of the taxi and pay the driver\nAnd smiled as he drove away I must look well she thought the drivers smiled back at me\nShe turned and started for the house and then hesitated surely she had come too far this is not possible she fought this cannot be surely our house was wiped\n\nThe evening was very dark\nAnd she could see only the house is going in rows with more rose beyond them and more rose beyond that and somewhere a house which was for years with the beautiful stranger inside\nThe next morning she handed the new flies to the doctor as if she'd done them herself he seemed to really embarrassed he'd made such a fuss and he asked her out to lunch to apologize I was not invited [noise]\nI never said a word of what happened not to any one I was willing to be colorblind if it would keep her perfect\n[noise] I told you she got pregnant just when he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets thought of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of the evils scheme\nShe's looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor when\nI asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses [laughter] they're worried about the boy getting into the right to elementary school his wife could go into premature labor she's got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow a lot of crap\nShe stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes a down in the register I think\nThe

another I say she should know\nHe finally showed up past ten last night dog tired from being stuck on the train for five hours he said but I was the one who was tired tired of waiting all that time of

you know what he told me\nHe said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible forest was holding him back that it wasn't the right time\nAnd that was why it had snowed he said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer and then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left\nI imagine her naked the doctors fingers running over her skin her hair the wet places I picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue envelope who wouldn't want her\nGastrointestinal med too long up demolish the one short neurology one long pediatrics for short I pick up the pace trying to distract her but she's not paying attention anymore depends still on the\nDesk how could he be so cruel how could you tell me to wait no I couldn't wait any longer not one more day not one more second\nI take the register and begin checking the coats myself trying to be as needed she is that's why I killed him she says her voice is low and cold\nI feel a scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back and instead\nI calmly imagine the scene the knife and her pretty hand the blades slicing into him again and again skin ripping blood spurting\nBut she's I pick up the next coat respiratory medicine one long it\nSays I shake it at out falls a tongue it's still soft maybe even warm\n[noise]\nMore in Ireland performed you'll go
