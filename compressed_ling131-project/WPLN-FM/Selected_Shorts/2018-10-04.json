stood up opened her arms have you know\nAmerican butter\nNo one spoke Saba kept quiet for of course she had eaten American butter but what good would it do to mention that now besides few had the courage to challenge strong will Lula even with the truth no one has ever\nAmerican better so that in that settles that mood took out another country's loaves of bread and a bag of roasted grains I

didn't have the heart not to correct her and she didn't know which would have helped her bring this to the right resolution so she just made a vague gesture and let them finish\nHe is not a bad man

when ... visited after lunch time\nOnly to find a full meal waiting for her\nWhen several refused ... insisted that the dishes were very clean and the food fresh\nThat wasn't as bad though is sitting down to eat just a little and passing on the salad the water\nThe cheese the fruit eating only the lentils and bread accepting some coffee but not even the milk\nYou've all been so kind to me said bowing respectfully pronouncing all her syllables perfectly precisely as quickly as she could I\nHave not Mr Thing but it's late and it's true the traffic is bad ... she has learned the the Opie and way good girl too polite to say you need anything here ... replied putting an arm on south by shoulder\nCountry continued okay don't tell us that's okay but if you visit again to stay a while and if\nFind do you are homesick for something you grew accustomed to their in America\n[noise] he is a good son I Am asking you to take two loaves of\nBread okay forget about the third I don't want to

grandchildren so they know I Am thinking about\nThem that I have not forgotten them ... could see that ... to ... to say\nWhat she really meant she didn't want her grandchildren to forget about her\nA fear she must bear living so far away for so many years with only limited lines of connection\n... argument hung in the air\nUntil the crews stood hesitantly and walked over to the suitcase finding his bag of spices on the floor beside it he reached into the suitcase and took out three American English dictionaries and toss him onto the coffee table\nAnd shouted out why fick root what'd you do that she ran over and picked up the books and through them back in the country took them out for that crushed her bread\nCrew who kept opening his mouth to speak but found himself overpowered by the more forceful voices seized his opportunity like a fourth chair or Castro musician stealing a flourish\nAt the end of a number [noise]\nHe stood next to an overwhelming Saba and said everyone here has a relative in Seattle yes\nThen why is it that only my son is going to pick up from the airport [noise]\nHe turned to the others you talk about what so and so needs or hadn't done\nBut my son without asking for anything has volunteered to get her\nHe will be carrying these heavy suitcases too he's caught then he will take her to her dorm and bring these heavy suitcases up the stairs if they're stairs or down the hall should there be a hall what kind of hurt to bring a few items for him\nThe crews showed side by his item just a few bag of spices Karimov grain of paradise better Barry please side law a humble parcel for my humble sun\n... turn to uncle fossil and discreetly pointed to her watch OK\nOkay\nYou all have something to say ... offered cutting off the remaining gas to gather round the suitcase eager to make their appeals but the traffic yeah traffic sent the crew the traffic around ... set in unison and moving nodded fuss they'll turn to solve a\nShe asked him what do you want to do what do you want to do\nFor the last her though each person at room had his or her body turn to the suitcase all eyes were on ... who was trying to figure\nOut how to navigate this scene\nThey looked her over and imagine she looked so what\nDifferent just apart\nWith our woven bag which intermittently glowed with the light from or iPhone or beeped and paying them vibrate it from the sound of or other badger tree for American genes tucked into tall leather boots or white button down shirt and gold earrings while they wore a modest clothes and hand me downs some of what she had brought\nHerself she had been in the country\nOne whole month and had tried they must know to learn the culture to re acquaint herself with their first home and fit in\nThe second time they wore the same house but they didn't have a camera they just stood there not smiling not holding hands not even speaking at least not that he could hear all the way up the hill [noise]\nMinutes past that way before the couple began on talking and an fattening their shirts and then stepping out of their sandals and an buckling their belts and their pants and taking off those things as well as the things underneath\nAnd pushing the clothes all into a pile that the man picked up and dropped over the rail they threw their hats too and then they just stood there again only now they were both naked and she ... it looked like they were both bald\nHe blinked several times and then held his eyes closed and and when he opened his eyes the couple was still they're still naked\nGlanced at the bedroom door which was closed he could hear his mother whistling water splashing in the kitchen [noise]\nWhen he turned back to the window he pressed his nose to the screen and he watched the old couple take a step closer and hold their faces together in a way that may have meant kissing\nAnd then he watched as they turned in the grip the rail and it used to themselves over\nOne leg at a time and even as they felt they never made it sound\n\nIt he had to remind himself that whole year had passed between these sightings because in his mind they blurred together and ...\nWhat happened to the camera that they had balanced on the rail was it still there could be his now\nBut then he would remember that there was no camera not the second time the second time it was just the man and the woman and then they were gone over the railing down without a sound his father told them it was impossible\nJust not possible that had happened that way\nHis father said that there must have been found if not\nVoices in at least of impact humans being as heavy as they are and he wanted to believe his father because he knew that what his father said was true\nBut at the same time you also knew that he himself has said was true because he had seen it and standing there in the living room after supper as his mother fold towels\nAnd his father ... to the newspaper she struggled to see how everything could be\nTrue all at once when his mother finally spoke she agreed with his father\nShe agreed that it was not possible for her son to have seen what he had seen her reason being that for him to have seen what he ... he would've had to been standing and staring out the window not studying that morning notes [noise]\nAs he knew he should've been sitting at his desk which was a good wooden desk made by hand by his father and facing the wall way on the other side of the room and so he agreed with his mother she said he hadn't seen anything at all you must have imagined it\nOr maybe it was loose in Asia and an illusion such as people experienced in the desert though he'd not been in a desert he'd been in his room but maybe he needed to drink more water he said in his mother agreed she said more water certainly couldn't hurt\nBut what he is seen on the bridge had not been an illusion he knew that and back in his room she tried to see the whole thing again it was nighttime no house was quiet he\nGot out of his bed and he crawled underneath under his bed he could pretend that he was in a cave or that he was a turtle and the bed was his shell and he found it easier to think this way it's just easier to concentrate [noise] now when he closed his eyes she could see it\nThe bridge the couples standing there and their hats staring holding hands than not holding hands than an dressing now naked over the rail and down and then nothing\nNot nothing he thought\nHe couldn't be nothing she kept stinking and thinking until finally he thought birds\nThe old couple or rather they had become birds\nHe closed his eyes and she saw it all again the couple the un dressing everything as before but this time before they hit the ground their bodies shrink and their arms turned flat and wide slapping and he saw it again and again each time a little clearer\nTheir mouths became beeps they sprouted feathers\nTheir eyes turned shiny and small and black and their toes curled and sharp and like ... they looked like hawks and they dipped their talents down in the water\nBut there weren't any\nCouple flew on they circled back under the bridge up into the woods where they were mice and worms and rabbits because to a bird these things would taste good and actually he himself had eaten a rabbit before do she hadn't realized it at the time she didn't know\nThat what she had to eat and was a rabbit until afterward when his father told him he had been happy about that but then his father told them that rabbits are meant for eating and his mother had agreed\nWhen you thought about it and he decided he wasn't upset anymore you felt bad\nBecause he had known that rabbits and so it was a sizable mouse but she decided that his father was right the rabbit was just doing its job which was to feed their family and then he felt fine he did mostly\n\nBut now under his bed thinking about the old couple and the bridge and about flying in birds he did not feel fine\nHe couldn't help wondering now what is the rabbit hadn't really been a rabbit and\n[noise]\nAnd other former all from la [noise] Joan\nAllen performed branch by Daniel J O'Malley\nIn our final story\nTed Chang's the
