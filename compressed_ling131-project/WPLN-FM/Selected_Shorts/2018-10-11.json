whispered reassurances\nA dog that's\nOld bones is spoke fathers trusted friend the bread men explain he's in his last days now for gotcha are his favorite treat\nI turned to the old man hoping for some kind of clarification surely he wasn't going along\nWith this nonsense but he\nWas still examining the happens to the insides of is I Would send could not be reached [noise]\n\nYou have a system

realize now that I should have thrown the pie or at least done the thinking that led to the throwing of the pie several weeks earlier than I did but it's very hard to throw a pie as someone when you're pregnant because you feel so vulnerable\nAlso let's face it I wasn't ready to throw the pie I should add that the pie was hardly the first thing that I thought about throwing up mark but every other time I wanted to throw something Adam I couldn't bring myself to do it\nOnce for example right after I found out about him and Selma I'd been seized by a violent impulse but the only thing I could see to throw at the time was assigned ... chair and\nI Am far to boost walk to thrill assigned to haunted anything at any one [noise]\nSometime later especially while I was in the hospital I gave considerable thought to smashing Marquette in with a very good frying pan\nThat I had bought at the bridge kitchenware company but I always knew that I Would never do anything and the storage and in any case smashing your husband's head in with the frying pan seems slightly to fraud with feminist content if you know what I mean [noise]\nWell even now I Wonder if I Would have thrown the pie if we'd been eating and Betty's dining room probably not on the floor and Betty's dining room is a beautiful oriental rug and I would have been far too concerned about standing it\nFortunately though we were eating in the kitchen and the kitchen has a linoleum floor that is how bourgeois I Am\nAt the split second I picked up the pie to throw it at mark at the split second I was about to do the Braves is all the at the most derivative thing that I've ever done in my life I thought to myself thank God the floors linoleum and can be wiped up [noise]\nUh on Saturday afternoon\nA walk to buy the pie ingredients I took Sam with me we had a long talk about how this Daniel would be coming home from the hospital on Monday and how much Sam was going to love him and how he was going to feed him some delicious spiders\nAnd we bought food names it was a beautiful day so we decided to walk down to the toy store\nOn M. street and on the way we passed the jewelry store where mark had bought me the diamond ring and I remember that I hadn't taken it in yet to have it fixed it was in a little ... in my purse\nI could see Leo Rothman the owner sitting on a stool behind\nThe counter Leo [noise] the deer white haired man who had marched with the Abraham Lincoln brigade in the thirties and been thrown out of the Labor Department in the forties was now a millionaire jeweler who bust only white people through his electronically operated door\nShe buys me in and gave me a big kid when mark was courting main um when he was pursuing main\nWith flowers in balloons and Jules Leo was the man that mark bought the jewels from and as a result Leo failed owned those proprietary about our marriage she and outfitted the courtship the wedding the birth of the first child the first child silver spoon and\nShe didn't seem to mind that except for the diamond ring none of marks purchases had amounted to more than a few hundred dollars [noise] I totally feel about the robbery and he said it would just take a minute to reset the stone salmon I waited while he got\nOut his instruments and went to work we were making conversation chit chat nothing much um she said did I Know the diamond in the ring was a perfect stone I said march told me that\nShe said it wasn't the kind of diamond I'd ever have trouble selling if I ever wanted to see a told mark that he would be glad to buy it back for what mark had paid for it I said I was glad to hear that he asked me how I liked the necklace\n[noise]\nThe necklace I said\nUh Leo looked up and the loop dropped from his eye I must be thinking of another customer he said no no no you're not I said I knew mark had bought me some thing while I was in the hospital\nSo he had bought her a necklace for her birthday I was lying\nIn the hospital with a nose and he had bought her\nA necklace that rascal\nI said oh I shouldn't have said anything real sad oh I'm Glad you did I said now\nI Know what to be prepared for there is nothing worse than opening a box with a necklace in it when you're\n[laughter] I kept talking I couldn't stop once I said I was in the mood for an eye out and mark kept dropping hints about what he got me for my birthday and finally I said I don't care what it is as long as it's not a suitcase\nWas my face red [laughter] Leo was focused on the ring again I board him so thoroughly he barely rented a response he finished resetting the stone and handed the ring back to me\nIt was such a beautiful rang\nCaught the afternoon sun and made a rainbow on the wall of the store\nI waved to ring this way and that moving the rainbow while she giggled and left\nAnd tried to catch it in his hands\nHow much I said oh no charge Leo said you know how much for the ring\nI said how much would you give me for the ring\nLeo looked at me or you don't really want to sell it he said oh no I really want to sell it [noise] I said do you really want to buy it of course he said oh I Love the ring\nLeo but it really just doesn't go with my life it would never have been stolen in the first place\nIf I hadn't been born this way and if you got a ring you were on the what's the point of having it it's sort of like having a mink coat [noise] if I had a mean coach I Would have to take care of every time I'm In new\nYork and the next thing you know we'd be even broker than we are now mark is so romantic he probably spent every penny of his savings on the necklace\n[noise] Leo nodded for the down payment you said for the down payment I said it's a beautiful necklace said Leo now have a beautiful necklace I won't be able to wear on the subway either I said\nHow much for the ring Fifteen thousand Leo said Fifteen thousand I said that's what mark paid for it they all said my heart's started ... pounds I realized that I had just been given the means\nTo walk out of my marriage\nFifteen thousand it is I said to Leo ten years had passed the cost of walking out of a marriage had gone up\nI went home with Laos checks and made the pie I was in a trance well I don't know perhaps it wasn't a trance but it was as close to it transcends all ever get I was\nSpeechless I said nothing nothing at all for several hours [noise] at age I'm Mark and I took the pie ... it was just us um me mark Betty and Dimitri who bet he lives with [noise]\nWhen we got to Betty's mark and Dimitri went into the kitchen to boil the lobsters and Betty and I sat in the living room while that he talked about the dance that she in Selma and I were apparently\nGiving apparently we were giving it at the sole grave club apparently the crap man had already been booked apparently all that was lacking\nWas my guess list film and Betty had already drawn upstairs and apparently the Kissinger is we're on film is lift\nJustice I predicted I sat\nAnd listens and drank an entire bottle of white wine as bad he went on and on and\nBy the time I talked to her I just chip said we ate the mobsters I don't remember the conversation [noise]\nUm I Do remember realizing that no one seems to be noticing that I hadn't said anything the entire evening and that no one seemed\nTo mind I must try this again I thought I must try again someday to sit still and not say a word maybe when I'm dead [noise]\nAfter the lobsters I took the key line pie out of the freezer and put the whipped cream on it and sat it in front of\nMe I was going to give it five minutes to thaw slightly see recipe [noise] and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Selected Shorts", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
