Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] we're going to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's a good thing where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly aching and the press how many people do is be killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right Jason Harris sand in both John or animals become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody's track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrazil first study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nThink ... and three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years or so paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with ah the Florida demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSo to tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and it's we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you\nVery foreign percent six kind of person he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty stuff still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise] you know I mean they're all written in this ah\nDeployment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife at apartment to fight it off every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed\nShould we have on this table the investigation of the deaths [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople too\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off Ben Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults Carter right then if I'm having\nTo get into scripture brown somebody\nUs in the region where every side closer than some of them and then you know here in Florida\nAnd then we're going to let the club that nobody really wants to be\nCrazy with his family family is more than just\nRight\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the moms they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or a no no just wanted to address the nose in Missouri and has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but figure this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find a way\nIt was a personal gathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger stage a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a\nLike a like somebody\nThat I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house but she says his age comes around you know I'm just\n[noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christmas\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken now the guy\nKnow [noise]\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nFrom earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we started to stay over the house and\nWe see each other bad on the couch you know the mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over in first of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other more resources vice over his shoulder thoughts like therapy for I\nThink he's let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me to believe or add ... to ... minutes when\nCrystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars\nLike about twelve people have\nAt last either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass so\nWe usually the video that we can\nMy house probably over like right now and then the police caught attained behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we called execution a vegetable garden has to the guardian was here and vegetables\nAnd all that\nWell I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here it's all you can smell was ...\nAnd so now like when you play any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association what's going on ... that smell like it just you get those flat ... and you have time to finish brings you right back here mhm\nYep [noise]\nIn the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nSince I started ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nThen you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best a lot of what about falling to me a couple of women handed me the phone\nMy focus on what life is going to do it\n[noise] and and it's probably about\nThese eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nWith us for I Know [noise]\nYeah I mean we we haven't been eye on a law\nIt was also the graphite we've brought a once a week\nAnd I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember at the end I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nYeah my son's greatest about Fifteen minutes off guard at every time I visit home I have\nTo go there all the time of course\nYeah yeah no floors how could you not to\nI Know like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah and it's crazy because like if a with a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm\nAnd his credit you can go by there like a certain time every\nDay and it's this little white man we share\nLike that on like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day my dad would be I don't know if you're in the Democratic way out like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy that always did not know\nHe took his chair on the whole\nSo that you're to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you write to me to reveal who was some other Sandra Bland who I met she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nIn his around this time that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers the movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C.\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a nice day and a look at the razor thin life or death moment between ... and it got\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhance the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about slow not W.

progressive dot com\nThe guy was a buddy camp fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto its back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand painted\nYou're going to be heading down or you're going to get it again\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she became central four cups and then\nThere may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nOfficer oh say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to try your best shot and I think I hear you want to die I Want to you on a guy you can buy\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nAnd there have been a fan of our talents or do you want to\nBe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the un huh\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and\nThe guy leans in the current judge that when I'm In there and how you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\n\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nUnlike us through the neighborhood if you want to miss it on the front step waves ... what are you doing man dared doesn't stupid set up a bit you don't have close came to be in that ... wouldn't be back

Am\nReally on which the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing you mentioned is dead or Jupiter belongs his organization called her which decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition of police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being some being law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles\nBasically saying that being the top is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was his experience than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan ...

I'm Robert Krulwich this\nAnd raise mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe\nYeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah the feeling we had a but then you realize hope it's a funny difficult thing because well we'll let Matt guilty and been Montgomery reporters taken from here\nWe are here to see the Tasha Clemens ... mother Rodney Mitchell okay\nSo the touches the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met ... other mothers who've lost their children are that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because band was going to hand a ton of documents over to the Taj a on her son Romney's case shouldn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview with Natasha but when we got to her door [noise]\n\nShe just started shopping [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nAnd\nAnd I just had no idea\n\nBut then she had this trend that tape recorder off oh what was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up so meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip would um share of the police chief is that\nThe only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong it acted in accordance with the law\nAnd it just so happened that forty five minutes before that and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually\nEven left for like an hour eventually came\nBack kind of just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\nMuch of the ... long dreads he's got a big smile mix smile write whites smiling and then we shut down in her kitchen table um okay so ah\nIf you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened it's June eleven two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college you know driving a car and that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five W T amounts of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] they're\nGonna start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay good good where are we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again in the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than Dumbo John Ritter and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for an itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hits the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nDo something that's more complete let's do something that's on precedent\nWeb streaming has made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trusts estates and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com think in the entire\nState of Florida I think three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work county police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive\nSaying that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink men put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for the show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me sit six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county ... boy and beach uh all\nThe way through the alphabet has any basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nAnd the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could get that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect wizard chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and\nUm [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from our website radio lab that Oregon highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study\nAbout a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence of the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they\nGives a weapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for their same demographics and as we said they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but to me further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very\nFar ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were and why we want to start this nasty nasty things I've still just moved by the single cases in individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nI mean they're all written in this uh\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police big Fowler approached department to fifty five and confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife at a party to fight it off every one of these every report this at least one human life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed\nShould we have on this table the the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nOr two [noise]\nSo what do we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant folders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right Senate if I'm having\nTo get into ... brown\nLike something that I've been in you know here in Florida\nFind them in the lives that nobody really wants to be a part\nCraziness family more than just\nSo after the event ended at the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom bailed out in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or no no just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this as big as this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find a way because it personal gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point I was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just really I go to our house she says his age comes around you know I'm just\n[noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christmas [noise]\n\nMid sized one story house in Thailand and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken now the guy\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nSome earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses we sleep in each other bad on the couch you know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can literally I think he does he liked to have lunch with every day I mean I don't know if you if it's a Democrat in way out I go on for about five and all of that is a little white guy that's all we see now do\nYou think he's ... I Can't hold\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago\nAnd it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can even be feel with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the\nInternet or understand that a few of these women started called themselves the mothers movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun man with a knife and a look at the razor thin life or death moment we ended up getting it\nSo stay with us\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about slow at W.

get it again\nAnd the cop who's got his gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then she became central four cups and then\nThere may not a it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you're\nLucky you didn't just shot I wanted to come to your best to get shot on the if you want to die I Want to see that you want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nAnd there have been a fan of our talents or do you want to\nShow me to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for\nWhat it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that when I'm In the end you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause there are guys partner who is holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nA lot easier to see somebody is nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight go through the neighborhood that I mentioned on the

chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I
