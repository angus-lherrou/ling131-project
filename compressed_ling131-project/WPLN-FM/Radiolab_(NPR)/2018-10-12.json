what happens Fifteen Years after the classic play adults house when ... returns tickets at Nashville rap dot org\n... he's in trouble for out of the ones that are saying these kind of makes it and were they threatening yeah some\nOf the day where you know we can get in there that guy with the French Quarter during the wintertime comes in ... my ...\nNewspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nTo seek you gave them my safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother good are they doing your your sweat you look at\nOkay Washington\nA lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that the what is your mom say she said please don't do that it's ... it might be you know try to get to you things like that you know I'm ... like that yeah that was it like that yeah\n\nMm So and\nMy us all and and\nYou know oh you\nAre doing\nMe\nA huge change\nMe on\nRadiolab will continue in a moment and I have\nOne phone started crawling hey this is Gregory Warner than folks to read trucks radiolab supported in part by\nThe after the strong foundation of the public understanding of science and technology is the modern world for information about flooded WWW Sloan got or radio lab is produced by WNYC\nI and our thanks to trade from dot org theory on transportation in radio story got me thinking about some of these stories of fact [laughter] and now\nThis is just me no Columbus ohio radiolab is supported by constant contact offering hundreds of customize will email template designed to help small businesses established daily email contact with their customers are more constant contact dot com T I\nJust jumped ... calling from Seattle, Washington to let you know the radio lab is supported by progressive insurance committed to providing sufficient tools to naval customers ... and the auto insurance learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that progressive makes [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] uh [noise] uh [noise]\nDamn ... this is radio lab today [noise] five experiments and translation let's from number three very cold it shows a broader ... discovered the shooter was truck now you're try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producer and we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mentioned\nOath because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedian\nComedian yeah [noise]\nThing is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject I don't really seem to examine these expressions and all the more interesting\n'cause he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGot next favorite curling or some I really like just went to is about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality and\nCarlin was wonderful about things like that was about\nBoth she called and we have no more people in this country no morals people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these senior citizen\nAnd he was the reason we use the offense\nAnd I've just been through my father in law died like four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he died and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that it it like goals are reactions\nTo it that actually have like a kind of a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has this whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... directs language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue metal fatigue for some of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausting [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you bland it out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nAwesome when I saw people living\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street she told me that usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so I uh [noise]\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me it feels like\nAgonized here the ... and it's time to ...\nWhich he says when she put the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk when he\nCame alive [laughter] I thought it was amazing like I didn't know that this many people around the street at the same time as they have now they're um [noise] they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really stopped last chance if everything was your thoughts nice soft wrong she says that can move [noise]\nThere is walking and I can see their life living and I can see them their gate but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see ... or whether they're wearing a shirt or insurance or\nAddress has a just like see their shadows and every now and and I see the light counted on them really yeah [noise]\nI imagine some like underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah yeah like lady yeah\nYeah like that [laughter]\n\nIn that friendly is what it is\nNew York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking stash they make their way along in the sunshine\n\n[laughter]\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting while using the brain port and you can check that out by going to radio abducted work\nNo no no I'm not\nI'm I'm I'm\n\n\nI'm On my\n\n\nList is framed Gilmore calling from Reno nevada\nRadiolab is supported by target presenting future at heart a new podcast that explores the work

from Boston radiolab is supported by progressive insurance committed to providing efficient tools to enable customers to find a home and auto insurance learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progress that\n[noise]\nAh ...\nI'm\nA [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n... um ride I Robert Krulwich has radiolab and today experiments and translation oh\n\nGod\n\n\n\nThat's number five how does it make the right to do without a ride Brazil to meet the right to motivate the rule I better his daughter was about to be fair to me I don't know you try\nYou guys mind if in that remain a few minutes we're going on an army fishing expedition [laughter] sure sure it's the here's here's the here's our quandary Carl okay so what's your situation we're doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with\nTo talk about our name all thing we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nHis I got a little insistence I say just in a because you were like our night we got to learn it yes I said that are and I like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's what I said yeah well as often\nHappens you or me down ... and it was like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son's getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team work for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins ... ... ... and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when your bar and you get half your DNA from your mom half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that\nStuff all the stuff stuffed ... comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated like out of this for simple base has become the amino acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us how do you make the transition ... people were thinking of\nThis as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code problem\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nADC ACC teaching a piece of good\nAnd then out comes the protein like what\nWhat simple code could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out two sides\nI think that ourselves read our genes three basis at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA CD J. D. C. A. A. C. A. G. A. T.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not parents because if you have sets of three or rather than to game I figured well that gives mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins\nNow this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
