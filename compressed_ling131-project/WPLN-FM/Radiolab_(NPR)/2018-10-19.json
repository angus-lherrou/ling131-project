documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started\nIt all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to\nSwitch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees one on one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to\nThousands seismic changes this leak and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path nice face dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their screen flag to to Facebook and on Lake\nMeaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like her reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone\nHad reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something\nWould have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\n[laughter] rise up sites for the rights that replicating\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirror those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a face of breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for it and how long the unfolding of women threatened feeding their child right down in

work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that but yeah the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks\nOf of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving

back\nWith our story about Facebook and free speech and we just want to remind you guys are are those viewers tuning in a episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you you you don't want to hear this kind of thing because these are kids in the room might want to sit it out you know get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty ...\nHey Rhonda ... but sorry my aunt had to make it up thank you\nYou cut you off so abruptly Carla Monday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the

runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are his face is Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nSays CBS Feehery a studio on the other side of the country the next five million I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news right now\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage\nChilling new images just released the Boston bombing\nI remember seeing the photo published on line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise] sort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together and sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the rooms says no\nThe other people are saying Mrs newsworthy\nEssentially there's photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receives push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions\nThere is either or their mistakes were improvement\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like ... ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWords start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were actually told make the exception\n\nCare what the reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher were but they don't see maybe they have but to me the news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah ...\nAnd this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or\nYeah it is it now a news organization friends' parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact did even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting more important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slice of her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a

not want to be named\nI'd rather live that's totally fine you know I just go I ... I got here\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct for about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be damned uh at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor traffic has\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... Johnny\nCash I'd just like just a case or if I go every day I was just elected official alleged\nWhich fight five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThis is like ... or it's too I ... I actually heard a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHas exploded into you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages injure our cherry like\nThirteen year old girl having sex with an eight year old boy and it's just a lot of like\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely and if I'm actually a good\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were very specific like I said I couldn't watch it was why a lot of cases ... wife I left us it was like okay so what I like ... like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have to I I chose to real [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's a classic case yesterday\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more of this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorists propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they yeah they ah through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on\nAnd that surrounding hate speech oh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke\nTo me is

of months back I think it's working we sent our parents interns\nCarter Hodge life easier to this cramped narrow little comedy club\nAnd we sent\nThem there to check on someone else who found a fault

know like we have all the buffalo wild wings surrounded you know things like that eventually took to spit on stage even wrote some some\nUm mine died and my dad\nMy dad [laughter]\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a martial law drawn to Facebook but a ... instead of seeing her normal loose feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt says you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity group\nAnd so we've removed that post and so I'm like what can I possibly opposed it I really I I thought it was like a glitch but\nThen she quit to continue and their highlighted was the violating post it was a photo of her what what is the picture can you describe it the phone\nWith me is what can only be described as the cherub cute little

you know because I had I had a it's funny you know trust me it whatever so um I posted again\nImmediately after like yeah and it got removed again and this time there were consequences I got banned for three days after that then after several other bay on shoot forward this was months later a friend of hers had posted an article in underneath that in the comments section there were guys posting just really nasty stuff so\nI commented underneath those comments men are Scott ... which was very quickly removed\nWhen how how long did you get banned for this time thirty days wow\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook\nBut if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently but it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule but\nWhen we come back those rules they get toppled so\nThis is Danny from Denver, Colorado radiolab

you're just tuning in a episode desk contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with the kids in the room might wanna sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna let Rhonda Marilyn but sorry my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nCarlos Monday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston Marathon\nYou asked or does it does begin to settle\nPeople are spring into action or just one man in a cowboy hat\nSees a spectator who who's been injured picks him up throws them in a wheelchair\nAnd as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud ah there's a photographer there any snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photos show is that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nSimilar CBS feeding your studio on the other side of the country the next five knee I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees\nWere clustering around several deaths staring at the computer screens watching the news right now and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of uh watching some of the coverage chilling new images just released the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly glowing\nVoters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to do with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however ... says\nNo the other people are saying this as newsworthy\nEssentially just photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the receipts push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making them\n... there is either or their mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy how how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest\nOf the stuff van other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but\nBefore they can pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher were but they don't think maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now and news organizations strength parents\nThere let me let me get an I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nSenators this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside what\n... what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... you know give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man with his face covered grabs her head\nRight in front of the camera and this video starts being spread", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "19"}
