responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing but you wouldn't talk to this point\nThat this story that I'm interested in really get started\nIt's known as the buried bodies\nSo fascinating about this case this law professor lethal urban again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani Frank H army\nI'm Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New

this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the little guy and\nThat's partly why he became an attorney\nWhen you're fighting a cage for

forty five and a or just had the feeling the sky is dangers a love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank are members he represented him at first on two pretty small things while I'm On\nA schoolteacher head of the shelves due to this trial he was sued the school\nAnd I talk to them a little bit and then head on all of them were actually I wrote about that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police so eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door took of\nDriving the lady friends car to try to lose the tails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis measure as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah Tom ... father says it's on a road that goes to the miners are what is their to their minds [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very likely that day the share this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly speech there were no leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they could've came around here\nSo right up there so here we are in our Sunday suits there we go trudging choose for is looking for the case\n[noise]\nSpent hours looking [noise]\nUm [noise]\nWe found this was her phone while you see the airship after\nThey find this air shaft which it was just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there and so\nThey couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak a boost shoe and blue sneaker\n[noise] and and a leg\nAnd I said to myself this the bitch does it end he yells back up to Belgium get me out of the year ... back up that\n\nBell gee found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there without the founder so what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers tried\nAbout the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that has yet that can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up but even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there is no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers\n... that's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you have yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for their clients\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent of him or also citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder ... here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of ... just tell\nTell of course yes when I knew Mr hawk from

I was a good lawyer who\nCipher through art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been sitting in on these\nClasses and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to it they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... or\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me\nBut eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up\nDid want to go on the record okay All right yeah\nSo I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing washing camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a little ... schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't\nThink it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and up when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and that is why did they taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling\nWith the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that um\nI Will to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I get it and it's still a struggle to this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you're going to share I don't know when you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past few months later I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University really\nToo difficult for us and Danny what's your boyfriend had that just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just before and\nSo to live and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future I had a true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nIt's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know would want to ... for you to protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\nI'm going to get just a

man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly\nWhich they did he got the other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen or killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take

the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the ... people died\nHe went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue skiing because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing Dembosky with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in a chat\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol and melon asking ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David frame and he took the boy back to the campsite and he

towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and nuts began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies and state police standing by our there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with

it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that it's so fascinating about this case this was a law professor release alarm and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money frankly age aren't many\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago

the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up the back door\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose ... to ...\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis measure as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town to provide their of Mariah\nFather says it's on a road that goes to the mine is or what is your to the mountains it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just a very icy that day this hair is used to be an roadway [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hill is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nI'm very skeletal walking right in the same area that are many and this is the only way they could've came in here so right up there so\nHere we are in our son do shoots redoing trudging choose for is looking for [noise]\n\nBut you know the worst look [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nWe found\nHer phone while\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the ... the my coffee carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down there and so\nThey couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left\nAs Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe some blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg\nAnd I said to myself this some of which does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your backup venture\n\nLead algae found the other body at least your house body she was in a cemetery workout headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just care we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the\nCurrent rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be good that is yeah it can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up even if they have hired detectives and he is a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if\nPeople are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for their client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of tell just tell\nTell of course yes and I knew Mr hawk from going to see his du da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from church and\nOne is to be a man of the food bank received the burns of the family and your do you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more

I'm I'm Rhonda I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they've found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give them a moon you're going to take it a little\nWell that's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Andrew McCabe investigator from the state police the duct tape and the district attorney armies office and when they met Armenian bell gee search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause their parents there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nBelgian our money did was write\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so admire Atticus Finch and the difference between\nAtticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job a ... I was a good lawyer\n... art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if people say\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been in sitting in on these\nClasses and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal\nThis is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be ...\n\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record\nBut we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah\nSo I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and energy found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with all about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal thought never mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um did did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes in only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse\nAnd then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie a lawyer\nMy husband and causing more months of horror and [laughter] and that's why did they taught law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered any one a lot of professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I get it and it's still a struggle to discuss it because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you're going to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree passed you much lay uh we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us\nAnd [noise] and Danny what's your boyfriend had best jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and so to live and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\n\nIt's so horrible you know to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you really lose you used harder you know I wouldn't want to use that for you to protecting the person that killed her no justification couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\nUm I'm gonna get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay\n\n\nOkay can you hear the echoes of dogs don't amount and things tend to travel up the up the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's some deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell whereas stripping everything up here is frozen solid so sure what that is [noise]", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
