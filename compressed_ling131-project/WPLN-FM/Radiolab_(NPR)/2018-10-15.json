Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Ninety nine but we actually got interested in him a thinks our producer Lynn levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little about the kind of sat right in the middle of the page like a long\nStint sausage beautiful office now three syllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that are still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card written by this guy ...\nOf queen and he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she'd gotten sick the flu or something in this poll was supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick\nDemos hell so to speak to young lady affect young lady mommy none of us who doesn't look blowing through new ... piece of ... ... ... to ... ... to\n... to ... to ... to ... ... ... ... to ... I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you're always really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast what about Twenty years publishers for [noise]\nIt becomes very popular and the publisher decides to have a translate into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge ... what I meant was to say well here's the thing he says he got this problem\nMommy none of done little bones\nAnd if you just focus on the words that basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like prison ... piece of I cling on to ... to open your doors get out into the world ... owns ... get out of bed\nEat some jam Murphy too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped ... or ... units are like get better here's your good health\nInsurance to dwell on the bone in young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted and us and and this is key for doubt it also ... form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little stuff that shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line mommy and young is identical\nTo the last line I mean you just sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems leave him alone to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per lawyer didn't ya ya or us three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long so all of those\nThings added up to a set of constraint so you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this pump along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines at the bottom for example vast sea onto the tub boost you sort of like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can instead of squirming in your own set of slurping slop in that are burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bet\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ...\nMy sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside\n... for my sake buttered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner arise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear\nSo clear laws now Douglas clean all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became bread though the bread and butter\nButter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on oh her just\nSome people like just stick their fingers in jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it Doug sent the palm to one of the guys at translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft they'll regain health dress and fully off with ... Clement who calls from very different in tone and really quite marvelous you\nGot the pale face in there you go to Jan Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but Doug says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number so that's just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole road at three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the palm out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard ... who's colleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day\nEven got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the group that was all burnt themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French bread you know running around from town to town saying hey\nI got a bone anybody want either related and if I Am a person of Benjamin this began a been she myself\nIn that they ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump\nGo ahead and read out of the best one now this is dumb down right right no that's not the best one it is that one at ... K okay this\nIs also went to his but like the twenties when he did\n... gal so screwed up from to some dumb bug drag you down the fact that friends feel the urge bugs differs from the Sergio emerging attract sound advice from Doug slash clown\nSo smashed ... come you come you who lived to sheets as sweet let's choose topics heart make your heart competing claims man be sure hope God cures your body had defeat of God [laughter]\nIt's\nI carry it sounds to me like he sort of insulted by the question and and you have to remember\nHere is the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist you're saying is when are you just locking London or are you doing something\nMay be threatening you to be a who is withdrawing eight or withdrawing support in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this fellow oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards hey man [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in the twenties and independent journalists yeah I used to work in different newspapers and I was like you know when you when you listen\nTo what happened there and I felt like guys some kind of cultural a guide\nMe is that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space new series and I'm using a generally they say no or you could not\nExactly my point is how do you going to take sanctions maybe going to be the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk maybe who knows is that does the job description doing good ...\n[laughter] [noise] make so much think if you think this was from my numbers on there\nSo that conversation was about five months ago do you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out mother did he suffer for this question in any way now but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and sign up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] I and then it it's Gregory Gregory Warner all Greek all the audio and good I\nLike I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home in some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I started learning not to leave the room together them in the Arctic shipping and that uh\nThey said you shouldn't line up with the government's priority\nYeah these messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism task force will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf equally\n... out of the ones that are saying this kind of makes age\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome of the big where you know we've been given her doctor I'm the son just got caught in the wintertime comes and it might come ...\nNewspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSay my safety\nLead his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother good are they being your your it's Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that the what is your mom say she say please don't do that it's not good it might be you know without a gaping you things like that you know long shot like that they're yeah they're like that yeah\n\nMm So on\nMy us all and um\nYou know or use\nA\n...\nA ...\nB minus on\nRadiolab

... discovered a ... now you're try\nThis one or Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin twice George Carlin mentioned\n... biggest Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you don't have as a comedian for me to [noise] yeah [noise]\nIs about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all stay in the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time most is one of his great subject ever really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting to see was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of GOP next favorite\nColonel unrest and I really like this one too is about how Carlin hated\nEuphemism I don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms as an American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both as she called and we have normal people in this country norm are all people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these senior citizen\nIsn't that had he was considered that the reason we use ...\nI just been through my father in law died five four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill it's greatly I mean she's dying right and we wanted to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Carlin's real point was that it it does\nOur reactions to it that actually has like a kind of a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has this whole bit it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... directs language to sell those shell shocked and then it became battle fatigue metal fatigue for some of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausted [noise]\nHey we're up to age celibacy\nDisorder [noise] still a syllabus but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as they post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon this was the Orwell\nNotion that you could erase sensitivities if you bland it out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nRight resolution of it did get better as her brain learn to speak on it was awesome\nWhen I saw people living\nIn one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom it sent me showing her wearing the device and\nWalking down the street she told me they usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her so I uh [noise]\nYeah I hardly ever notice and if people walking around me it feels like\nI can always hear the topic and it's down to ...\nBut she says when she put the device on and put a sensor on her tongue [noise] the sidewalk\n[noise] came alive at night it was amazing like I didn't know this many people are on the street at the same time as they can now they're um [noise] down there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft raunchy\nRoss says he believes that can move\nThe Irish locking in a casino last living and I can see them again [noise] but I can I see them clear you know like I can see ... or whether they're wearing a shirt or a short sirt\nTo dress up has a just like see their shadow and every now and and I see the light counted on them really yeah\nI imagine some like underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jelly fish like yeah\nYeah I ...\n\nYeah like that\n\n\nIn that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue in New York City becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine

without a ride with them to meet the right to corner the shift their ... their ... ... you know you try\nTo you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes\nWe're going on an army fishing expedition sure sure if the here's here's the here's our quandary Karl Case religious at Georgia were doing Sean ... recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name all thing we're talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nHis I got a little insistence or just in a good year like our innate we gotta do are now yes I said that are not like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like no no I didn't\nSay that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence that's why I said yeah well as often happens\nYou or me down ... as I find let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town not secure your son's getting married yes he was and uh her I was doing like tech team worked for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure\nReally yeah it was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's the quick story so what happened was\nOkay so just to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson to figure it out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but he's the problems he like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy team piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff the stuff of us comes from ... yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins and our body different kinds of pertains to the question was like how how does all that get generated\nLike how did this for simple basis become the amino acids to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us how do you\nMake the transition people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved and the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma\nJust said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just ... this is a code problem\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nAnd then out comes the protein how what\nWhat simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side\nI think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a T. A. C. C. J. D. C. A. A. C. A. G.\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not hairs because if you have sets of three or rather than to the game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of\nProteins get now this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "15"}
