Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise] going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter]\n[laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started thinking you know what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of ... in the press how many people do is be killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMe right Jason Harris Sam dubose John Ritter animals become\nSort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending\nWeb streaming is made possible by states and harvest than a full service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at states dot com local level\nHowever uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way up by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers method for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBird so birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's\nEasier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida ...\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThank you sir\nBen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of would show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this to this is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh [noise] so a or B county book or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila photos with tons of papers in them spread across an entire desk\nAnd the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in the in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an orange stuff's packed was or chase [noise]\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and\nUm [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions from lessens some solutions\nJust all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by plane\nPast couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers showed that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like in the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas that whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there is some evidence of the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising\nNumber of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see\nOnce or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a data out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than\nIf you're white doesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and it's we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very far in present six kind of person he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we were and why we want to start\nThis nasty mask village moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this ah\nDeployment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife a department to five five at house every one of these every report this at least one human life\nSomeone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed\nOr should we have on this table the investigation but death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant folders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right now I'm having\nTo getting ... brown somebody\nMcVeigh and something happened in you know here in Florida\nAnd they didn't want to look at the club that nobody really wants to be hard\nRight\nOr so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom veiled on their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or no no just went under the noses Missouri and has been telling everyone about then\n... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this but as big as this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping for you right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way was that first of all gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the large stage a certain point because it was talking to these two women and she's had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says his age comes around you know I'm just [noise]\n\nAnd then I then went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house into and\nJuice talking to bend about his story crystal entered cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken now the guy\n[noise]\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nTo the summer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of houses\nWere sleeping each other bad on the couch you know the metric as it becomes like a huge sleep over in first of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other a lot of some sort of flies over shows results like therapy for us\nTo just let it pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... to ... when crystal let some of us over\nTo the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad\nCars like about twelve\nPeople him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that we can we just hang out on video streaming my mom\nMom's house probably over like right now\nAnd then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetable garden 'cause the guardian was here in vegetables\nAnd all\nThat I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here it's all you can smell which I have\nAnd so now like when you play any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association which one I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... in your time today and it brings you right back here mhm\nYep\nIn the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nSometimes we started ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best about what about appalling to me\nA couple of women handed me the phone it's like as long as you but\n[noise] and\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree to run\nWe all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nPretty hot even have access to ask I mean yeah we have an Iowa law\nIt was up to the ... we saw that last week and I and I threw o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's waited for about Fifteen minutes to talk about this\nAt home I have to go there all the time for\nBank yeah that was for its how could you not\nIt ain't no way you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because I used to listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out\nYou can do that as like a certain time every day and it's been a little white man we share\nEverything that I like literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day I mean I don't know if you if that's the way I like going on and all of that is a little white and got to always say not down\nHe take his chair again hold\nSo that you're to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nAre you write to me to repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown smother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nAnd it was around this time of the few of these women started called themselves the mothers ...\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife that you're not going down\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment any\nDay you're going to get you get\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and

guy would find campfires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\nYou're gonna do you're going to get it again\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he hospitals over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over and then she\nBecame central four cups and then\nThere may not have it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the police\nOfficer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot a warning sign your best shot I see that you want to die if you want to die you came back\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nTheir fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys we use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans into court judge established\nCommands first worn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... hey hey hey this is important as the guy's partner was holding a gun and have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nThere's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood if you miss it on the front steps waves of hatred what are you doing man dared doesn't stupid son of a bitch you don't have close came to be in bed wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs that he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners Daytona they just released his al ... county sheriff shit would was elected the sheriff of Linn county\nWhere I Am\nWhich is the county that the tone of each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a job with long his organization called her\nWhich decrease executive research forum it's a big coalition appreciate and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life\nNow just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie the international association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was a defense than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay tuned to\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation snatching public understanding of\nOr information about Sloan at

I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio that we had been discussing police violence and race mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe maybe\nYeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's the feeling we had a but then you realize\nHope it's a funny difficult thing um because well we'll let ... take it from here\nWe are here to see ... Tosh Clemens ... mother is Rodney Mitchell okay\nSo the ... the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center of ... other mothers who've lost children or that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben what's going to hand a ton of documents over ... on her son Romney's case 'cause she didn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview attach it but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started shopping [laughter]\n\n\n\nAnd\nAnd I just had no idea what\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off uh-huh so what was what was happening in that moment well okay so to back up so meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a ... a share of the police chief is that\nThe only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Rodney twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nNothing wrong it acted in accordance with the law\nAnd it just so happened that forty five minutes before that and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there and attaches apartment for a while we actually\nEven left for like an hour eventually came\nBack [noise] kind of just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\nMuch of the ... long dreads he's got a big smile mix smile right white smile and sat down in her kitchen table um okay so ah\nIf you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened shown eleventh two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college and out driving and touches car and that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying something going on with", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
