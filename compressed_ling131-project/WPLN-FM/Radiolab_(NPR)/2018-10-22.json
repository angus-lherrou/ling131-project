Hi I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping\nSo we thought we'd do is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make you wanna yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight Georgia how about what the song yes please\n[laughter]\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass door headquarters of\nFacebook and [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling from faceless nursing\nNurse in has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] now\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook one of the opening shots Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs boxer day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\n[noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't say that again by like ... what we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nThe on the Internet\n...\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr not come back I got to\nGive you some jak Italy prioritize or sensors ...\nCongresswoman we don't grow over during a censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe\nWhich made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to\nSwitch and just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote the extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nTime when I joined them there was a small group twelve\nSort of called this site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to thousands seismic changes this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face\nDot com is now the most visited website in the U.S\nFacebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things that come up onto their screen flags to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like I use or something that I thought was wrong exactly\nLike a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then\nThat content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were seeing was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards but they're at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture\nPop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nRise up sites for the lights that rather than\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirror those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just jump typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then changed their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for any policy on photos of women threatened leading their children down in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in the face to\nFace the best thing is not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington Post\nShow the Internet is a string of Dr phil it was a media storm\nAnd eventually\nPerhaps as a result of our group and our effort Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nI mean I Would guess what they're building Dublin where we sent reporters Guerra stack scene where they get there still is just so used to treat everybody fever English and we sent them\nThere to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow well we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like [noise]\nWell I'm going to ask you some sense or not we found out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nI'm Sorry sorry about the good work advice [laughter] Oregon so now I don't I start to buy these you know sorry she worked in but\nI Know your life in fact most people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NBA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather live that's totally fine you know ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct are headed for about ... watch\nSeveral reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company with\nGot to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you guys are\nSo this guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he'd show up to his desk every morning put on his headphones ignored ...\nJust like just like just like a forty five ... says every day I was just as much as ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like ... or it's too I have to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attached to you know people cages age or our cherry like\n[noise] Thirteen year old girl I'm having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch themselves thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were very specific like I said I couldn't watch it was like okay so ... ... us it was like okay so what I was like I had ... it was like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have to I I actually was too well [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's a classic case yes to\nA different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah for a job well yeah and it and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr that they're getting better automate that they yeah they ah through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks\nOf of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving onto our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke to me is hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back and I think we should\n[noise] Hi this is Jenny calling from Lima radio lab is supported by transfer wise online service that let people send and receive money internationally and their

[laughter]\nAnyhow so about a year into this running bit a martial law drawn to Facebook but a ... instead of seeing her normal loose feed a there was this message that pops up\nIt said you posted something that discriminated along the lines of race gender or ethnicity grill\nAnd so we've removed that post and so I'm like what can I possibly opposed it I really I I thought it was like a

kill all men and said hey you know because I had I had a it's funny you know it's just me whatever so um I posted\nImmediately after like yeah and it got removed again in this time there were consequences I got banned for three days\nBan shoot forward this is months later\nA friend of hers had posted an article and underneath it in the comments section there were a guy's posting just really nasty stuff so\nI commented underneath those comments men are Scott ... which was very quickly removed\nWhen how how long did you get banned for this time thirty days wow\nMake sure I emphasize that these policies they're not going to please everybody they often don't don't please everybody that's working on the policy team at Facebook but if we want to have one line that we enforce consistently\nBut it means we have to have some pretty objective black and white rule [noise] but uh\nWhen we come back those rules they get Tom\nThis is Jenny from Denver, Colorado radiolab is

tuning in an episode contains graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we do warn you that you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might wanna sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty three strikes\nAnd Carlos Rhonda Marilyn but sorry but if my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly\nCarlos Monday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nPressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line in

they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud ah there's a photographer there any snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photo shows that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nTo CBS feeding your studio on the other side of the country the next five me I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were\nClustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news right now\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so my\nMemories of watching some of the coverage chili new images just release of the Boston bombing remember seeing the photo published on line and it wasn't long after about\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise]\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is reading like wildfire across\nOutside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down at a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however half the rooms says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially the photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received push back\nWell I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff than other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can\nPull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down yes um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now and news organizations strength parents\nThere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is and this\nQuestion has been popping up a lot recently in fact did even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and bill ...\nBasically soccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable\nMuch of anything they're subject to defeat regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that\nHas been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting more important what what people find newsworthy\nNo give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slice of her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like", "show_name": "Radiolab
