I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nHappy Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said that I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three\nTwenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty they made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for this middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on a sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out to the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys\nGet really high and they knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing dumplings gave it a buck and I\nUsed to have been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBottom demand caught one of them\nDavid Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had them lay down in a ditch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and nuts began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by our there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID A thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife\nAnd the story was on every TV station that CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked\nWhen you're all are well one of the doors are large\nLoaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast that I'm aware that lasts\nLeft barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Guerra was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the man hawk it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead that he'd stolen a car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Guerra\nThese freeze or drop your gun something of that fact and scare started running\n... four times got 'em in the back the arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and\nJust in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but\nBut you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him [noise] they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk\nIt's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things to so fascinating about this case does it a law professor release alarm and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly age aren't many\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or are they [laughter] that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York this our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway or fighter I like ... flights go fights I like stand up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defending your fighting to state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert Guerra\nYeah life you're strong to promote you need a forty five and a or to head the fear I mean this guy is dangers and love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things wind won\nA schoolteacher headless shelf to his child he was sued the school and I talk to them a little bit and then head on all of them were actually represented\nThen pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that case got dismissed but then we kept ... for [noise]\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nAnd went into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nThen we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose a need to\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nThis may be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren ... and the town supervisor of Mariah ... father says it's on a road that goes to the miners are what is your up to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own

I was a good lawyer ...\nArt everybody um and now you know over forty years later\nWhat our money in Belgium did a\nGood body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if people face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client she represents his client's best interest if you've been in sitting in on these\nClasses and and talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer she should be\n[noise] [noise] ...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story\nI always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified that think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't\nThink it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminals who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal thought never mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling of the ... that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing wave flow immediately and and went to the police station and when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us\nLate there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic\nThat's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical about what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is why did they taught law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered any one law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I get it and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad says I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know you're going to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past few months later I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was\nToo difficult for us and [noise] and Danny what's your boyfriend had bad just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and\nSo to live and I'm sure the other two children get\nGreat future ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n\n\n[laughter] so it's horrible to be in the shooting\n[noise] I don't really know where would accuse the protecting the person to kill her\nNew justification you couldn't just to follow my mind\nExpects them but we lose\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt can you hear the\nEchoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the up the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's flu deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's dripping everything up here it's frozen solid so what that is [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Nashville",
