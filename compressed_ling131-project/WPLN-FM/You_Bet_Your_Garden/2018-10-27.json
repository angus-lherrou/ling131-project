three three seven to seven Ninety five eighty eight Phil welcome to you about your garden\nArgue well thank you feel how you doing man or a good and where is filled doing very good moral to New Jersey the Garden State so you must have a pool left the row of gardening chips to help us out with right bill\nAre by nature I think you're in trouble if you're looking for my health\n[laughter] well I'm I'm always in trouble fill it just seems to work out that way what going through your force are\nWell I have a peach tree\nSo oh you are you are in trouble [laughter]\nYou know after the first couple of years I got peaches I've got teachers want it for one year and then the next year dear ate all\nMy teachers ... and so I decided to put a fence around it [laughter] okay and\nThe next year I Believe the ... beetle got to it\nThat's pretty close to the uh it's a it's a we've all kind of a buck yeah slum Leo Leo\nYeah it it was as they got to about marble size and they would drop off and I saw the little cuts into the following year I got some spray and I sprayed\nSome Sprite and that's what it said on the bottle right fill sand will spray\nYou well it it it had a hard time finding it but it did say it would take care of that from Kurt kilo beetles yeah show so the same thing happened to take care of them were saying how they did they got about marble size and they fell off but it didn't have the little cuts Senate like the Trump Card you know fetal ducks\nRight because you know offense or you've never tried to investigate how to grow peaches you just kind of hope tinker bell would come and splashes in most areas dust every morning and you'd make peach cobbler at the end of the year peaches and Apple's are very labor intensive they are the hardest\nReal a really good the hardest plans for even commercial growers um eat a worse for whom per hour or so or peaches or as you know the tree grows wild bleak and peaches and Apple's need to be ... heavily\nEvery late winter early spring just as they do that\nReligiously every year okay good and you're taking out branches that are straight up crossing branches any damage would\nYes okay good well\nYou've got you've got a good start then it seems like the only other thing you're doing is you're not thinning the fruits\nNow I'm sending the fruit oh okay 'cause you're saying they're dropping\nYes and I mean I Would say I'd probably add three hundred teachers I'd probably ... or send them out to about a hundred\nOkay that's ... you know a hundred and fifty would be better oddly enough but no it sounds like you're on the right track I'm All right let's drop back then how um did you plant a tree yourself\nA yeah neighbor it give it to me oh it's been five or six years at least for now\nAnd was it boiled in burlap during a Potter bear route\nI uh I don't remember what I mean it's been growing for you know five six seven years now\nAnd ah have you ever gotten good peaches off of it\nWhat can we do for Lynn in indoor uh PA\nOkay um last year we planted butterfly Bush's and kind of flowers I like to attract my um the butterflies and among birds and if the if in such short route like gun flowers I was told I shouldn't have locked them all off at the bottom\nLast here in London ended\nUm I should've lasted that had that\nSame in such a for the third of the rent or is this true and if so when you're like I go out and how far do you like cut them\nA yes it is true ah one of the things we we have this cleanliness ethic we're we feel like the garden should be stripped bare in the fall but in truth the entire garden all of our wildlife all of our plan things are going to be better if we leave it alone\nNobody does this in the wild\nSo for instance you have a great example there are the dried seed pods of cone flowers that have you know go on the way of the turn all they do provide good food for birds at the beginning of the winter same with those big pods that followed the flowers on hostage implants\nThey are a great source of high energy food for birds and the answer to when you should cut your spent flowers down is pretty much never\nWhat you want to do is if after the birds have raided the flowers and they don't look any good and the more you can quote dad had them by just cutting them off a with a para pro owners right underneath the flower but leaving the sticks the stocks in place\nIs good for the survival you know your cone flowers or perennials they're going to come back next year\nOn last you cut them straight to the ground\nAnd we get a freezing cold winter without snow cover then that can freeze the crown of the plant and the root systems whereby if you leave those sticks in place there's more bio mass on top\nTo accept the harsh reality of winter and if we get snow snow gets trapped by those sticks and snow is the absolute best mulch over winter\nIt insulate the plant it keeps the temperature level underneath that snow cover it is the best mulch and when you leave those sticks and stems up it really protects the place\nYou'll be very happy with the results\nThank you so much time you're not a great guy you to take care I talked to get by by by [noise]\nWell it's time for me to take a little break and announced that next week special guest Holly ... the former director of the famed us botanical garden in our nation's capital will be giving a talk on healthy gardens for people in the environment at the Scott arboretum of Swarthmore College ten am fry day November\n... seconds but don't go check in the event section of our website bro the details just yet\nBecause we'll be right back with empty bowls that turned into happy homes and more of your fabulous phone I'm Mike McGrath and you're listening to you about your guard from W A L v the channel thirty nine in beautiful Bethlehem, Pennsylvania [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWelcome back to you bet your garden\nFrom P. B. S. thirty nine and beautiful Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\nI Am your host Mike McGrath and we have a very special interview segment for you right now catching kittens\nThis is the twentieth anniversary of our public radio show it is also the twentieth anniversary of me hosting a very special annual event held in the Philadelphia area\nWhich is the empty bowl dinner you see in front of us we have this plethora\nOf beautiful bowls will explain to you why they're here and\nWhy I Do this every year as we explore what this event is about it's a very important event\nUm with me is Rachel ... of the executive director of the interfaith hospitality network\nWho have grown up this annual event from a very small dinner party in to a crazed endeavor where everybody has too much fun Rachel welcome back to you bet your garden thanks so much Mike in our new digs what do you think oh it looks pretty good on you yeah [laughter]\nSo was it the first empty bold dinner when you called and asked if I could\nTalk about it on the air but sure was okay so Twenty years ago I had been on the air WHYY\nMaybe a month tops and you called about this event you were doing in November and asked if I could talk about it on the air and I said well it's it's not about gardening I mean there are soups involved there's vegetable soup that something but\nUm all that I can do or how about if I hosted and you said what would you do and I said I don't know I'll show up and figure it out kind of like I Do every week on this show and we've been doing it for Twenty years now um\nLet me explain a little bit about how it works because it's it's an immersive experience it's not just a dinner\nYou come in and you ... you guys see all these beautiful bowls in front of me will imagined a room with literally twenty times this many bowls all on tables around you [noise]\nUm and underneath the tables are more bull so when somebody picks out a bowl that they really like say this is this just a bowl that they're going to take home with them now this is a classy won this was made by a local power\nUm some people however you want a bowl that was made by a school child in the Philadelphia area and here's the one that I Would be taking home I Know there's some glare there\nBut they they made a ... and the ... he is in the middle of the bowl I just think this is absolutely sucking glorious yeah yeah and I just appear at the dinner over and over again because I got my favorite bowl but I Know every hour they'll change over so I'm always going to back in and\nTry to trade off my balls so the hardest part\nOf this whole thing is you have to choose your bowl\nAnd then you go into a gigantic room where there's tables set up\nAnd local restaurants have provided hot soups their best soups and don't worry you don't have to drive around the ... or wonder exactly what the school's job this blowout [laughter]\nBut ah there are disposable bowls all around and we have tremendous volunteers where did the kids come from who volunteer at this event\nOh the kids come from area campuses and high schools and even some junior highs all of the bowls are made by children and a Fifteen twenty different schools from around the area and then\nYou've got professionals again who are making this is my second favorite bolt this is my favorite\nUh professionally made bull I mean I Would buy this and the gift shop wouldn't yeah\nIt's absolutely gorgeous but again the bowls are all over the place in terms of their size shape a\nUsability I use my ex bowls is change things in the house or candy dishes so when you get your suit you get you get a disposable bowl that theoretically you'll use all night and then leave behind\nSo Rachel why are we getting together picking out a beautiful bowl and then sitting down commune ally and eating soup\nWill this dinner is always the week before Thanksgiving\nAnd it's a time when we're remembering what we're thankful for and we're also beginning to remember that there are so many people in our community\nWho don't have soup to fill their boats but they look at empty bowls every night and so people go to this dinner and they bring home a bowl\nAfter they've eaten there soup\nThat was one of the things that impressed me at my very first dinner is when you get your bowl you're told that you will take home your bowl at the end of the evening as a reminder of those whose bowls are empty all around the country\nThat's correct and um people have collections and collections of these polls the Pakistani or any [laughter]\nUsed for all different kinds of things but the main thing is that it's used to remind everyone about the plight of so many thousands and thousands of families in our country in fact two and a half million children\nWho will experience homelessness and hunger over the next year\nIt's devastating there was a statistic in the morning call the local newspaper here about the Allentown school district every day they served six hundred homeless children and they just hired a guy who seems like the perfect guy for the job\nOn German town avenue in Philadelphia much more information at our website you bet your garden got orgy ritual falcon thank you again thank you\n[noise]\nAll right it's not for me to take a little break in Grand Forks that I Will host the annual empty bowl dinner on Wednesday evening November fourteenth at the Lutheran seminary on Germantown avenue in Philadelphia you know maybe that's technically chestnut hill but one of my map quest\nThree seatings pick one pick your bowl eat lots of soup and make a difference but don't go looking for all the details of the event section of our website just yet because we'll be right back with unproven roses fig trees or they're not yet dead\nAnd more of your own dead phone calls I'm Mike McGrath and you're listening to you about your garden from PBS thirty nine in beautiful Bethlehem, Pennsylvania [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOh\n\n[laughter] [noise] oh\n\n[laughter]\nBet your garden from PBS thirty nine in beautiful Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\nI'm your host Mike McGrath and we're in the stretch now captain kittens in just a little bit we will get to the question of the week and Ernie Banks special we're going to play too it's so nice outside we're going to talk about why you shouldn't bring your roses now and what you should do to get things from that fig tree next season\nUntil then a couple of more beer fascinating phone calls at one\nEight eight no that's the number and must forget the old number must forget\nA three three seven to seven Ninety five eighty a caveat welcome\nTo you about your garden hello hello how you doing good how are you I Am just ducking thank you so much for asking what can we do oh where are you from I'm from things in Pennsylvania to okay if that if it's not quite cold country but you didn't get there from their\n... not too far away yeah All right what can we do for ... via in sleep sleeping ten did they make slate there did they mind slate is that one of them get him\nYet [noise] okay I got a cement roof that's\nMy question is my family and I asked one red maple tree was attacked by a swarm of the lot lovely spotted lantern fly flu and we're all wondering why we need to do with the trade if it's better to pesticide control it\nOr cut that down and burn it um it's a\nThirty year old tree oh man yeah it's pretty old okay\nGood now or the spotted lantern fly a you know I didn't think that they'd gotten as far north as slating ... and it seems to be going the other directions you know it was um it was down in the southern tip of ... county now it's been spotted New Jersey and Virginia\nBut these things are hard to miss so to speak they're hard to miss diagnosed and you say they attacked the tree in a swarm yeah which is what they do now what was your reaction do you do anything to get them off the trade\nUm they my my family and I pretty much let it alone and within two days the swarm Martha\n... park has already telling us that tree\nOkay because they are they are sap suckers and when they attack and those huge numbers yeah they can cause more damage than what I Would have urged you to do if we had spoken right then is to blow them off the tree with either a garden hose or even better a pressure washer but just a tiny bit of soap in it\nVery satisfying seeing them go flying in every direction and they'll be clean when they hit the ground\nSo what you want to do now is the ... do you ever feed it as a growing nearer treated lawn\nUm yes it's ... it's a tray deadline\nAnd okay what's the most with a cleavage spread Barclay\nSo get that away from there but that only weakens trees you've never seen a tree mulch denature have you walking through the woods or anything like that\nNow that the total human artificial reality the weakens trees and some of the colored ... are actually shipped up palettes from China that were insecticides soaked before they were\nShipped up and spray painted that God awful color so just move that mulch away from the tree because again that can only steel nitrogen and weaken the trick replace that with a nice mulch of compost but the most important thing is you want to really look\nTheir eggs cases have you done any online research to see what a what the egg cases [noise] excuse me what the execs they lay looked like yeah okay so you know they kind of looked like mud splatter somebody found any\nHave not found any\nOkay keep an eye out um if you do find any of the advice is just drop it into a jar with some alcohol or hand sanitizer inside um and then keep an eye out early in the spring the larval form the so called ...\nOf the spotted lantern fly they are really cool looking but they looked nothing like the adults did you see any of them they're kind of square Risch plant hoppers that are black with white stars covering their body\nNo other color it's it's it's actually really striking did you see any of those before the attack\nI have not\nOkay so next season you want to keep an eye out once you see those it means the lantern flies are coming next and again one of the best defenses is don't let them get started\nAs soon as they appear on great numbers on the tree instantly sprayed them off with really fierce streams of water\nI mean some people have a hose that can deliver a a good blast if the nozzle can be adjusted correctly but I liked the idea hitting them with a pressure washer a man that I'd sell tickets to that I'd watch them go flying all over the place\nAnd then I Would say once that cluster is gone the tree should be fine\nSo hopefully the tree and leaf that it leaps out nice every spring you got a good canopy on it yeah so that's really the source of the energy for the tree is ... and all the leaves still on the tree or they turning color\nThey're still on the tray\nOkay great great I I don't think the tree was severely damaged it may not look nice um but a tree that old that is still holding onto its leaves and otherwise appears normal\nShould make it but again get that get that would mulch out of there would mount she was not good for any plants\nUm get get about ... even if you just buy a nice bag of quality composed and mulch around the bottom of the tree don't let anything touched the bark of the tree and that'll give it a nice gentle feeding that'll allow it to pick and choose what nutrients that ones don't\nUse any trees spikes or any kind of a chemical plant food designed for trees and then just keep an eye out the biggest secret too successful organic growing is just be aware of what's going on with your plants everyday\nAnd when you see these really cool looking guys I mean they almost look like a dice\nUh when you see them get ready to blow the lantern flies off the tree up at the next site don't use the sticky paper they're um they're telling people to wrap around the trees it has wound up catching a lot of bats birds I actually saw wildlife rehab place that showed me a picture of a\nA a young red tailed hawk that had gotten caught in the sticky paper around the tree so there's better ways of handling these insects and um I think you're a trio will be fine in the spring\nThat's all right thank you so much for a out Oh thank you for calling to say bye\nBye [laughter]\nAs promised it is now time for the question of the week which I'm reading from a sheet of paper because they're too cheap to get me a teleprompter anyway we're calling\nRoses now and how can I get right figs yes instead double barreled\nQuestion of the week both questions from Lynn in Rockville, Maryland who writes my roses have gotten a really big gang delaying tall and big is this a good time to print them no it is not when in fact it is pretty close to the worst time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "You Bet Your Garden", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
