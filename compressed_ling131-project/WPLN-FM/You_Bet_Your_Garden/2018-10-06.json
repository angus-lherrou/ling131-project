I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right okay\nUm but my husband\nGave me one last year in July and it flowered twice for me\nAnd then I pointed out on the deck a plane and then later that he ran didn't leave them alone that a lot [noise] but I'm not reading again this year ...\nOkay well are you saying it flowered last year but not this year\nAnd it becomes much they're good at that are more four times that size now\nWell they're going to do that you know\nAnd it looks they knew what they said it but I don't know how to make a deal now\nWell you know it might not be anything you did or could have done this was a wretched summer by all accounts in southeast Pennsylvania the mid Atlantic states\nI mean we got something like a hundred and twenty seven inches of rain in June alone\nAnd all the plant Scott waterlogged there really wasn't a lot of sun and there when there was son it was too hot what do you typically do with this plant when you bring it back inside for the quote winter\nIt's my first year I don't know last year I had kept it didn't say and it don't twice I don't know what to do and I think ...\nSo here's the basic rules for bringing plants in from the outdoors\nOr you get a garden hose or a pressurized sprayer and you set the nozzle to its strongest setting you want like a laser beam of water you cradle the plant with one hand and then as best you can you really soak it down\nYou get the under sons who the leaves you get into all the little nooks and crannies and crevices\nThen you move the plant to another place\nExactly but because its roots are in the ground and it's a super hearty plant it grew back from the roots if you get a year like that where the peach in a pot it will die back to the ground as well and it will also stayed did [laughter]\nSo you know this was one of the hardest things in horticulture\nUm but there are times when we as gardeners have reached the point where we have everything we possibly can in the ground\nAnd it's time to do some Cohen um it would be difficult if not impossible to move the entire tree said to give to a friend out in the suburbs or something like that\nWell it it's a many\nRight what you mean it's a dwarf\nNow now it's a miniature ... tree\nHow how miniature is it terrible\nUh about four and a half feet tall some chai and they say are are supposed to be able to grow and hot [laughter]\nOkay yeah but what they don't tell you is that in um that's down in the Carolinas actually that's in a place without a real winter\nNow I presume you're on the court yard and you are protected but again this tree has a long tap root going into the ground and that makes trees very difficult to transplant\nI Would ... the existing tree\nGet another one and set it up in a big part in a protected corner that would give you your best chance because otherwise you'd have to take cutting Z and rooted to a different route stock\nYou know sometimes it's best to cut our losses on one of the things gardeners are our worst at is is getting ready to plants that are in in the right place so my advice would just be to buy it again cut it down or do you have a fireplace you know anybody who has a fireplace [laughter]\nI have fire places but they don't work\nThey'll okay if you know anybody seriously you as a fireplace or a woodstove when that would dries it's incredibly sought after apple wood and peach would will send the entire house if you just throw one branch on or to the rest of the fire\nBut that's my honest advice it wouldn't survive the move if you really like the tree get a new one get a great container for it put it in the sunnier spot and everybody's going to be happier\nOkay All right well of course I'm gonna try to move it anyway okay\nWell good good is that there's pictures we love a good laugh\nBye bye Bye bye\nAll right well it's time for me to take a little break it announced that I Will travel down south to speak about the importance of horticultural therapy when I appear to benefit for a very special healing garden on Tuesday October twenty third at five PM\nAt the beautiful country club of North Carolina in pine Hearst but go ...\nBut don't go check in the event section of our website for all the details just yet because we'll be right back with a man who gives poison ivy rash and more of your fabulous phone calls I'm Mike McGrath and you're listening to you bet your garden from W A L v shape in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania [noise]\nYes we will take more of your fabulous phone calls will also reveal why fleet Beatles love when you use chemical fertilizers but now it's time to welcome our very special guests an old friend ... the poison ivy horticultural is who is here to tell us\nNot only his great adventures and attacking tons of poison ivy in single landscapes but also have some good chips for homeowners to just have small amounts that they want to clear whom are welcome back to you bet your garden and a special welcome\nFor the first you bet your garden from Bethlehem P. at\nGarden on like great job [laughter] thank you mark\nNow you got your start at the Philadelphia Zoo but not as orders horticultural ...\nUm yeah horticulture listen grounds keeper Philadelphia's yes\nOkay so I'm wrong already ladies and gentlemen let's mark that time under one minute I've already made my first mistake you can place your bets now Vegas takes us [laughter] All right but how did you get so you're getting rid of poison ivy was part of your job\nUh yeah yeah it's a ... invasive plant and uh we wanted to get rid of it and I got rid of it uh mostly by getting it on my skin and\nCarrying it out like that [laughter] so then I had to\nGet a little bit smart and figure out some better tricks\nNow it occurs to me who Mart that are clearing poison ivy at the zoo could be quite exciting what if they're saying we're the gorillas or the tigers or a rhino is living\n[noise] yeah that's a real challenge and then the biggest challenges are dealing with the keepers to get them to okay everything\nClose all the doors lock him up and make sure the padlocks are on\nAnd then then you get about uh about twenty minutes until the zoo opens you got to be finished before the zoo open\nThe heat and I think I'm not hey guys I thought you said the gate was going to be locked\nYeah that's a real problem\nNow is there anything special about the zoo that it had a bigger poison ivy problem than other places or it was just you had this timetable in these animals who would like to play ping pong with your head\nWell we're on a fly zone were on one of the birds migrating fly zones and also a zoo being animal habitat so we had a lot of fruiting plants lot of 'em are apples a lot of uh\nThings that birds really relish so when they came to eat those things of course they're very generous and want to leave what they can give which is the scenes which er during their got those often include poison ivy\nRight and when they poop out poison ivy seeds they not only dropped the seat back onto the ...\n... ... double a it's a it's a double benefit\nDid you have any zoo animals that actively ate the poison ivy\nUm sometimes squirrels good after the poison ivy are but um are often times there it's not something that's available to them\nYou know because we hear about goats being used declare poison ivy and other invasive plants although we should point out right now the poison ivy as a Native American plant it may be considered invasive and problematic um but it's not foreign\nNo not at all not foreign\nAnd um I Know it occurs all throughout North America or or their poison ivy variance throughout the world\nI'm here in uh in Asia in I'm In East Asia or Japan or China and then western China and Korea and then\nDown further south in the tropical areas in a job in Borneo at the tops of the highest mountains it'll grow\nAnd more these plants you believe taken thereby migratory birds\nUm yeah over the millennium yup\nThat's that that's amazing um and you know that for many years poison ivy was not recognized as a problem you probably know Jefferson and Washington grew it has ornamental Z in their gardens they love the fall color of the leaves\nTo fall color is gorgeous\n[noise] so you got started when you left the zoo you for the company or you call yourself the poison ivy horticultural list\nAnd as I told you the first time I met you you have the best website name in the history of the Internet I don't want poison ivy dot com\nThat was a good one thank you Mike [laughter] and did you get started and obviously what your company does\nIs go around so landscapes and you get rid of the poison ivy do people ever call you for small jobs or basically do they call you when half of the landscape including the house in driveways poison ivy\nFrom one plant to fifty plants that it it ... it all depends on the ... the the placement in the landscape so it can be very it can be a very troublesome plant was just one\nAnd you have a crew of five a year\nWhere nine now yes true enough so business is good yes it is now you have removed from home landscapes some impossible to imagine ...\nYeah the largest single way of one plant was in Haddonfield New Jersey nine hundred and thirty pounds all that was just one poison ivy plane it was a twenty five year old plant\nAnd was that going up the side of a tree\nI was growing up inside of a choked cherry and reaching out and grabbing a second job cherry\nMan so what's the first thing you do when your crew ... I Know you brought your tools of the trade and I want to show this um bring it over to me because you have this hilarious a\nSo one of them are in addition to everything else you Ron I'm a poison ivy conference you've been doing this for many years now right\nYes ah since will be a a twenty Nineteen obey the seven conference\nAnd it'll be in March yes and how many days doesn't run it runs for what runs for two days now and ... and you train other people like you I'm to become poison ivy horticultural is you're kind of investing in your own competition\nYeah I Love to I Love competition I think I think competitions make make if you didn't if competition wasn't good for business Rite Aid wouldn't be across from ... [laughter]\nWell it's very good I mean there should be a poison ivy horticultural is in every state in the nation yes that's very true so your next conference is march twenty Nineteen and you always told them at the Philadelphia sip\nA yes this will probably be the last one at the Philadelphia this one coming up so if you want to or if you don't want him\nOn you can learn how to get rid of poison ivy and wait till the tigers get fed that's right\nAll right and all this information can be found at all I don't want poison ivy dot com boom or thank you so much it's always a pleasure to chat with you and thank you for being on the first show from the Christmas city Mike all the best luck up here in Bethlehem thing [noise]\nOn your host Mike McGrath and we're in a stretch now cats and kittens and just a little bit we'll get to the question of the week\nExplaining why sleep Beatles love when you use chemical fertilizers but first couple of more of your fabulous phone calls\nAt one eight three three P.
