All right much what can we do for Katie in Kentucky you\nKnow we get we're getting a lot of deliberation we had Pam in Princeton Katie in Kentucky you know I kind of what that\nIs one of those days I guess anyway I'm a kind of an outlet gardener um recently purchased my first come on and I clean it from there it\nCan ... I think that for that call yes\nI'm I'm [noise] last fall and they started to come up creating very slowly um but I read that they will come up slowly but they didn't really grow a whole lot\nUm but I started to know that from um ... and early in the summer so I think it was before they should have been dying back\nAnd I I don't want to economic trouble shoot 'cause I really really am looking forward to having some beautiful that\nOh you will you will um yes being ease or they go in the ground for the first couple years they spend their life force a growing nice big leaves the\nBig leap speech solar energy to the ... under knee\nAnd then after a couple years the player has the strength to produce those big flowers up which by the way or the best flowers for cutting and bringing indoors if you say you want your ... flowers for an event like two months later\nThey're one of the few blooms that you can cut bring inside just wrapped them loosely in slight lead damp um paper towels put them in the fridge and they won't change for much\nSo you know sometimes people want them for a wedding or something these are some these are plant you can store now you say you add spots on yours now where where we live here in Pennsylvania\nThe east coast a mid Atlantic states we had to rancho rains it was raining all the time and a couple of days it wasn't raining it was like a hundred and six so we watched a lot of TV um\nGot some minor let our air the therapy lacking in summer\nRight now or are they planted out in the open the getting good son or they\nAre they're getting really good for fun um\nI I've been listening care when I covered by like listen to like kind of cat hours upon hours and do and [laughter] and I know I and I don't have much up around that than\nUm what what catalogs and um I Know that when I called it back that want to understand what kind of looked like a damaged from that\nYeah exactly one of the things this mulch is just a marketing thing we should never be used in horticulture\nAnd especially in a wet year like that what happened is the most didn't allow this stems to dry out and then they can rock where they under the ground but luckily that ... you have in the ground is super strong now you pulled back the mulch right right\nYeah be careful if you still have it around that it's not touching the stems or the trunk of any plants out there um all of the plan things you see with wood mulch are wrong there just dead wrong but people imitate it and now you know we've got a landscapers dream all these plants are going to be dead in three years and need to be replaced\nBut you've done no permanent damage to the plant this spot you saw could have either been us spores from the woods ... which attracts fungal organisms in the environment and they they are known to shoot spores that cause things like tar spot\nOn plants also plans to get water too much from above where their leaves stay wet they just developing condition called leaf spot\nA which doesn't harm the plant it's totally temporary you get a nice year you get a nice year next year where the rains are not as ... and there shouldn't be any problem\nIf you're going to feed the plant just spreading the engine of compost around it but again even with the compost you don't want to touch the stems coming out of the ground don't feed it any kind of chemical fertilizer keep that would mulch away from it\nAnd come on your first year gardener you didn't kill it you have done a Ninety percent of the job\nNot on gas not death that\nIs the ultimate goal of any gardening you get to the end of the season and you didn't kill the plants and you can give yourself a parade down broadstreet\nRight so how long do you think I can I don't expect testing blend\nOf I Would say three years three years ago\nYeah but it's well worth the wait I have a pi any out by ... by a actually the road in front of our house a terrible place but it was planted long before I bought the house which was thirty five years ago\nAnd this sucker not only comes up every year it dropped enough seat nearby there to develop the sport I now have a penny of a different color growing next to the original one night so they will recommend\nAny ... or any taking forever I say it that ...\nWhen the not for the stems themselves what I Do is I ... some ah welded wire up into a cage like size\nInto his cylinder and then once the flowers are formed I'd just slide that underneath and try to make it on a ... foot so the flowers are up in the air and not hitting the ground\nOf putting on more fruits than a small country could ever use and they have the ability to hide until they become the size of a baseball bat you never get edible ones but you get one would be a lot of fun if you could slide them unknown into a major league game\nWell it's time for me to take a little break and announce it I'm going to travel down south to speak about the importance of horticultural therapy\nWhen I appear to benefit for a very special healing garden on Tuesday October twenty third at five o'clock at a beautiful country club of North Carolina in pine Hearst I better dress nice but

I don't I I don't think they're just proud\nAnd say okay so here's here's what we do we have somebody examine the wood that has holes in it that's a can of corn and trace the moisture problem\nSolved the moisture problem there may be a broken gutter dot a central air conditioner may be leaking something like that leaky pipes somewhere up there\nYou get rid of the moisture problem you replace the bad would and then you have to encourage the ants to destroy their own nest\nAnd all answer social animals they have a nest somewhere which could be probably is not in your house\nIt's probably outside your house and there's a queen out they're pumping out workers so you can kill all the workers you want\nWhen we get rid of the queen it's like the old aliens movies until you get rid of the queen ... Sigourney Weaver is going to be running around that ship nonstop Warrick acid is totally non toxic to humans but it's toxic to ants\nIf you put out a sugary bait that has let's say five percent um pork acid in it as soon as the workers eat that said they drop over dead they get the little X's over their eyes and everything\nBut if you make that bait one half of one percent for a gas it it doesn't affect the worker ants right away they take some of that base back they feed it to their fellow and it makes its way up to the queen\nAnd the poison is so slow acting if this does that it's a solid week before that first and let's call them murders a goes hey I don't feel too good and then he gets the exes ... but\nBy then it's too late to Bora gas it is all through that nasty that colony of thousands of ants the queen has been fed it over and over again and as soon as the queen dies as every woman realizes men without a woman to lead them are totally helpless they just stagger around they don't know what to do\nAnd then everybody gets a little X's over their eyes and you took care of a problem that can only get worse and more expensive it's they're almost like seeing eye dogs if you see ... and you see this kind of saw dust in your house you should kiss him on the lips\nBecause this moisture problem is not going to get any better on its own it's going to turn to rot and the longer it goes on treated the more expensive it's going to be\nIs so great and\nUh it's a very important time man\nFrom getting their house sprayed for no reason because it wouldn't have helped and you felt quite a few other people by talking to me about it\nWell I Am for a higher risk for heart failure right to your show and they just fired I have a yard", "year": "2018", "show_name": "You Bet Your Garden", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
