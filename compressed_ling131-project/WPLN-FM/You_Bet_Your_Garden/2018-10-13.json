[noise] All right that's what can we do for Katie in Kentucky\nYou know we get we're getting a lot of deliberation we had Pam in Princeton Katie in Kentucky you know I kind of what that\nJust one of those days I guess anyway I'm a kind of an outlet gardener um recently purchased my first come on and I printed Tom they're very canny I think that for that call yes\nI'm I'm black and they started to come up screen very slowly um but I read that they will come up slowly but they didn't really grow a whole lot\nUm but I started to notice some on men pretty early in the summer so I think it was before they shut up dying back\nAnd I just kind of wondering if you could out my trouble shit because I really really am looking forward to having from the status\nQuo you will you will um ESPN knees or they go in the ground for the first couple years they spend their life force a growing nice big leaves\nBig leap speech solar energy to the root underneath\nAnd then after a couple of years the plant has the strength to produce those big flowers up which by the way or the best flowers for cutting and bringing indoors if you say you want your ... flowers for an event like two months later\nThey are one of the few blooms that you can cut bring inside just wrapped them loosely in slight lead damp um paper towels put him in the fridge and they won't change for months\nOh wow yeah so you know sometimes people want them for a wedding or something these are some these are plants you can store now you say you had spots on yours now where we're\nDelaware all up and down the east coast the mid Atlantic states we had to rancho rains it was raining all the time and a couple of days it wasn't raining it was like a hundred and six so we watched a lot of TV [noise] um\nGot some minor let our hair the ferry lacking in summer\nRight now or are they planted out in the open they're getting good son or they\nAre they're getting there and they got it for fun um\nI I've been listening care when I discovered you know I like listening to like kind of ... cats hours upon hours and do and [laughter] and I've learned a lot and I don't have much other than\nUm what what chat locks and um I Know that one I pulled it back that one at that time and it's kind of looked like happen or damage from that\nYeah exactly one of the things of this mulch is just a marketing thing we should never be used in horticulture\nAnd especially in a wet year like that what happened is the most didn't allow this stems to dry out and then they can rock where they under the ground but luckily that ... you have in the ground is super strong now you pull back the mulch right right\nYeah be careful if you still have it around that it's not touching the stems or the trunk of any plants out there um all of the plant things you see with wood mulch are wrong there just dead wrong but people imitate it and now you know we've got to landscapers dream all these plants are going to be dead in three years and needs to be replaced\nBut you've done no permanent damage to the plant this spot you saw could have either been us spores from the woods most which attracts fungal organisms in the environment and they they are known to shoot spores that cause things like tar spot\nOn plants also plans to get water too much from above where their leaves stay wet they just develop a condition called leaf spot\nA which doesn't harm the plant it's totally temporary you get a nice year you get a nice year next year where the rains are not as ... and there shouldn't be any problem\nIf you're going to feed the plant just spreading the engine of compost around it but again even with the compost you don't want to touch the stems coming out of the ground\nDon't feed it any kind of chemical fertilizer keep that would mulch away from it and come on your first year a gardener you didn't kill it you have done a Ninety percent of the job not\nOn death not death that is the ultimate goal of any gardener you get to the end of the season and you didn't kill the plants and you can give yourself a parade down broadstreet\nRight so how long do you think I can I don't expect testing blend\nOf I Would say three years three years ago\nYeah but it's well worth the wait I have a pi any out by ... by a actually the road in front of our house a terrible place but it was planted\nLong before I bought the house which was thirty five years ago and this sucker not only comes up every year it dropped enough seat nearby that that developed the sport I now have a penny of a different color growing next to the original one night so they will recommend\nAny Cajun or any taking forever as I get thicker\nWhen the not for the stems themselves what I Do is I ... some ah welded wire up into a cage like size\nBecause this year where you live you gotta hellish amounts of rain but it's not it wasn't just horrendous it was ridiculous um zucchini is a funny plant it has this reputation\nOf putting on more fruits in a small country could ever use and they have the ability to hide until they become the size of a baseball bat you never get edible ones but you get one that would be a lot of fun if you could slide them unknown into a major league game\nWell it's time for me to take a little break and announce it I'm going to travel down south to speak about the importance of horticultural

I don't I don't think they are right I just little ... and say\nOkay so here's here's what we do we have somebody examine the wood that has holes in it that's a can of corn and\nTraced the moisture problem solved the moisture problem there may be a broken gutter dot a central air conditioner may be leaking something like that leaky pipes somewhere up there\nYou get rid of the moisture problem you replace the bad would and then you have to encourage the ants to destroy their own nest\nAnd all answer social animals they have a nest somewhere which could be probably is not in your house it's probably outside your house and there's a queen out they're pumping out workers so you can kill all the workers you want\nUntil we get rid of the queen it's like the old aliens movies until you get rid of the queen ... Sigourney Weaver is going to be running around that ship nonstop Warrick acid is totally non toxic to humans but it's toxic to ants\nIf you put out a sugary bait that has let's say five percent um or a gas it in it as soon as the workers eat that they they drop over dead they get the little X's over their eyes and everything\nBut if you make that bait one half of one percent for a gas it it doesn't affect the worker ants right away they take some of that date back they feed it to their fellow and that makes its way up to the queen\nAnd the poison is so slow acting if this does that it's a solid week before that first and let's call them murders a goes hey I don't feel too good and then he gets the x.s on his eyes\nBut by then it's too late to Bora gas it is all through that now that colony of thousands of ants the queen has been fed it over and over again\nAnd as soon as the queen dies as every woman realizes men without a woman to lead them are totally helpless they just stagger around they don't know what to do\nAnd then everybody gets a little X's over their eyes and you took care of a problem that can only get worse and more expensive it's almost like seeing eye dogs if you see carp and ... and you see this kind of saw dust in your house you should kiss him on the lips\nBecause this moisture problem is not going to get any better on its own it's going to turn to rot and the longer it goes on treated the more expensive it's going to be\nSo great and care\nOh it's a very important topic and I love when I can stop people from getting their house", "year": "2018", "show_name": "You Bet Your Garden", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
