to add we ought to impose sanctions on any of those that were directly involved in this murder\nSenator Durbin tells NBC there is even more the u._s. can do\nWe are expel formerly expel the Saudi ambassador from the United states until there is a completion of a third party investigation into this cutting the murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in Istanbul\nSen Paul ... the U.S could go even further\nI feel certain that the crown prince was involved and then he directed this and that's why I think we cannot continue to have relations with him\nAnd so I think he's going out to be replaced frankly and he says the U.S should use its leverage the Saudis need as much more than we need them we haven't brought them all leverage their air forces entirely Americans lions\nThey can't last a couple of months without parts and mechanics to help them run their air force trying their pilots they're completely dependent on us when we need to tell them to that hey\nMichael All right thank you Linda Kenyon reporting for first light from Capitol Hill Eighteen before the hour now when we were just hearing from Senator Rand Paul when this story first broke a couple of weeks ago\nThe senator or put together some legislation to block this arms sale at that time\nWhen very little was no and he was only about four votes short of getting the Senate to pass a cancellation of that arms deal and I would imagine that by now with such stalwart are supporters of Saudi Arabia as Lindsey Graham now turning completely against them that\nThat that Paul uh legislation would probably pass and kill the deal of course President Trump says he doesn't want that to happen\nThe president talks about it as a one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal\nUh actually it's not really a deal it's really a memo uh been kept saying that well this is what we would like to do over the next step you know ten Fifteen Years this is what we'd like to do as of yet they've only signed letters of uh of intent there is no actual contracts with is the deal is kind of ephemeral at this point\nAnd there'd been widely burying interpretations of the benefits of bad job the president says\nAh it would create five hundred six hundred thousand jobs the Pentagon says maybe a couple of ten thousand maybe twenty or thirty thousand the president says five hundred six hundred thousand dollar jobs are available\nAnd so far the Saudis I've really only agreed to about fourteen and a half billion dollars in sales and ask for things like helicopters and tanks and ships and weapons and training\nAnd uh and but of course the deal would allow them to purchase up to a hundred and ten billion dollars over the next ten years but whether they do or not is not actually spelled out in that so it's kind of an ephemeral thing that's what's at stake though and that also is at stake is the role of America as a beacon of democracy around the world\nWhat do we do do we sell weapons to a bad guy even if sometimes that bad guy helps us out 'cause sometimes you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend so there are no easy answers here so [laughter]\nYou know what would you like your senators to hear

are now on for a slide and we were talking about arms sales to Saudi Arabia right now there's actually a hold in the Senate on the proposed deal\nBy the way the Congress works is that the the two ranking members of the top Democrat the top Republican of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the house foreign affairs committee any of those four people can put a hold on anything like this and in the Senate it was done by Senator Bob Menendez\nWho is the top Democrat in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he did that actually back in June before any of this actually happened\nHe put a hold on it so right now it's actually kind of hung up in the Senate anyway if he were to lift his whole then you have a thirty day review process that begins in any member of the Senate and then at that point file a resolution a disapproval which would block the arms sale and Congress would have to vote on it right now it looks as if\nThat would pass the Senate the house or I don't know that anybody who's done a nose count there\nAnd it's also a little difficult because everybody's back home campaigning including senator Menendez who's got a tough race up in New Jersey coming up on a
