Katy RS speaking of the White House in our president or he recently held a a roundtable discussion\nIn the wake of the Florida shooting regarding\nA video games of violent video games and what impact if any they may be having on our youth and or their behavior\nAnd one of the individuals who was called to for that meeting was our next guest his name is Dr Douglas genteel he is a professor of psychology at Iowa State and Doug thanks for taking the time to join us here on the big five fifty K. theorists\nOh it's my pleasure although I should clarify that I was uninvited audited by that meeting a which I guess suggest that the media industry thinking too dangerous\nTo go you know I'm Sorry I got it well but\nYou're one of those who feels that that video games can certainly add too aggressive behavior amongst our young as ... are you is that in my\nLife I think the way you're raising it is really very important\nTalking or there's a difference between the aggressive behavior\nViolence yes and that's an important difference aggression as much\nAnd violence yeah [noise] uh and that's\nAn important difference aggression is much broader aggression can be a physical can be verbal it can be relational where you're like me or use your relationship to harm someone like giving them the cold shoulder or it whereas violence is physical only\nAnd severe it's really extreme such that if successful would cause severe bodily damage or die\nSo it's a really narrow and extreme some type of aggression and there is a lot of research on not just video games with other media TV and movies going back into the Nineteen sixties that does shows that are kids who watch a lot of media violence\nDo become more willing to behave aggressively when provoked and that's a really different thing from saying causes school shootings which and often the way this uh this gets in your own misinterpreted or in in the public domain\nBut if they are more aggressive as a result of their exposure\nTo these games are and they tend to be\nConfrontational and or your ... your correct me if I miss categorize it but to what we might call troublemakers or problems\nOr or have issues a debt aggressiveness can be act it out in in sometimes violent behavior or at least a you know ... if nothing else they get they get in fights or something like that for\nThe building burning down\nIn all those folks\nBasically burned alive\nA couple of them got out one is David ... who wrote Waco a survivor story who joined us on the program and do you tell you that we're looking at something a quarter of a century ago\nWhat does that feel like you or is it just like it was yesterday\nDavid oh that was the actual question that was a surprise to let's say you're not actually a very very hard to follow your lungs when that's okay this is when it was funny it was so long ago that the others there's times where it seems like it was yesterday times where it seems like it was\nForty five years ago you know there there have been tied it was like you know Fifteen Years yet or sit there and you're watching TV or an image comes up is burning building you know you go I was there so it's a swear how life works\nYeah we are today can die on the outside looking in behind the safety of like an FBI and you were in a burning building and one of the few people to get out which\nWhich cover that particular and if things what do they feel like on the inside because standoff went almost two months [noise]\n[noise] yeah you know yeah it was fifty one days there was like everyone was hungry in the shower that's for sure\nAnd of course there was a sleep deprivation or the or the speaker systems playing music twenty four seven [laughter]\nWell I wasn't really music they play like sounds of rabbits being slaughtered all kinds of psychological they try to get he puts on edge really I'm I'm actually pretty surprised that no one shot speakers up during the ... you want to do\nThe hippie I always talk about the FBI certain restrict that not shooting at us which of course they did on the last day but I think the people inside showed a lot of restraint not shooting the speakers though the course of you know however many days it was being bombarded with that kind of Richard noise\nUm yeah I Know you you asked about the fire together I mean I was I came out of the side of the building where the cameras could still like him or the older parents made with three other people so more people survive him out\nOf the area that I was in\nAnd I imagine you probably saw you are just going to be a moving target once you got out of the building\nI really did I mean I I went to the very last second literally the wall that was next to be caught fire like you're like here since you or you know because I thought it was going to be shut I really didn't\nThink I Would be here to tell the tale\nUm fortunately for me which I didn't of course realize at the time I came out on the side of the building where the cameras even though they were two or three miles away can still see\n'em we have the majority of the kids especially with the concrete structure the back and the women and you know one of the children of course a few of the men do [noise]\nUm at the back of the bill and no one survivor came out a lot of averages would say if that's where the kids were but that's where the majority for the people that come out the back and I like to refer to a documentary called the rules of engagement that features\nAn infrared video that plane that was flying above the ah the the the building that day two miles above that and for a technology which shows like ... or ... feet sources is white and at the school that shows that this dark side\nTo it it's like a black and white video on right source yeah anyway we have a couple of different a flashback looks like they could be parts\nWe have a couple of different a flashback looked like they could be part technique devices in areas where the fires begat but we also have several shooters to rate next there's two tanks next to each tractors fully automatic weapons fire being fired\nInto the building [noise] I I bring this up because you know recently there was a documentary they documentary it was very well balanced up until the end of the mix still claim that it was a mass\nSuicide and the FBI of all the FBI guys on there saying help them I Wonder what the children of the cronies built\nAnd you know the answer to the ad is it's hard to bring children out of a burning building if you're being shot down when you're speaking with Bill but we also have several of your top three fourths of bullet almost to the center of the chest and the center of the head that's not how you commit suicide [noise]\nI just bring this up either I'm sick and tired of of the media calling this a mass suicide if anything it was a mass homicide\nYou know and I apologize if you have any um listeners that that don't want to hear what I have to say but everything I'm just saying as we can prove that there is evidence do it it's just the evidence that no one wants to talk about\nWhy was the big question for me just watching that unfold like so many is here we're negotiators there were conversations for a month and saying you need to come out and no one would ban done that\nYeah that's true I mean you know one of the things that what happened is there was mistrust between David Lee FBI FBI and the you know to believe things they were staying and the people inside the loop anything the guy was saying a lot of that was because we didn't have a few\nOf the FBI goes cheaters that we were kind of working well west and the government would either put on a new\nPerson after we built to report and take the you know take one person off\nThe or they would they would start lying about it for the press conferences and it would be like the negotiators would tell us one thing and the press conferences they would say another thing that of course that was because the go she said no control over what the ... commander said in dead and then we're the ones that control the press [noise]\nSo you know the course of the fifty one day is it really we just did not believe what they had to stay more and more and more and it really just kind of put his latest stronger as a group and stronger are willing to not want to come out\nDavid ... joined this weekend was survivors story out from him and being a resident of the branch civilian compounds for\nA couple years leading up to that saying you know to say that that he was involved in in the midst of it certainly an understatement let's go back to your start with the ... and getting involved with the branch divinity and\nYou were you a lock drummer you had no religious affiliation is any kind it is in my experience that that people that get involved with\nWell all the false profits because David ... she's been viewed as such by many people like that they tend to follow them to wherever kind of the laws don't had their way we're beat up by their family don't know what they're doing you don't seem to mold\n[noise] yeah I I I think a lot of the people there didn't fit that model but I mean most are\nSpeaking for myself and then I'll get it in some of the other individuals [noise] um I really wasn't looking for religion whatsoever I knew that there was a power to the scripture\nAnd I never believed the TV preachers never watch TV creatures and I ... I I couldn't understand why people would spend the money [noise]\nUm I could I I always kind of thought that I was seeing through something there um I watch Sunday school a lot of it didn't make any sense whatsoever to me you know I I just simply met someone that had a different attitude they really when I met David sleeps diner they treated the scriptures the study as it was something that\nThey didn't just you know take a few lines here and there and say this is what we believe [noise] they were able to go genesis to revelations during the entire scripture all the minor a major profits\nHave basically show a plan for the final days and it was who was studying you know I mean are there was one day I remembered Steve opened his Bible on the one inch marching marching Bible with a big margin on the side and every single\nPages color coded and reference and it's just like they had really gone through it and I was very impressed with that it was like I said it was more of a an intellectual study that it was a religion I kind of kind of became that a little more as time went on course you know Dave ... these days which at the saddest things like that a lot of the the Jewish tradition\nBut you know I mean here I Am branch will be will be played a little music with him he liked to what he was doing but you ended up moving your whole life ends when George his compound\n... was kind of surprising you know I mean I basically I became convicted I started to see the scripture take on a whole new dimension that I never thought it was you know I I always thought that um I Would be able to see through\nAny individual to show me the scripture or you know when you meet somebody could actually answer your questions and show you where the shop scriptural its its interests me I just gave it a point where I knew I had to go through this experience to the ad I had to get through\nYou weren't silly Asian and your alignment with the branch dominion exist to this day is that is that ... to you when people call you a branch in Indian\nYeah I don't see myself as a brass divinity and I never did we never\nI didn't know that the people at their breasts videos and so the attack and the next day the principal said with a brass diversity and you know building they were saying cop out I said building are dispatched to really know but you know they were trying to express their videos that the first time I really realized that that's\nWhat we were called um but of course I was familiar with the past which would be you know I'm the slowest road and the brother out if they they were the videos that\nFrom being there and watching David\nUh when he gave us the it was like he lifted it wasn't like he was just giving you a study and I remember when the very first day of the study you get the scripture without but he said this is the two pieces of leather couch whether\nIt with a bunch of pages in between some people try to figure out the whole was put up to us for it and he said I feel really panoramic Lee from Jennifer ... if it's happening right now and I thought that was at a at a credible state but to make I didn't believe it obviously over the course of the next two weeks he really try to prove that he didn't see the scripture that way\nHe recorded a lot of things along the way in those teams many of those tapes survived the siren and I said some of the uh the changes on television shows and various things she talks about being a messiah um how did that with you\nWe actually talked about revealing of first deal he only got the first you're completed that was one of the things that that you know\nThrough Leslie tapered Arnold to religious scholars that were on ... radio show that we were listening to um they have the player the right to seven she'll manuscript out yeah of course that he was bluffing with that he finished this the first seal the day before the raid on April mighty [noise]\nShe's with the cable yes yes so you have that came about from you know the person I was route\nOr the ... route turtle was typing it out and she came out of the of the ... of the building with that first film industry concrete it so you know the FBI so that was why but he actually take very seriously and he was working on writing it all out\nYou managed to get out of the building was on fire and through a whole made a in a tank in a few people were able to make it out very few by the way a and a couple of them that did went to jail so\nYou you avoid death but you also avoid prosecution how did you manage that\n[noise] I I honestly I just feel like I Would walk he has people that has ever lived I don't I don't know I Know that my mother was on the ground there and she was Bush short on every show that she could to kind of raise awareness of family voices that that that these people aren't\nYou know that they are part of their families are outside families and the patch you but the the parents a chance to speak to the end of the their loved ones that are staying in a car most the time it was\nThat you had an attorney that I think it was really good and and like the news from the judge Will Smith it just seemed like there was a bunch of favors for you in my factor\nIt's not the guy had any control over I was thoroughly prepared to go to jail even though I didn't believe that I was guilty of anything [noise] um I just don't have the system works but I you know okay say and I just got very lucky and it's really no no nothing that I have to keep me out of jail just happened\nWhat do you do and now David\n[noise] well I still play in a ban on the weekends even at my age and [noise] um yeah I I I kind of an entrepreneur I sell stuff on line and that's that's it\nAnd the book certainly are\nAvailable it is called
