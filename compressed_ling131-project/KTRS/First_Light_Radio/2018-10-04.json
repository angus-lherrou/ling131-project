every other year it violates the law companies also face a one hundred thousand dollar penalty for not reporting it's boards agenda ratio to the state's secretary of state\nMichael All right thanks Jim Rupert coming up on Nineteen before the hour now and there are a lot of issues related to this is not even clear that we would get women to actually joined boards in California about thirty business groups and as John mentioned the California chamber of commerce oppose the law\nWhich may or may not pass legal must her and there are questions about how many companies in California it would even apply to not still this bill is actually based on our requirements and a number of European countries that they have passed\nAnd uh it is actually has worked fairly well over there evidence suggests that are having more gender and racial diversity in the boardroom is good for business\nAs a group called the Peterson Institute and found that the presence of women on corporate boards and in the sea sweet may contribute to from performance and that among profitable companies move from no women leaders to thirty percent representation\nIs associated with a Fifteen Percent jump in profit some European countries like Germany Sweden Iceland Finland and France they have quotas and finds requiring that the companies have to add women to their boards or Norway I think requires companies to give at least forty percent of their director seats to women\nAnd they say that uh some of the folks over and those countries who resisted it initially said that once they've actually experienced it a change their minds and they've kind of warmed up to quotas [noise]\nBut that's in Europe quotas have a different a different reaction in this country we are not crazy about being told we have to do things even when we know they're right\nBut we all know that when you bring in women and and people of color anybody who's got a different life experience into perspective\nThan just the same old viewpoint especially on things like ... it makes a difference and a lot of companies on their own of course understand that they're looking outside of their own companies maybe to bring in candidates who are a little more diverse and my uh [noise] you know refresh the gene pool a little bit and that's what this was about but the question is\nWhen you start mandating it\nOne size doesn't always fit\nAll well you know just just doesn't work all the time\nAnd we don't know if this was going to be good for women will they be looked upon as serious members of the board if they're on there because they are quote unquote hires so it could be because of that can be bad for them all and make some women who feel like\nI've worked hard to get to this position I'm qualified for this position I've been here a long time I'm On the board but now people look at me as if I'm a quota hire may may not like that so we have a lot of questions to go through\nWe had a lot of opinions to go through and of course this is a time when\nUh the relationships between the sexes are fraught with all kinds of issues that have such a difficult time this is just one one more thing\nAnd of course I Know a lot of folks will say you know what we do need to have diversity but we should do it only as the marketplace depends and others will say well if you're white for the markets to come around and and grand for corporate culture to change\nThat's not satisfying for women who want their equal representation now not when they're older when they're dead so you know what's the answer here I'm looking
