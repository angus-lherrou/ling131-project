superhero game with Iron Man in the dark Knight in two thousand eight so that we get to see Tom Hardy is facing this movie for a change yeah actually that's strange to actually see him delivering the

had situations before they hold held a crucial floor votes open for hours and hours while they were waiting for a senator to fly back home district\nOh one one such case a senator a lost a parent\nA parrot parrot it passed away was at the funeral and they waited for him to come back on their plate\nSaid yes yes so you know um this is this is a wacky situation and I'm getting stranger by the minute\nYeah she she sent here and I quote a GOP leaders court have literally not said how they will manage his absence for the vote now the clock is ticking so they actually have a schedule that they're supposed to follow so we have a I guess a tell us about the first procedural vote today\nThe first procedural vote isn't about five hours from now and\nUh when you're on the east coast five hours from now\nYes yes and uh it it's called cloture it's procedural it's a a\nIt's a hurdle that has to be able to come before they can go to the final vote cloture is basically a motion to end debate in other words that sets the parameters for the debate\nSet the hard and time and the heart and time is thirty hours they like to say thirty hours post culture right so if we do the math that means that the final vote that after the thirty hours will\nCome on Saturday but now with the Steve Dane situation or that kind of throws a monkey wrench into the whole\nThing maybe now they're going to be doing a wedding during the Saturday morning brunch or something of an hop on a plane so the thing about cloture vote which is now it happens I mean it's not it's not like a regular thing but it does happen often enough where they have to be concerned\nAbout somebody might vote for cloture just to move the process along but not been go vote the way the leadership wants them to on the final vote so it's possible we could see\nYou know all the Republican senators vote for cloture just to keep this process moving and then maybe ... vote against Kavanaugh when it comes to the final vote so maybe people shouldn't get too excited about what happens today the\nOnly thing that would uh be very interesting in terms of culture of keeping in mind what you just said is if they don't get enough votes\nFor core event it fails all been done what is the what do they do have to Venice just isn't just over at that point\nIt is over at that point they cannot proceed to a final vote if they do not get cloture first\nYou've been up on the hill and you've been I guess a feeling really feeling the heat and all the uh strife up there and attention now I've heard some people say that the Democrats want this thing over more than the Republicans do do you get that feeling\nI think everybody's tired of it um I think that the Democrats a bar in a situation now where they're still vehemently opposed to this nominee debt if but if he does get confirmed that they can use that in the mid term\nI'm as a campaign rally if he doesn't get confirmed they can use that in the mid term says I Can't pay\nWell it seems like this whole nomination thing is turning some Senate races around and it may cost them there was a small chance but they at least I've had a shot at taking control of the Senate just seems to be hurting that because it's turned out the Republican base the Republicans their their\n... and uh they didn't do Jasmine Guy for Democrats as pretty much closed which means that\nIf you are in some of those swing states do probably not swingers time if the Republicans turn out as much as the Democrats will\nAnd maybe they're just hoping that people will forget about this and go back to being complacent by the time or they'd be election comes along well yeah\nI mean anything is possible that it seems like you know this whole thing has energized both the conservative base of the Republican Party and the Democratic base of the Democratic party because they really really are or she was very emotional and have very strong feelings about the situation\nCylinder we're coming up at about sixteen before the hour or so I Want to quickly how do you describe how this a reading of this and it's not really an investigation it's really just a supplemental investigate a supplemental background check report is not really an investigation that just took some information of course the Democrats they were you did an interview about twenty or thirty people who are witnesses and have things to say\nSome of these people have actually been calling and writing and trying to get in our waiting hey FBI over here you got to talk to me I Know stuff and the FBI of course did not do it\nNot because they probably didn't want to but because it seems as if we're getting conflicting reports\nThe White House is saying well you know there were senators told us to to do an interview and the senators are saying we had nothing to do it if they're well we'll find out when the books are written what's the what the story is there but tell us how when this information was transmitted up to the shop to the Senate what senators have to do to see this\nIt's a very unusual situation\nBecause of the uh heightened emotions in that particular nomination they've decided that the senators a coup by the way are probably still reading the report right now uh are going to a secure room in the Senate that big capital a visitor center on the Senate side of the center\nUh it's usually use for intelligence briefings to secure a room\nAnd it's called skiffs and that they that that's an acronym letter look back over the dance floor because it just flew out of my head but the\nYou know as soon as I Know what security isn't there a facility as last word I forgot what the other ones are for\nExactly but it's basically it for growing up silence\nExactly exactly for those we remembered that\nI Do have a ... I'm very old [laughter] well\nThey go into this gift a one hour increments there's only one copy of the report should be shared by all one hundred senators\nI read that they were reading aloud to each other\nYeah there's a conference room in their um they've been sitting around the conference table and they've been a reading aloud different sections to each other\nOr they have their allow 'em there's only a certain number of people who are cleared to go into the skiffs and it includes like one eight and a and the senators themselves and\nYeah that's how they're doing it they're going and then this one hour increments they are uh sharing this one copy and uh\nUh sharing this one copy and uh and it's\nIt's ... it's a very unusual situation they're not all that they can take notes but they can't bring out with them they can't take any copies of the report itself out with them a Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia they Democrat is running for reelection in ... West Virginia\nA was a key came out of the skits yesterday and he was\nWas that kind of had sort of in a painful look on his face when I asked by reporters you know ... what are you going to do and he said\nI haven't decided I'm going back into read it more morning that would be now and and uh he could be in there right now\nAll right well I I understand some of the senators may end up voting before they are allowed in there to see it although uh I I Would assume that may be there if they maybe they have kept it open all night it's very interesting to find out such cloak and dagger mystery I mean it's it it would give to sort of a of a\nCeremonial aspect ceremonial what's the word I'm looking for but if it makes it more dramatic you know when you're dealing with things like that so now you've got to go into a secret room somewhere and then they only have one copy and you can you know and they're not supposed to talk about this the public is not supposed to know what is in this report but I think\nBoth sides do want to release it so they were good Republicans going to say look see there's nothing in there and the Republicans can say look there's nothing in there so [laughter]\nYeah yes exactly exactly it's\nIt's it is very cloak and dagger it is very unusual um normally FBI background checks on judicial nominees are kept private because there's some personal information at their\nUm you know Social Security numbers things of that nature Dale public but the Democrats really wanted this to be made public with those personal items redacted that of course was rejected\nAll right Linda I Want you to bulk up on a lot of energy foods this morning 'cause we are going to be hearing from your all day and all I'm sure you're going to be working around the clock all through the weekend or will ah\nWill do a better plan interested in hearing on Monday morning on the first line well what happened over the weekend listen thank you so much for joining us I Know you had to get up early to be with us [laughter] thank you Linda can you on our Capitol Hill correspondence is not twelve minutes before the our unfair slide we're going to take a couple of calls right after this\nNothing day rates may apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness and it's easier than ever ageless male Macs a patent pending formula with an ingredient that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases a muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTo your man who to the max by dry your first dirty diaper bottle free shipping and handling not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word fast\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with age will smell ... too intense please decreased use for your free bottle text fast\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text F.
