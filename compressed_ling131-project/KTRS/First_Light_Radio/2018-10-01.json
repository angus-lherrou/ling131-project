now but at its\nMost basic this is not illegal situation is not really a court of law it's a battle for public opinion so how does an investigation fit into this let's ask retired FBI supervisory agent James galley on\nJames\nSo people have said that it is it is not a court of law and they're they're a hundred percent accurate they are but look our laws are predicated on our social mores on our culture on or\nYou know how we how we live as a society [noise] um I Believe as I Know every ... every prosecutor beliefs that people are entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process I understand it this is a job interview it is not you know this is not a criminal case\nI just figure they're going forward you know if something like this if you can make an allegation and eat it cannot be it cannot be substantiated\nWe're going to move into a pretty dark place because nobody remembers that the FBI investigated ills charges back in Nineteen Ninety One they put together a report and the reports that they could not substantiate\nAny of them they interviewed people that are part of education where she and Clarence Thomas work they interviewed people at the equal Employment Opportunity commission we're both work and they could substantiate it it was given to the White House and obviously the proceedings move forward in justice Thomas made it to the court\nBut people still recall those days and say well people just didn't believe or or that she wasn't given you know she\nWasn't taken seriously but no one gets the charges and that's going to be what's going to happen here nothing\nEven if there is nothing comes of this are not able to corroborate substantiate any of it [noise] I fear that you know justice Kevin I was going to be is ... ... in perpetuity whether or not he makes the court that's a political decision and I don't weigh in on those things\nBut I think it is going to be not a good idea going forward if we move into this realm now where the presumption of innocence has taken for granted\nAnd we don't give people due process that's just my opinion is an old season was an FBI agent look at it this now as a as a as just a U.S citizen\nAnd I guess you have that right Andrea also injury appreciate the fact that you are speaking with the voice of experience retired supervisory FBI agent James ... coming up on sixteen before they our and our let's go to the phones and take your calls David I understand you are in Washington DC or the state\nThat's the state well good morning very early morning out there and so what do you think about it yeah it's\nLike but almost three o'clock out here yeah anyway I think that uh this uh uh investigation should go forward the FBI because this is criminal and I noticed that used to have is that your limitations is seven years for a sexual assault\nNo more it's the same as murder there's no statute of limitations at all\nMhm and I and I agree with that total it if they say that and then for the night\nSo you want to go on if they come back in a couple of days and so you know we're we're we're finding some leads now and we'd like another week or two would you granted mad or do we want to just say look you know you had your time\nCut it off but\nThe get go on as long as it has\nTo be All right just laid out mountains or the brass fat that busy\nThey're innocent\nGuilty of this a sexual assault that\nHe's been accused of All right thank you David in Washington for the call quarter before the our morning Jesse you are in the Lone Star state mourning\nMourning bell you're on the answer\nYes or no I just wanted to say this is ridiculous for this woman to be coming up these charges thirty six years ago and just be ticketed\nWhile I think I mean it it it is a long time but you know it seems to be the the generally accepted opinion now by people who study these things legal people people who work in the ... as health professionals mental health professionals\nAnd even most of society now is this coming to grips with the fact that this is how this kind of thing works that it takes for women a long long long time to be able to deal with this and come forward with it\nAnd so we know we may not those of us who have not suffered may not understand it but I think we have to appreciate it\nAnd that's where we are that's the that's the world we are in now and uh for better or worse that's the situation that the FBI has to deal with and you know they're up against it because they've got to track down thirty six year old leads which is which is difficult they do have a bit of a road map now with the calendar and that uh\nThat uh the nominee a judge Kavanaugh turned over so maybe that will give them you have to give them some help Sonia thanks for the call appreciate it let's go up the coast of Massachusetts Good morning Richard\nHello Richard you're on the corner the money yes well I think that the the\nShould continue even as that goes tests the week\nWell I think that the the\nInvestigations continue even as that goes tests a week I think that uh Christine Blasey Ford was incredibly credible and I ended up in the Republicans knowing they absolutely no and that's why they dispensed with the Arab prosecutor about asking question\nOkay we're going back and we're going to go after the Democrats\nWith a meat cleaver and talk about how this is a conspiracy but say she is standing or thirty eight yeah thank you know I mean all of these priests accused ... of the present accused of sexually molesting boys and a lot of cases that's twenty or thirty it at\nAll or even more but didn't end so let's believe them no no that's not the way it works she's a woman and she was a very credible evidence of witness and I but I certainly believe her and I think it absolutely would ... that people say we shouldn't ... you know we should just have the the low and and then put them on the court\nWhen in fact he may be somebody who is certainly somebody who attacked her\nAnd he may have been involved in some of these other cases so I think they absolutely need to do the level best to investigate\nAll right appreciate the call let's go to South Dakota good morning Dave checking in from the heartland Pi Day morning\nI'd say a refrain from college people's idiots\nAnd that kind of stuff but the ALL this whole thing has such a sham a her just loyalists shot falls but everything else that people that claim that are around ... later\nAnd she is saying no I was a list that they are so anyhow I just don't believe I don't believe a lot of ... in the bedroom and yes it takes a long time for some a legal bring it up and\nYou know it's just a situation here where\nThe Democrats are trying to stay out as long as I can because they think overall on a house and Senate\nOkay they have the question of timing is interesting because both both sides are trying to manipulate the clock here the or the ... the Senate Republicans want to get this over when they'd like to start calling procedural votes by the end of the week to advance this nomination and we know\nWhy that is they're trying to present the base voters river a with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court which you know for for the I mean that is a reasonable thing for them to do for people who believe that way that is what are the machinery is there within the government for them to do that\nAnd they're trying to you know a generate some support from the mid term elections to hold onto his many house and Senate seats as they can and\nTo do that they want to get those three Democrats who are in those states uh you know wanting to be quotas and Indiana and also I'm\nA whose average Joe Manchin of West Virginia they want to get them on record voting against this nominee so they can they can hurt them in states where Trump is ... is popular in in those states are you know both sides are trying to manipulate the clock here so I\nUm but you know it's it's interesting also for you though it's not really a matter of the length of time that it took her to come forward you just find her individual story not credible was that what you were saying\nThat is correct then another thing here if ah everybody was so a Bain\nFired at getting women's rights and everything now let's go back to the Clinton area where he was guilty of rape he was guilty\nOf face let nobody did anything about it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "First Light Radio", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "01"}
