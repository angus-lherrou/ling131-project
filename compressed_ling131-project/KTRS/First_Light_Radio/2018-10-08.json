has a home in Maine so she does qualify\n... that's an interesting role you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has a another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for a quite a few years now\nSo you know on television we could see what was happening on the Senate floor things looked fairly normal [noise]\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are our people did I did do they have contact with each other across the aisle do they swap each other on the back of his all that just gone right now\n\nA little of both um this particular vote on a confirmation was unusual in that well in many ways but it was unusual in that the senators all were in the chamber at the same time\nAnd they were voting from their seats so everybody could hear their gays or nays normally they just go up to the recording clerk and ah you know just talk to that person or raise their hand a thumbs up or thumbs down and then they leave the chamber of this was one of those very high profile votes and everybody was required to\nBe there in their desks will stand up for their desks will say how they were going to vote\nUh I did watch a lot of the inter personal communication that was going on of course the Republicans were huddled with the Republicans the Democrats were huddled with the Democrats there was a lot of conversation going on uh but uh you know that not many people talking to his wife Lisa Murkowski a which is interesting body language\nA but it was it was a ward of those rare occasions\nWhere there was a lot of milling about and ah and also just uh\nEverybody in the chamber at the same time you may not know this will you may Michael but a lot of people are saying that the chamber's full when they vote usually or even when they speak from the Senate floor but they actually tend to be speaking to an almost empty chamber\nBecause everybody is monitoring the proceedings from closed circuit or in their offices in the office buildings so uh they\nAll these fiery speeches and such are usually give it just to the recording clerk in the uh the presiding officer\nSure well I guess they expected that there would be a lot of people watching at home on television and plus there was a weekend so there are probably more people available at home to sit down there and just watch this for hours I Know that\nI kept running into people who are who are saying people who would not normally be interested in politics thing or even during the week the week before when when the hearing was on that they were recording it on TV are just to make sure when they got home and be able to watch it intense public interest in this\nIt's Eighteen before they are known for his lied we're talking with our Capitol Hill correspondent Linda ... so what happens next I mean the Congress has not in today's a holiday plus it's a Monday\nSo I mean they don't have any work days left before the election do they\nVery few in fact the house has already off the house to the entire month of October off so they could go back to their home districts and campaign the Senate probably would have done very much the same had it not been for this Kavanaugh fight and uh\nThey still have a few things on their agenda to do and I mean we need to cross the I's dotted the T's if you will on on taxes they're hoping to to bring that up again\nSo then what they want to reverse was another round of tax cuts is that correct\nAnother round of tax cuts that's right that's right and that bodes well for the uh\nFor votes during the elections but you know all spending package is generally we're supposed to begin in the house to house has gone so it's going to be a lot of a place holder legislative items in the Senate agenda\nOr not the least of which will be a number of confirmations as well nothing is high profile as the Supreme Court nominee mind you but still it's a lower jets lower level judgeship slow things of that nature some\nMore a lower level of uh administrative positions federal agency positions there's always those to go through 'em\nSo not a lot of high profile stuff left because keep in mind you know the Senate [noise] a lot of those folks are up for re election and they they really want to get to their home districts as well\nSo when they come back when river ... highest who might be a lame duck session\nWhere they've been take up some things van and I'm Wondering how the election returns mind you know affect that because say the Democrats take the house or maybe even take the Senate which doesn't seem likely but it is a possibility but if they take the house\nAnd do the Republicans at that point try to ram through everything that's on their wish list or do they look at the election returns and say maybe we better mend our ways little bit more in touch or if the Republicans maintain their hold on the house then did they just run everything through and what happens to money for the wall do you think the president in a lame duck session might get the money for his border wall but he wants\nWell they have until December seventh to figure out\nThat issue because that's part of the are continuing resolution on Sunday\nThat was passed up before the house went home for the tarp October and it also it contains some defense money so they do still have to work on that uh they deliberately made sure that the ISI are would go past the mid term so that it wouldn't become an election issue\nSo that is going to have to be dealt with but other than that\nAnd that you know the last of the appropriations which are also in part of that the our uh that's really the only thing that they're going to have to do and they will probably try and brand that through knowing that uh they risk a government shutdown if they don't\nMhm oh government shutdown while that would be interesting if it happens in a lame duck session because what happens if they if they can't get it finished before the before the calendar runs out on them I don't think they want to be there on Christmas Eve Christmas would not be a good time to have a government shutdown one would not think\nWell we've we've been there before on Christmas Eve although as I recall it was for healthcare not shut down but we tend to go very close to the line they shut down\nOr something or think about All right what else is going on before we let you go anything else we should know about as as a as we look to see what Congress does and you know for the next couple of a couple of months before the before the new new Congress comes in and whichever form\nI think it better question would be what Congress doesn't there's a little joke\nUp on Capitol Hill we don't know which is worst Congress being in session of Congress being out of session aren't you know that we're not sure yet what\nIn session of Congress being out of session aren't you know generally we're not sure yet what they're going to do it's mostly going to be a case it past the art and mostly getting ... getting used to the constant campaigning between now and election day and and then afterwards cleaning up the messages that might be left behind\nAll right thanks so much Lynda Kenya on our Capitol Hill corresponded we appreciate very much that you're taking some time out of your sleep to talk with us on first light thank you so much my
