R. S.\nEnjoying it\nIs Wednesday\nWednesday openings\nAnd we are about to do our dream that segment without my classes are too many do you remember from channel five I remember that guy now Mike is director of communications for the visiting nurse association and we've done has shown that they are just we have and so one of the volunteers from visiting nurse association is ...\nAnd that's who we are honoring today so we'll be talking to Mike and Anne Marie and just a couple of minutes here you know once I used when I first started working here I use my GPS to get here yeah 'cause you know I Can't find my\nWay out of the paper bag everywhere so if you use your GPS to find Westport\nPlaza driving you end up in somebody's front yard really suggests if any of you I had it this way could be careful that west part play house into your GPS and you'll find\nOut I found out one time that there there are several places that if you put in the name of a business or if you put in like a category of business and it comes up with a a hardware store there are times where for whatever reason a\nApple maps will take you choose the house of the guy who owns the hardware store you're kidding and you'll end up in the neighborhoods in ways that doesn't look like a hardware store and all show yeah if you ever end up there and you can knock on the guys aren't aren't sure it's illegal under very confused\nAnd ... thank you so much for joining us ... thank you for having me I'm just excited to be here and Michael averages you're also he might\nStand in line [laughter] hey guys how closely funny [laughter] you're always most us on trying to tell us\nAbout your Twenty years of volunteering you volunteer with love on a leash and visiting nurse that says that is\nCorrect time basically on I started listening to leash and that was back in Nineteen Ninety eight I'm In a way that kind of came about I don't know how much time you're listening there is there you have um I basically was training at the main society\nCan was dealings in training and one of the ladies afterwards came up and said have you ever thought of doing therapy\nAnd I was like I Want to introduce ... hair paid a ... to know how to get into it\nSo she invited me to come to their training session and I did a lot of debt and so I started training with slovenly she went through an extensive training program has about twelve weeks we had to get our CDC and do our basic obedience and everything like that\nSo you and Barkley didn't at people who are in ... ... ... what is it like to be with somebody and I've been to hospice with both my parents and my uncle and John did you say you had had the experience you know my grandmother\nUntil you're visiting somebody who it might be the last time correct to sit down and there had been several patients that I have worked with that that was the only\nTime correct to visit them and there had been several patients that I had worked with that that was the only time I met with him was just that one time on my philosophy with doing hospice is that you're in the moment and you just want to create that moment and allow them to either Passover\nOr to have a moment that they can be peaceful with and be able to leave the earth um I've had a lot of experiences where\nThey were asking for permission\nAnd nobody else would give them permission and I just left them in the I live I contact here um and just said go ahead it's okay um I had another situation that I just wanted to share um we had a lady who was at one of my facilities\nAnd she basically said she did not want to pass until she met with my dog\nSo they called me from work because I work full time job and I got my uniform on and I race down to the nursing home and by this point\nShe could not talk she could not function basically but she had that eye contact so we walked job with Barclay and basically I said it's OK you can go now and she padded darkly and and they said two hours later she had just\nSo interesting I don't know if this was your experience John but the hospice nurse has told us that to to let your loved one no it's okay to go and I had a hospice nurse telling me that most people choose when they when they die at when they're really hospice and that's why so many families like in hospitals do to have a meal they come back and their parents are gone\nAnd one of the individuals who was called to for that meeting was our next guest his name is Dr Douglas genteel he's a professor of psychology at Iowa State and Doug thanks for taking the time to join us here on the big five fifty Katie are is\nWell it's my pleasure although I should clarify that I was uninvited honored by that meeting a which I guess suggest that the media industry I think I'm too dangerous to\nGo I'm Sorry I got I got well but you're one\nOf those who feels that that video games can certainly add too aggressive behavior amongst our young as ... are you is that in my\n... I think the way you're praising it is really very important to their\nTalking or there's a difference between say aggressive behavior\nAnd violence yes as a lesson\nImportant difference aggression is much broader aggression can be a physical can be verbal it can be relational where you're like me reuse your relationship to harm someone like giving them the cold shoulder or it\nWhereas violence is physical only ended up here it's really extreme such that if successful the cause severe bodily damage our debt\nSo it's a really narrow and extreme some type of aggression and there is a lot of research on not just video games with other media TV and movies going back to the Nineteen sixties that does shows that are kids who are a lot of media violence\nTo become more willing to behave aggressively when provoked then that's a really different thing from saying cause the school shootings were checked off in the way it is a this gets their own misinterpreted or in the public domain\nBut if they are more aggressive as a result of their exposure to these games and they tend to be\nAnd or\nYou could your correct me if I'm mis categorized that but what we might call troublemakers or problems or or have issues a debt aggressiveness could be act it out in and sometimes violent behavior or at least\nA you know ... if nothing else to get they get in fights or something like that for\nSure and\nI think the you know the thing to remember is often when there's been a terrible tragedy\nUh like like before the shooting\nWe we often asked the wrong question what are you asking what ... what was the cause of this and the minute we asked a question we're already are kept wrong tree because there's never a single cause for most human behaviors especially not want as complicated\nAs aggression because we're we're more complicated than that we don't do things just for one and the the the U.S surgeon general's report on youth violence actually documents about a hundred scientifically known risk factors for aggression\nMedia violence is just one of them it's and it's not the biggest uh it's right in the middle it's kind of about the same size is coming from a broken home and we all know people who came from broken homes would never do anything seriously aggressive\nBut that's different from saying it had no effect it still was a risk for them [laughter] morally\nYou know consuming allowed me to violence playing a lot about video games or most people never do anything seriously aggressor which is still a different thing from saying it's having no a factor in fact if you ask a violent game or why they like to play it\nI'll tell you they like the adrenalin rush right when they're exactly right it is a ... on the gentleman or adrenaline cortisone testosterone\nShrank when they're exactly right it is a drag on the gentleman or adrenaline cortisone testosterone these are the so called stress hormones those are the same cocktail hormones\nThat you would drop into your blood stream if I punched you right now which is really interesting you know it's just a game but your body is treating it like a real fight that fear factor it's actually preparing you for aggression\nAnd gamers like that feeling a which is fair because normally when you've got that cocktail for most of your bloodstream not enjoying what's going on [laughter]\nWell and and there's also a certain people are in the population that could be addicted to that kind of adrenalin rush in need that kind of adrenalin rush act\nYeah certainly we do start to\nForm a habit for what amount of stimulation we crave I think that's a different thing from the aggression aspect though let me give you an example of a study we did with three thousand kids\nWhich followed them some registering them once a year for three years basically and we find that the kids who\nWere playing the most video a video game this year was the second year the way they had to learn to think and see the world to chase so we measure three different ways to this\nOne is called hostile attribution by the technical term what it means is we all know people\nWho when something annoying happened is they can just uh they assume the best and they let it roll off their backs and we also know people who take it very personally this is more like a second way\nThat you have a bias for attributing hostility towards other people's actions when something annoying habit do you think they meant to do it they meant to make you mad and of course the whole time you're playing around video gave you a practicing this cause you're constantly hyper vigilant for things coming out and being not\nAttacking you [noise] the second thing we measure is what's called normative beliefs about Russian which is how acceptable you think it is to behave aggressively wedding provoked and again we all know people who say you should always turn the other cheek and we know other people say you know you should hit back harder\nThis again is more like that second one\nAnd in a violent video game you're getting reinforced are being told it's good to respond aggressively one provoked the third is aggressive fantasies how much time you spend thinking about how you would like to hurt other people and of course the whole time you're playing violent video game you're practicing that [noise]\nAnd so we found that these three types of aggressive cognition is change based on their playing games and an ... year later than they were more physically aggressive\nSo imagine what that kid looks like in the real world he's at school he gets bumped into hallway\nHe stops assuming it was an actor he starts assuming that person meant to do that he quickly reorient his attention\nTo the person because you practice at in the game to any calls to mind a response to what you do well usually the thing that humans do especially under stress the thing that they practice the most and of course none of our game of practice aggressive responding thousands and thousands of times and because you've been reinforced toward you think that that's an acceptable response\nAnd so you can see how the odds\nHave changed in that way that now that kid is more likely to push back or say something on kind and if he does then of course the sky rocket for turning into a full fledged aggressive and counter but if it does happen what what that looks like in the hallway looks nothing like what they were practicing game show some kids are not copying\nIt changes the way you think is perceived in the world and you carry that with you everywhere it his colors everything ... slightly shifts the odd\nAlmost paranoid almost paranoia [noise] it can be yeah yeah and so I mean the bottom line is it that if you're if if you have a a stable well adjusted child in a good home and you're a nurturing parent\nOr the fact that the kid locked himself in his room for a couple of hours a day and the I'm sure you're an advocate of marshalling\nOur kids exposure to technology and and having time limits and things like that I'm just going to assume that hum interact and uh but they're ... sitting down in front of even violent game or is not necessary is not in itself is\nGoing to turn them into a killer that are more violence however he could certainly agitated or accelerate that kind of behavior if there were other problems president already\nYeah it it is one risk factor but all those other things you mentioned are protective factors and it's always this constant you know some things are heating it up some things are cooling down\nWrite well again we need to be good parents and that's that's first and foremost and a lot of that responsibility lies with us\nThank you so much for taking time to talk with us today interesting conversation that could easily go on for another hour on this I was a two time my pleasure already have a great weekend that is she dug genteel he is a doctor Doug Douglas genteel the professor of psychology at\nIowa State talking about video games and violence and whether or not there is any correlation interesting conversation\nYou're listening
