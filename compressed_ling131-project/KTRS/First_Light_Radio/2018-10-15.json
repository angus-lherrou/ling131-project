and you will to starting Wednesday so ticket holders you have some good news there in Chicago and that's first light for this half hour program produced by David Jose oh along with audio engineer Joe art and jerk I'm Michael Toscano says the production of westward one news\nIncluding people who like to watch football games without politics so it's you know what your body fat and appropriate forum bats in the eye of the beholder I Believe that to you to decide but that is those are the issues that we are talking about this morning\nAnd it was sort of brought to our attention because there's a case in Texas where students has refused to recite the pledge of allegiance to state has cracked down on it saying it's the law\nAnd so now there's a lawsuit challenging the right of Texas law to mandate\nThat you have to say the pledge of allegiance and a public school\nClinton novel has some background on us around\nThat Michaels in Texas it's up to parents whether or not their child to recite the pledge by state law parent or guardian can sign a waiver to let their child opt out of it but the student didn't still can't\nSchoolchildren cannot unilaterally refused to participate in the pledge mark\nRight lander what the Texas attorney general's office says the law gives parents or guardians of fundamental interest in getting the education and upbringing of their kids\nTexas is among twenty six states with similar statute that make reciting the pledge of allegiance a regular part of every school day furthermore sixteen other states have statutes do allow for a time to be set aside for students who wish to say the pledge of allegiance on their own\nKids he Landry sued the Houston area district after she says a principal kicked her daughter out of school for sitting during the pledge of allegiance she says the law violates their free speech right according to write lander the cases about respecting the country and the parental rights\nRequiring the pledge to be re sided at the start of every school day has the laudable result of fostering respect for our flag and a patriotic love for our country\nThis case is about providing for this thing of the pledge of allegiance while respecting the parental rights to direct the education of children\nThe cage to separate trial next year\nMichael All right thanks that's Clayton novel reporting on this case in Dallas and as I mentioned earlier there are some folks who are trying to fight all are trying to find alternate methods of\nExpressing some appreciation for our country by not using the pledge of allegiance in San Francisco's Unified School district the last week well if they had a change they have a brand new president of the school district his name is Stefan cook\nAnd meetings that always open with the pledge of allegiance but he opted instead for reading that he says expresses a love of country\nWhen you learn teach when you get give credits that to a poet Maya Angelou who uh did go to um high school in ah in San Francisco and uh this guy cook says this is not a demonstration and the same way that um the some of the NFL players\nAre kneeling during the national anthem they're talking about police brutality he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nAnd uh so he said it had nothing to do with President Trump or anything like that but of course it gets controversy because some people do not like you messing around with the pledge of allegiance a there's a there's a schoolteacher in Indianapolis [noise]\nAh I have that information here and ah his name is John ... he teaches history in Indianapolis and\nHe says that what he's done is to kind of spruce up um the the flag every day he'd get somebody different from the community to come into the school to lead us to believe the students there in the in the pledge of allegiance or they're doing the pledge but they're finding a way to make it interesting so that you don't just do it by memory or by rote or because you're told to do it\nBy having somebody different ... leading it he says it makes it a something that you pay more attention to and maybe by paying more attention to what you think more about it so he's got a different approach to reviving our pledge of allegiance\nNow the thing is can you can you mandate allegiance doesn't allegiance have to be earned kind of like respect their you know we we just heard the attorney general from Texas saying he believes respect is learned by making somebody recite the pledge what do you think about that cause eight hundred seven three six three six six six when we come back in two minutes\nWe'll hear what you have to think this is first light\n[noise]\n\n\nFrom a massive cactus falling on a home here
