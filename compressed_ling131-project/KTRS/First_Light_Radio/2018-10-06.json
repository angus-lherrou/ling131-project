McKay who directed then wrote a whole helpful wrote and directed those movies also\nTo the screenplay and directed the big short hearing that press tour I'm guessing he was relentlessly us all to do with that question as everybody is and um he finally said yes but it's going to take ten years because it was ten years between the first and second one\nAnd so he thought that it should be ten years between the second and third I wait there you go\nLast year there is a film called priceless to her which neither David kept there were used distinct right pretty serious film about human trafficking uh\nAnd having kids and kids often most affected by this having five kids of your own and doing this [noise] was that we're here are you able to separate is I'm just doing a movie this is just a scenario in the plot of a film like oh my God this could happen to my job\nThat can happen and that's partly why did it be because you know you want to bring awareness that human trafficking is a huge problem in every major city gets it happens here this is a hub St Louis is a hobby yeah because it makes yeah horrible perfect sense because you're centrally located\nAnd uh just government might you know your city might not have the resources to go after those types of crimes and they are a lot of the times on the right aren't a lot of people are under this conception that ah these young ladies consent\nTo those type of work for most of the time certainly when they're younger they are absolutely not they're just brought in and and slaves in the human trafficking business [noise]\nSo yeah and I start working with an organization called children the night and they got rescue girls from the ages of ... new to Seventeen I Know does that that hurts so bad and a lot of these girls is kidnapped

the movie still available priceless I'm sure you can download it you know and when you do something with such a heavy theme\nWhen the body of your work is largely comedy and the way you're obviously wired is it difficult to pull that part of David sprain out of the picture when you're trying to do something so dramatic\nBoy you work a little harder 'cause it's a different muscle that's for sure in terms of you know you're not trying to land a joke right you're trying to end the performance so it takes more investigation on your part\nYou know cause you will hear people say well comedy's 'cause you know dying is easy comedy's hard right but for people that are naturally humorists and it's not as hard as you would think it'd be dramatic I Would think would be an even bigger challenge\n... yeah it can be in a case by case we've all seen people that have tried to make that transition and to varying degrees of success why'd you look at me when you said I thought you in our independent\nBut you have to tell you when you said people are trying to figure out what the heck are you trying to be funny trying to have a soul yet his eyebrows you can't see and under the cowboy

apartment building just the guy actually rate\nWhile that's pretty cool so a lot of connect the dots there I Can't think of the name of the book but if you want a big fan that might be an interesting rate for yeah then parents will she wrote a novel\nYes that's an interesting in and out of the south I can barely say his last day yeah why it's probably a lot of pictures of ... just yes that's really the way to go it's just like one sentence per page\nWe had um their home on the show nice and uh he was chatting with Carney said that was funny naturally\nI live in no way and I am in tone as your articulation have accused\nYou of not being for the I think are being paranoid Lou that\nEra hall says in the eighties he would hang out with people in New York but like Lou Reed and Patti Smith and all that and they would all ask each other what they were doing oh what are you working on Lou I'm Patty what do you work in a nobody as Daryl\nWhen he was working it was that what they said that
