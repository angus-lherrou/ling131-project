morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this\nAre you willing to trash a treaty and return to the old arms race of the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons are building weapons that hopefully we would never be able to or have to use or would you rather save that money for domestic needs build some new bridges in airports and trains and infrastructure\nAnd electrical grid which is your priority call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six so now Fred ... has been following this infrared is based in Moscow for us and he brings us up to date on what it was just being said on both sides of the Atlantic on this issue [noise]\nOr the U.S Russia had it for you the real harm free Moscow said it could happen to President Trump announced over the weekend the U.S will exit the INS treaty\nAgreement\nBecause they violated the agreement on terminating\nFrosty welcome for national security adviser John Bolton in Moscow Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov demanding an explanation and warning Russia will retaliate\n... any action in

and they failed Gorbachev led to the withdrawal of twenty seven hundred from your [noise] the\nUs says Russia has been violating the deal deploying new medium range of nuclear capable missile flows NATO territory\nMaybe this is just to move to say look if if we don't if you don't strike not we're moving out of this and I hope that's the case I Hope we're going to be able to figure out a way to stay within the trading\nMoscow denies it's reaching the ins and it turns lame America for violating it by developing missile defense technology\nWe still don't get to target missiles used in the U.S to test the defense systems are identical to intermediate range ballistic missiles surely they exist as they are in use which doesn't mean their production in the U.S could be a sign that ins prohibited technologies are in development\n[noise] several of America's allies say they're concerned about the Trump Administration\nTend to be hearing after decades of calm [noise]\nClear weapons surge once again a lot of\nConcern about America's allies in Europe other places as well of course a lot of anger here in Moscow and the tough meetings continue for the national security adviser John Bolton he is meeting none other than Vladimir Putin himself today the Kremlin has already said who also wants them to ... explain what the us plans to do how the U.S plans to move forward\nAll right thanks to front plight can reporting from Moscow for first flight this morning we are at Eighteen minutes before the hour on first live give us a call at eight hundred seven three six six six six and you know this is not just the story between the United states and China\nI mean the United states and Russia China is also involved in this because uh right now U.S officials are the U.S has been relying on other capabilities to balance China and places like the south China Sea they're using missiles fired from ships or aircraft\nAnd are advocates for us land based missile response which would be a prohibited by this say that's the best way to deter China and their use of their land based missile forces experts are warning that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse any requests from the U.S to position their missiles there China kind of like this whole thing because they say hey\nYou know this this will allow us to to do a bunch of things and we're going to stop you from basing basing missiles in this part of the world and that would give them an advantage\nWe also hear from a Soviet the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning he's the one who signed the deal with President Reagan he says that President Trump is being a very very irresponsible and he fears a new nuclear arms race\nSo let's take you back now to December eighth Nineteen eighty seven president Ronald Reagan is in the East Room of the White House standing next to Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev and getting ready to sign the treaty\nWas over six years ago November Eighteen Nineteen eighty one by first proposed what would come to be called at zero options\nThere was a simple proposal one might say disarming really simple [noise]\nUnlike treaties in the past it didn't simply codified the status quo or a news arms field they didn't simply talk of controlling an arms race for the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction\nIn this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nAnd that brings us to today and by the way that the that treaty\nEliminated thousands of land based missiles or with a range of between approximately three hundred and thirty four hundred miles so that's a pretty big wide swath of a nuclear arsenal and as I said that brings us to today President Trump threatening to withdraw from the treaty would you like to see that happening are you concerned that that will\nTip the balance of power in the world will that will eat up all the money that we need to rebuild our own country our infrastructure our bridges are trains our electrical grid our Internet grid\nYou know our roads we need to be a building things to help us deal with hurricanes we need to rebuild whole cities along the coast there are a lot of things to put money into do you want to put money into building nuclear weapons that\nProbably will never be using if they
