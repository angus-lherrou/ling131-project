House in our president he recently held a a roundtable discussion\nIn the wake of the Florida shooting regarding\nA video games of violent video games and what impact if any\nThey may be having on our youth and uh their behavior and one of the individuals who was called to for that meeting was our next guest his name is Dr Douglas genteel use a professor of psychology at Iowa State and Doug thanks for taking the time to join us here on the big five fifty K. tier us\nOh it's my pleasure although I should clarify that I was invited to your audience about that meeting a which I guess that the media industry you think are too dangerous\nTo go no I'm Sorry I got I got well but you're one of\nThose who feels that that video games can certainly add too aggressive behavior amongst our young as ... or you says that in my\nYes you're on like the way you're raising it is really very important\nTalking or there's a difference between the aggressive behavior and\nViolence and all that\nImportant difference aggression is much broader aggression can be physical can be verbal can be relational where you're like Mary use your relationship to arms from like giving them the cold shoulder [noise] ah [noise] ah whereas violence is physical only\nAdded here it's really extreme such that if successful would cause a beer bottle we ...\nSo it's a really narrow and extreme some type of aggression and there is a lot of research on not just video games with other media\nAggression and there is a lot of research on not just video games with other media TV and movies going back into the Nineteen sixties that does shows that are kids who watch a lot of media violence\nDo become more willing to behave aggressively when provoked and that's a really different thing from saying causes school shootings Jay off in the way it is a this gets your own misinterpreted ah in in the public domain\nBut if they are more aggressive as a result of their exposure to these games are and they tend to be\nConfrontational and or you ... your correct me if I miss categorize it but what we might call troublemakers\nOr problems or or have issues a debt aggressiveness can be act it out in in sometimes violent behavior or at least a you know ... if nothing else they get they get in fights or something like that for\nSure and ah [noise] I think the other thing to remember is often when there's been a terrible tragedy\nUh like like the Florida shooting\nWe we often asked the wrong question we ask what what was the cause of this and the minute we asked a question we're already bar after wrong tree because there's never a single cause for most human behaviors especially not one is complicated\nAs aggression because we're we're more complicated than that we don't do things just for one reason or and the you know the U.S surgeon general's report on youth violence actually documents about a hundred scientifically known risk factors for aggression\nMedia violence is just one of them it's and it's not the biggest uh it's right in the middle it's kind of about the same size as coming from a broken home and we all know people who came from broken homes would never do anything seriously aggressive\nBut that's different from saying it had no effect it's still one was a risk for them [laughter] animal early\nYou know consuming a lot of meat or violence or playing a lot of video games or most people I Would never do anything seriously aggressively which is still a different thing from saying it's having no effect in fact if you ask of our own game or why they like to play it\nThey'll tell you they like the adrenalin rush right and they are exactly right it is a drag on the gentleman and or adrenaline and quarters on testosterone these are the so called stress hormones those are the same cocktail hormones that you would drop into your bloodstream if I punched you right now\nWhich is really interesting you know it's just a game but your body is treating it like a real fight that's the effect it's actually preparing you for aggression [laughter] and [laughter] and gamers like that feeling a ... which is fair because normally when you've got that cocktail for most of your bloodstream you're not enjoying what's going on [laughter]\nWell and there's also a certain people are in the population that it could be addicted to that kind of adrenalin rush in need that kind of adrenalin rush act\nYeah and certainly we do start to form a habit for what amount of stimulation we crave I think that's a different thing from the aggression aspect though let me give you an example of a study we did with three thousand kids we\nFollowed them some measuring them once a year for three years basically and we find that the kids who were playing the most violent video games you're on a second year the way they had to learn to this thing can see the world has changed so we measured three different ways of this\nOne is called hostile attribution biased the technical term what it means as we all know people\nWho are when something annoying happened is they can just you know they assume the best and they let it roll off their backs and we also know people who take it very personally this is more like that second way\nThat you have a bias for attributing hostility towards other people's actions when something annoying habits do you think they meant to do it they meant to make you mad [noise] um and of course the whole time you're playing violent video gave you a practicing this cause you're constantly hyper vigilant for things coming out and being not\nAttacking you [noise] the second thing we measured is what's called normative beliefs about aggression which is how acceptable you think it is to behave aggressively wedding provoked and again we all know people who think you should always turn the other cheek and we know other people say you know you should get back harder or this again is more like that second one\nAnd in a violent video game you're getting reinforced being told it's good to respond a aggressively one provoked and then the third is aggressive fantasies how much time you spend there was thinking about how you would like to hurt other people and of course the whole time you're playing violent video game you're practicing that [noise]\nAnd so we found that these three types of aggressive cognition is change based on their playing games and and then never year later than they were more physically aggressive\nSo imagine what that kid looks like in the real world he's at school he gets bumped in the hallway he stops assuming it was an accident he starts assuming the person meant to do that he quickly reorient his attention to the person 'cause you practice that in the game to end your call to mind a response to what you do\nWell usually uh thing humans do especially under stress as the thing that they've practiced the most and of course none of the game was practiced aggressive responding thousands and thousands of times and because you've been reinforced for you think that that's an acceptable response\nIs or you can see how the odds\nHave changed in that hallway that now that kid is more likely to push back or say something unkind and if he does then of course the odd skyrocket for turning into a full fledged aggressive and counter but if it does happen what what that looks like in the hallway looks nothing like what they were practicing games so kids are not copying\nIt changes the way you think and perceive the world and you carry that with you everywhere it if colors everything and ... slightly shift the odd\nAlmost paranoid almost paranoia it can be\nYeah yeah and so I mean the bottom line is it that if you're if you have a a stable well adjusted child in a good home and your nurturing parent\nOr the fact that the kid locked himself in his room for a couple of hours a day and I'm sure you're an advocate of marshalling\nYou're the data for asking for resale on your water you know you\nDo then don't cats no no no you you should always tip people even people that are having a bad day or going through a divorce or whatever they deserve to earn a living however\nHowever what I Would do I would never hesitate to call the manager over and let them know I Would tell them and let the manager make a decision on where he takes it\nFrom there than making a living now if you bring their same sale and then\nListen what what is better for an establishment you to bring the Boston do is to say you know what I'm not getting the service uh for you know remember\nYou service isn't just about what they bring you or your setting food in front of you see all the food is the field in the atmosphere it's everything if I'm a manager and one of my employees is being less than cooperative in their job I Want to know about it\nAnd whether that's a threat to their livelihood or not\nThat's important to me as a business owner because I'm not going to have your business in the future but I'll have a lousy employ staying here because nobody said anything to the phones here a big ... wants to talk about tipping was a big grew\nMan I found out I have a fresh in church and I've always just feel like the Trade Center for what I found out how much a lot of waitresses make\nIs illegal just shouldn't just really like it is illegal but restaurant somehow get away with it and ever since then I've been like crazy or because it's ridiculous how much restaurant food they can get away with their record because the tips\nYeah it's a it's a low wage but they're allowed to do it it's one of those industries where it's a lot to do it because the tip is supposed to\nOr even out or the you know the wage ... state but sometimes\nLike restaurants go below what what the government I mean it's\nCorrect and it didn't have to wait in line wage for them because you know\nWell I think that there are allowed to do that by law it's not a reportable incident when your own own a restaurant however\nUh you know one of the things I Would say is you know if you're good at your craft and this is what I always tell my kids you know if you're going I don't care what you do in your life just be the best at absolute okay so if you're good at your craft or you can afford to tell the guy I'm not working for this kind of way and find find another gig but\nI Do appreciate what you're saying and uh you know more people felt like you\nI think the industry would be better for all of us to be honest with you so next time you get good service make sure that you are you know let them know [laughter] so I like to does on a regular basis thanks ... you're listening to show your okay a Chuck out in Chesterfield\n[noise] uh yes I think they get tips but Congress that's ridiculous the farmer over ... or ... out on that song you know that condition director of course\n[laughter] yeah that's a transportation to get for their first that the larger and you get ... percent are bringing up with first degree that everybody trapped in this time like check on that's on sale\nOr I have to uh you know I have to think about what you just said ... I\nYou know it's a different thing when you're getting less than minimum wage and and I don't know your farmers who writes farmers got a tough job they bring sustenance to us they bring nutrition too was a ... ... it's American staple the farmer but um\nI you know I don't know what a farmer makes in a year I don't know the you know I Know they put in a lot of labor that's for sure but um [noise]\nUh I'd have to be reserved and comment on that one Chuck but I appreciate your calling in\nOkay thank you and thanks so much a couldn't catch the name on line three by a very good and get your name what what's your name [noise]\nNameless [noise]\n[laughter] yes I Am [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter] that's all right [noise] [laughter] until ten below\nThe co director of that [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter] I don't know [laughter] and then an audio because more [noise]\nI understand we're changing yes right I'm\nDoing [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter] I Know I'm In the world\nI appreciate your call thank you for the uh for checking in thanks for listening to the show\nOkay\nTake care of you sent a trench to me and I think you're right because the French I Believe it was right\nAll right I was like the international flare on the way we got a lot of people call in and we get out and we get built Tom Carol ah let's see we have a lot going on All right so a hangout guys if you want to make a comment I never even finish the whole thing on millennials but by the way I'm just going to say the other two things with millennials so if you're a memorial\nOr you know somebody that's a millennial a first of all the millennials are on track to have worse health\nIn middle age than their parents for the first time\nIn life great generation after generation is always had better health greatness millennials you're on track to abortion\nPills I don't know if that's the fast food thing I don't know if it's the obesity whatever it is I don't know it's a track and stress bananas especially lonely millennials twice the risk of developing mental health issues and the lonely\nSpecially lonely millennials twice the risk of developing mental health issues and the lonely I Know how are you\nReally so maybe that that doesn't mean that ... okay All right\nAt the holiday season approaches smart celebrating giving\nEach year thousands of individual community racially value of their time and hundreds more make a commitment to get a nearly an incline getting to support its part mission\nWhen our children in ... school providing money together the ongoing time talent treasure made money ordinarily fighting here we are very great memory Ninety thousand local launched\nA ... man my share your dinner and\nMake it possible for the kids who are on the road trying to make we live very differently needed wholesome wiping it right away get there in in three thousand classroom in one hundred sixty one all in high poverty in St Louis area neighborhood to buy their consumable that ... year round\nConsidered like a new year and getting land you can go online to find out more\nOil than slashing\nYeah how are they even approaches kids smart celebrating giving\nEach year thousands of community racially volunteer their time and energy hundreds more make a commitment to get annual A.
