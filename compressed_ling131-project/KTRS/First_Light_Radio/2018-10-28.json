and cloning is why you have Granny Smith apples and Fuji apples and a naval oranges you have a uniform crops tube is watermelon yeah that you can expect season after season that are exactly the same\nWho buys the seated grapes anymore\nI mean who wants to deal with that\nYet [laughter] you can buy them or they're out it's a matter of taste if you're making wind sometimes the seed provides a
