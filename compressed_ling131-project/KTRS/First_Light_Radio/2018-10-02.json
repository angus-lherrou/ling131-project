like that and picket fences were out there and they were overtly falling to the left of center\nIt was bringing that back I thought that that the the topic wasn't as\nRough as just getting the gang back together I thought the the acting in the delivery was a little bit stilted and I think part of that might just be that these people weren't on camera together for almost Twenty years Candice Bergen she was in a movie earlier this year\nAnd while she still has a little bit of good delivery she's a little rough around the edges and you see that with a lot of the the returning shows I think he saw that a bit with Roseanne I think you saw that a fit not nearly as much with will and grace\nUm in the last man standing of course has just gone for about a year or so so that the everyone's kind of back in the game there but Murphy Brown was it was an okay start but it was also really clunky trying to get the premise out\nThere as well there's a lot of interest in seeing something that even if you weren't a regular watcher you probably we're familiar with it from when it was first on the air it was so ubiquitous and it's like well let me just see what they look like and what the sat
