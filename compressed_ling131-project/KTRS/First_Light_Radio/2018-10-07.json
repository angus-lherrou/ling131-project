the show my first question whenever I talk\nTo somebody who's written about something iconic is\nIt has to be daunting Casablanca is not only a famous so mobile loves film but everybody thinks they knew everything about it everybody's seen it multiple times when you sat down at your word processor and maybe your old typewriter I said I'm going to write the definitive book about this what were the major hurdles you had to overcome\nThat great question and I love to use the terms word processor Remington typewriter that\nAre very fondly about their right mind on a on a on a Mac book pro\nMany years writing both on the Remington as well as on a word processor and when it got down to write this book I knew there would be specific hurdles but they did not prove is daunting as one might expect um [noise]\nIt seems like it was time for a rethinking of this most of it of a Hollywood movies and um especially with the Seventy fifth anniversary you know on the horizon when I sat down and began to write the book and Ernest [noise]\nUm it was always thought not only by me but I just actually by the publisher I W W stunning company that this was going to be a book to appear you know to coincide with that that a quarter of a century anniversary and so um\nYou know what I did is I interviewed a few dozen people I combed over the archives I was out at one of us are kind of at you at the\nTime the market Eric library which is the library of the Academy of motion picture arts and sciences here in New York at the New York public as well as library performing arts\nI'm In a number of research Institute too including the ... center up in Harlem especially to work on duty Wilson\nAs well as the legal Beck Institute which is a German Jewish\nCulture listen to the part of the center for Jewish history here in New York City and then all of these places there were in fact uh materials that that hasn't been stumbled upon so there are a good handful or so of of of new finding in in the book but I knew at the outset that that was really not going to be like the main objective you're absolutely right so many people have\nWritten about thought about this book for well for Seventy five years and in Nineteen Ninety to the New York times entertainment writer and writer of the number of uh\nOf obituaries and reports from Hollywood algae and harm it should written her round up the usual suspects production history of the town so that was Ninety two and that book is absolutely indispensable I had the great fortune not only of interviewing out in the book\nBut around Thanksgiving if if you're just as the Seventy fifth anniversary was\nRepeating itself over the horizon I'm we spent several days together I guess that the U.S embassy in Morocco and we interest why screening of the film and cut the block I said we've got to block in America\nAnd it was an extraordinary pleasure talking with her and then fielding questions from Moroccan students with algae and harm it but that's the book that she wrote a terrific book and I try to recreate some of her steps but then it's actually it's we work our way towards the center of that book and and onward\nTo me it's it's also about accounting for what what what what has happened with ah that that that that that glorious film in our cultural imagination and a quarter of a century and she wrote that book\nI think that's the main reason why I Would recommend your book will always have to because her book rounded up the usual suspects is fantastic I read that it's a great production history of how the film came to a beach your book though is how we received this bill not only at the time but of course in the years since there's\nMany classic films have complicated histories with their audience is everything from gone with the wind to the\nUm [noise] that's the ... the publishers are the publisher which book appeared\nWhich which book appeared and she uh in that book destination caught it cuts or by which the wartime history of the actual city it turns out that there was something that came in to these letters and they ... they they basically what they were they were actually he says that were given a stamp and they were given a stamp\nFrom a a marshal they go\nFrom the V. she ... she authority right and in the film this is what's what's what puzzling as puzzled puzzled the\nViewers for well Seventy five years he said in in Peter lower eighties Viennese live in that inevitable accent of his ... he says sounds as if he's saying that they're signed by general\n... Charles Shaw they go what you can do is they gone so he's actually say\nThat when\nIt gets forever people have misunderstood his accent to be saying that ... that the leader of the free ... at that time was exiled in in the u._k. act out in London um\nThey'd be signed by by by by a child to go where they can be signed by Charles to go to the absolutely worthless to me because he was he was a persona non grata yeah absolutely no authority or under under the sheet here that's why he fled to lead the you know the the free French guide to the French from afar\nUm and so that has puzzled viewers and that's been seen as soon as you kind of seem to be going that direction yourself\nAs as one of those things that is completely out of sync with with history you know that really requires this total suspect just leave it turns out there is actually a grain of truth there and I only discovered that when I interviewed narrative simply spoke for the New Republic a several months ago and and when reading it I thought oh my God\n[laughter] 'cause\nI like you I thought oh this is just something that you know what a great Hollywood can faction that they are just with this up because this would be a great ... device\nSeventy five years I knew that you go you have your mom and I feel about the life of its own there's something about it is you need a need that was there before the new film filled you know what you need\nA cap the two great click and that's that's the that's the graph for the book um\nYou know I I think I Would I Would I Would\nPut a fine a point of that to just say just say that it it's it's not just that needed it fills his his Bergman suggest it needs over time that that it's not a single need it's not it's not a sort of one size fits all need at the time I think that need was for especially with America's a link to entry into the war some would say but late entry into the war\nUm is it up Americans needed to be some and you can follow the character arc of Rick Blaine\nThey needed to see these move from isolationism and there was such a such a strong current of isolationism up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor\nStrong current of isolation isn't it yeah that was really rapid in America and and and it's very very vocal isolationist action in Congress [noise]\nUm but to see them move toward principled engagement with the war effort and and and with the allied cars and I think that that was one of the early needs um and that need to in terms of love story to subordinate your own personal or know interests\nFor the greater good of humanity um that's certainly one of of of of the need to I think that that that need or those needs to have evolved over time um there's something almost kind of a\nI don't know poking about those needs I mean I think that they they develop with each with each generation and the Nineteen sixties when people would flock to these repertory screening of the film whether it's at the battle theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts or your film society at Washington University in St Louis or it's half or University in Palo Alto California\nThen I think audiences and this was you know these are people\nWho are becoming involved the student movement of people at least becoming kind of awakened politically that need me it's been somewhat different\nUm you know this is when the the Vietnam War was raging and and and seeing a film that would have spoken to one's parents this and suddenly he has a different maybe strikes a different residents there are a has a different register for for for audiences and today I mean look I I I think I I I one thing that I Need\nTo emphasize here especially the way in which the book has been received over the past uh twelve months or so I'm entered into the world in the age of Trump and and and in in in a moment when when refugee and minorities\nWere continually being\nBack there were being demonized for being\nUm rhetorically at least persecuted and and and so is it the movie it resonates for audiences in and perhaps are different register now than it did then\nI'm even to vent to people who are becoming increasingly aware of the refugee predicament in Europe and and and those who were seeking to escape\nA hits Hitler and go to Europe Nazi and go to Europe um and so maybe they need is is it can't be spoken up and to think of it but I I I think of it as being a series of different needs at different times and then finally had much more kind of\nPutting all their ... or whatever and knock you as a a level um the film I think fulfills a need\nFor moviegoers that need to to be completely ... or at least and chanted by the magic of this extraordinary story these are excluded performances\nA terrific direction production values and so forth and I think that that kind of cuts to the heart of what ... says you know at this point in time and it was actually in the neck eighties when he wrote this in in ... Italy but that that ... ... is not really ... merely one movie it it's the\nAnd the kind of place holder\nIt really was merely one movie the movies and\nThe kind of place holder to cut the block has become you know whether it's in my mid ... century women pointed at getting it plain that the mother figure in that voice over the very beginning when she gets to a movie to you know what I Do think that the movie that would be the poster of got the blind\nIn movies and in la la la la land as well\nYou know any of the law that led to block a movies and the fact that they do work a lot of Warner Brothers you have that window out of which we can do that one appeared looming across the street from that you know that that ... we wish you were to the ...\nOn the one is a lot that significant every day for for us in the twenty first century should tell us they caught the block a suddenly movies as compared to that goes against it\nWell I Love the twentieth century woman I also love low land and of course everybody loves the cats of Lincoln you'd like to read more about Rick Blaine as America itself you read the book will always have just a blanket the life legend an afterlife of Hollywood must love movies no\nEisenberg thank you so much for joining me on the show today we could've killed an hour I'm sure the book is wonderful and I hope everybody goes out there and pick up a copy\nThank you so much max I really appreciate your time is a lot of fun chatting with you and take good care\nThere's much to an interview with new eyes burn the author of will always have a chance of winning which is no real boy in paperback form find it at all the usual suspects\nBig huge interests you so much for listening to max on movies ... told me on Twitter at national movies you are listening to the best of T.
