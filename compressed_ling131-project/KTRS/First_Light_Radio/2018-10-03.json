is it a good idea to do this or should we be um be happy that the company is doing that is this part of some plot somewhere a lot of people are always suspicious you know because Amazon\nIs increasingly investing and automation so in the long run and by the way they say this will cost them about a billion dollars a year\nOr you know that's a lot of money but uh you know they make a lot of money so they can afford that they can either pass on prices to consumers or as time goes on and they do more and more automation I think it's inevitable they will actually have fewer employees on the line and in their warehouses and I believe that's where most of the employees at a\nAt Amazon worked they work in the shipping development as shipping area and they're in warehouses and shipping and that's where a lot of those jobs are not like a places like Walmart where people are working in stores and dealing with customers and that sort of sort of thing this will also put pressure on Walmart which of course is the biggest competitor to uh\nTo Amazon right now they've been locked in combat for years they're they're both trying to uh become number one and uh as as Amazon has

eight hundred seven three six three six six six were talking about Amazon raising its\nMinimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for all of its workers fulltime part-time seasonal or what have you is that a good idea you know they really kind of have to do that because we're listen to this\nUh in July there were seven hundred fifty seven thousand a retail job openings across the United states at seven hundred fifty seven thousand open jobs that employers can't fill because they can't find people\nThat's about a hundred thousand more of these retail job openings and existed a year ago that's according to something I saw in the wall Street Journal and unemployment is low a three point nine percent in August so companies have to do something\nAnd unemployment is low a three point nine percent in August so companies have to do something you know it's a shrewd strategy I Would think on Amazon's part to get some workers in there and uh they have um\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand employees plus a hundred thousand seasonal workers that has a lot of folks who will have more money to spend on buying things on Amazon so let's find out what folks think about that let's go down to ... to Florida good morning Peter\nGood morning how are you today I'm feeling pretty good and yourself\nAs a matter of fact I'm a business owner of the supply business right now ... and you speak\n... so you must have to put in long hours to run your own business absolutely\nAbsolutely I think it's hard for Amazon to raise rates of market demand but ours is certainly going up\nAnd I encourage and it got very disturbed by the second part of the news stories that I've heard that after they do so they're going to support a mandatory raise the minimum wage that's all I think that the problem\nThat I Wonder if they're doing that because they just think it's a good idea or because they were are given a level playing field so that the other organizations have to do the same thing might be harder for them\nThat's exactly right they are going to do it in order to crush the competition that does have the cash ordered to raise their weight you know what it is but\nIt's one of those you know if it's just one of those things as you know as you pull from one end and you pull it away from another and it's like whack a mole and it's just it's very very difficult to figure out where the sweet spot is on these things and I know we're kind of missed argue over it for decades and decades and politicians argue over it so uh\nI guess what's good for Amazon is good for Amazon we'll see if it's good for the country in business in general anyway listen I Know you have to get to work and you know you're the backbone of the country what you're doing so we appreciate that thank you for that and thanks for the call\nCall back again let's go up the coast to New Hampshire good morning Joan in Belmont\nGood morning find that you're on the air\nThe whole country was something that you are right now\nI work in a ditch their clothing and I'm there for Twenty years\nAnd for that to put their pay rates Fifteen dollars an hour I think that's great but I don't know what they're going to do for the people that have been there for years and years and I just getting up to that point\nOh I see I see I see yes and use your frame that now it might stop your upper and pay mobility because they've had they have to pay everybody up to that point I see\nYou know that had not even a come to my I didn't even thought about that before again it's always unintended consequences when you do these things you try to help one group it seems to be might hurt another I Do think it's going to affect a lot of folks where you work in maybe have a negative impact\nAs well because we can't keep workers either\nThat or we call the door and I just really it's the center also because we can't keep people I think because the pay it's very demanding by Don I Walk at least twelve by the day for a
