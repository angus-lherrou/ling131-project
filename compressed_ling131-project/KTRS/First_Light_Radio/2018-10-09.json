or the patience legal surrogates\nI think ah just to other states California and Virginia offer abroad greenlight protections like those in Texas so most states don't allow this but we have about California Virginia Texas I guess um which which uh you know has these complicated laws dealing with this unbelievably complex situation\nAs I said there's a little girl at the center of this now we don't know if the little girl is still in their\nDoctors say she's gone there is no brain activity the girl the little girl little Payton is no longer there just the shell is left being kept artificially resuscitated they're artificially having respiration by a machine they say it's cruel to the child\nTo keep the body in that state the parents say we need more time now what is happening here they they had some legal action is back and forth over the weeks and they were given two weeks to find another place to take the child\nAnd that's proving to be very very difficult it seems to me that you might want to have if you're going to have a law saying that a hospital has that kind of awesome power over the wishes of uh parents\nThan that there must be a way to deal with the parents' wishes as well there should be a way to mandate that another facility would have to take that child I Would think\nThat's not the case in in Texas the parents are left on their own there and ah they could lose their child against their wishes I mean we know the child is probably lost already but shouldn't we respect that family's wishes at least until they can come to terms of what they have to do\nThe mom whose name is Tiffany ... said this is as a day or two ago as of right now they have not found a facility but they remain hopeful there\nShe says people are sending them different locations all across the country that they think or I might want to take a\nOr the girl and they're they're keeping up on that here's here's a quote from the mom Peyton never gave up on anything and I know that in this situation\nShe wouldn't give up either the fact that the doctors told me that her heart would stop on its own this weekend and she's still alive she's still made it until today that lets me know that Peyton is not done she still here to fight so I'm her voice I'll do it for her and\nSo that's the situation we find ourselves in the morning it really is no good answer but there must be something better than the family losing the right to ah to make a final determination like that maybe they just need time to come to grips with it\nUm you know you're told you know you have a child you love the child you have an active life with that child and then the child gets sick and ends up like this must be very very difficult probably nothing more difficult in your life would you ever experience and having to make a decision like this and then you have doctors coming along and saying we're making the decision for you\nNow it seems cruel it seems arbitrary but the doctors also have a have a responsibility to their patient the girl is the patient knocked the parents can so the doctors are saying we are in charge of this girl and this girl's treatment and it is our medical opinion [noise]\nUh that this girl is gone she's brain dead you can keep their body going for you know who knows another year or two years or however long before the\nThe whole system collapses but the girl was never coming back and it's cruel to keep the child that way I mean who's right who was wrong I don't know every situation is also probably different I don't know that one law fits all but\nTell me what you would do in a situation like this you know would you\nHow do you find a facility that would take the child if nobody wants to take on that burden I don't know if the parents could pay for that that's got to be awfully expensive [noise] uh I don't know what the insurance situation is in Texas it's not one of the more advanced states with insurance health insurance\nSo we

talking about that because this is such a\nBasic question who gets to decide when it comes down to things like who gets medical care and food and water and air pumped into your body for doctors you know when they work on this license\nOr an air pumped into your body for doctors you know when they work on this life sustaining treatment for patients who are beyond saving that's emotionally taxing for the doctors to\nAnd they have to worry about their oath to do no harm to their patients doctors say it's wrong to continue the measures that cannot meaningfully help the patient\nHere here's a physician or who helped craft that law in Texas He wrote I took an oath to do things for the benefit of the patient what I'm doing now is for the benefit of the grieving family it's wrong to do something to a patient only for the benefit of the family so\nPutting the patient over the needs of a of the parents in this case but is that a good idea\nLet's find out what you're saying let's go to
