we'll just see what's going on to make sure you know the neighborhood is on fire and then I probably walk back inside and I started editing girl talk which is a you know on the weekends not the real deal\nAre no civilians\nSo to speak up\nWhat were your neighborhood like mine was\nNot really we all got along so well and parents took care of and you know all the neighborhood kids we actually during holidays especially Halloween\nWe would have a parade that went through the neighborhood you know block off the street and police were involved in that so it was just really neat that we would have this parade all the kids get dressed up\nAnd it was south county where I grew up and it was just wonderful and and a lot of the neighbors are still there and my parents and I see and every time I go home and it's just it's a great feeling because everybody was ... everybody knew each other's name all the kids were about the same age as really cool\nAnd all the neighbors organized these parades not neighbor so it just see right through this now do they even everybody being their little cars a costume wave and just have a good time you met\nA mine mainly you know gang violence and shooting August ... ... ... ... it was okay there were a lot of people my age that we did have fun kind of playing in the coldest acts like playing sports basketball whatever anybody wanted to play that day\nAnd we used to have like Christmas parties and New York sometimes Thanksgiving little get togethers but ever since then not that it's like gone downhill it's just new people have moved in over time you know I'm Still like\nTo be honest with you I Can't name everybody on my street anymore I could do it real easy back when but now\nMost of the people are different you know and a lot of people don't come outside anymore which is\nSad in her neighborhood mail well I have the best story about good neighbors you guys are going to love this cat the felt as they sixty six year old woman who lives in a suburb outside of Salt Lake city okay\nShe has lived there for four decades or so this totally reminds me of like my mom's neighborhood growing up\nFor the past ten years though she has had a really hard time in her home and she has MS and for a long time she has been in a wheelchair\nRight after her diagnosis her two sons would drive to her house every morning and every night to help her get into and get out of that good because she's in a wheelchair\nWell her knees hers all started talking to each other and they realize that the sons were spending upwards of forty minutes a day in the car just to come help their mom and they decided to step in\nTo so for the last ten years a rotating cast of volunteers of neighbors show up every single night like clockwork to help her get in law suite isn't it and that's the kind of neighborhood you want to be a part\nIn the air suite isn't it and that's the kind of neighborhood you want to be a part of the ad so this all started with the guy who lives directly behind her and they've been neighbors and friends for thirty eight years now there are sixty men on a schedule they visit to at a time\nAnd there are more neighbors who want to sign up to come help caffeine\nGet and I every night I Wonder how much stuff they've taken out around the\nOrange bright in Philly go wrong with you or whatever conflict and have they bark at all [laughter]\nNeighborhood used to be and you're in a problem for a minute\nAnd that's a lot of people in our neighborhood volunteered I mean I I Can't even name six maybe more my neighborhood alone be we would hope yeah\nEvery night for ten years so they've been able to keep her out of the nursing home which nursing homes are so expensive\nBut moreover she wants to be in her home yeah you're right and to be there so how she pays them is she remembers\nAll of these volunteers birthdays gives them a birthday card every year now and treat or a little gift now Kathy can't get out of our house very well so she has a group of girlfriends who will do the shopping for her to offer I\nIsn't that good yeah that's fun you know I mean I really miss\nThat about my neighborhood because you know I've kind of grown up and moved away and I don't know any of my neighbors now that one of them well\nYou know and not to bore you but uh you know when we bought that house ... several months back in the neighborhood that we're we're moving into eventually is next to the one that I grew up in ... it's a nice neighborhoods and\nHere's the deal I only know like one or two neighbors on the street that I live on and they've been very nice and friendly I haven't even been invited to a party or two and one neighbor's house but the rest of these people\nThere is I mean it really you don't think the neighborhood of deserted even though everybody is yards are perfectly manicured you'd be we will pull in their garage doors clothes shoes are close I mean what are they doing in their early

people want to hear from though are two\nKey senators and I know you know who I'm asking about of course the guy from Arizona and a gal from the lake Senator Susan Collins\nWhere they have right now\n[laughter] you know we heard from Senator Jeff Flake and he said that that's real court shows no cooperation to the allegations made by Dr Ford or the other woman accusing judge Kavanaugh\nWe can just trying to gather what we can learn from that statement and just wait and see how he decides to vote whether for or against judge Kavanaugh\nNow as far as Senator Susan Collins she she also she said something along the same mind she called this report very thorough and so it's it was surprising to hear from them so quickly that one senator who is also a key\nShowing vote in the whole process is Senator Lisa Murkowski she has not yet made a comment about the other two are that are actually Democrats and that were on on the fence and couldn't make have a um\n[noise] we could be the deciding vote here our Senator Joe Manchin is senator\nHeidi Heitkamp who came out and said she was going to vote no now this was one senator who her she ended up for reelection the metrics that it's not looking so good so she herself just seeing all the ... she was going to vote politically this she was going to do with her conscience and she was going to vote with her heart\nAnd she said she just couldn't do it for judge Kavanaugh so\nBut right now we know that there are just two boats\nThat are against judge Kavanaugh all over the weekend it's his nomination and then who knows what'll

right there at distinct taste in these brownies I mean would you automatically know and if the kids recognize it obviously they've tasted before\nYeah John Carney was there he would\nNow but John Carney if you're listening calling in and if you have had a pot brownie call in and let us know what it tastes like through in four nine six nine Katie are as guys this kind of almost maybe happened to me oh so after I finished my master's in Illinois I\nWas applying for reporting jobs all over the country ... and before I got my job I was sitting at my old high school teaching Spanish [noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSpanish oh yeah so the very last day of my ten year of teaching Spanish for high school at that they had a pork burgers sales in a small farming community and that's what they\nDo so naturally I bought the poor bird is done on a farm girl and I like pork burgers sure and I bought him from my mom and dad and took them home for lunch go back that afternoon and they're starting to be rude or it's swirling about how maybe kids put marijuana\nIn them or um [noise] so is this happens on a friday I launched a find a job road trip that following week and we can talk about that another time 'cause it's a great story and\nI get offered a job in Charleston South Carolina and part of the job offer is I had to submit to a drug test or forty eight hours so by the time the offer was made and I had to do this drug test I\nHad maybe had the pot brownie or the pot port burger like ten days apart\nSo I called my mom freaking out oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh mom do you think this pop pork burgers and there's a lot of my career already over\nThe past the drugs are I mean\nIt really does it makes you think because\nYou know what's funny about that is in every sport playoff forgotten ... gotten so long um there is a championship or play are hangover frequently end whereas\nIt really does change your with your experience that and that it was something that you have to think about it is a real thing and um but she's in a long long Hasan they're calling the ups and downs and I think\nUm first segment of the season whether that's kind of games or a month or six weeks or what have you tried the coach right you get this is talk and club mesh together and\nYou know the wind the lines of the way they match you up and who plays well together and all of those sorts of things and what do you hope is that in this feeling out period you could also when you're doing\nAnd that means you're in pretty good shape um season to me doesn't really begin until after Christmas but let's turn now that you can figure things out and it's still early when while you're doing\nSo rumor kind of what's your take on the whole situation at the enterprise dinner with the new mobile um tickets maybe you've heard about that by now he ...\nWell for me I still write things down in pencil and I'm I'm always afraid that the greatest go down and so what if the grid goes down when I Want to go to the game what am I going to do that\nGoing to be a real certainly\nWhat am I going to do that was going to be a real certainly\nI'm a little paranoid about it I'm Still not one that is a smart\nPhone when I get on an airplane you know I heard it out paper that that's a long way to say I'm it would make me a little bit nervous but I Want to walk up there and my phone goes dead\nYou know what I'm hearing but we'll be able to do so\nBy the way the world now and um you know I think it's probably um a smart\nThing to do for the blues to do have they conducted that way and they're not concerned about the demographic better they're more concerned about the demographics that are you guys and the people that are even a little bit younger and your girl on your phone and that's the way it is and so they're smart to do it\nIn the enterprise center employees will figure it out quickly than the game tonight they have the game of Thrones did experience tomorrow night in their back on the ice against the Blackhawks on Saturday Night so a lot of activity happening at the enterprise and the next few days\nOr any of you guys a game of Thrones people\nI Know\nWho who who you dress up as if you were going\nTo dress up as generic storage area and you know you know I don't know don't you know I go\nSee her hair dressed up as the queen yeah I probably would I mean she just seemed like the right person for me to I mean I\nI feel like I associate more with her and her ability to control dragon weird way more they want to know about you know you asked ranchers\nDown that path it's salt sour\nCream or I have to ask about one of my favorite guys in major league baseball of course a lot of high school I look\nAt how about ... oh my gosh what an opportunity\nAnd not only did he get the opportunity with both of those big Barney air ... where there's bad and um\nTo get out there and get the triple last night um I just really happy for the kids you know we talked

root for and so that's fine\nSo when the Yankees take on Boston\nAre there any\nSt Louis connections to the red Sox\nWell Joe Joe Kelly who is one of the guys got pictures out of the Sox bullpen came
