you are\nVery good okay so ah let's talk about this I'm a current event it's heading north\nWe're thinking about sending up through a five thousand troops south at the border let me ask you a quick question because I haven't seen a lot of reaction\nPolitically about this from people who say you know we need to give them refuge hum let's talk on that ... you know and we're near the midterms I mean we can't be any closer were about a week away\nUm what kind of political implications does this has\nWell and a lot of it you're probably going to hear beginning tonight because the announcement was only held about an hour ago where all the details came out of exactly what this is going to be but\nIt's fifty two hundred active duty troops heading that way and the the timing on this can't be ignored I mean we are eight days away from the mid term is the caravan won't be here for quite a while because of slowly they'll go I got twenty five miles a day at most in there a thousand miles away\nThat they no doubt about it that this is something that the White House can use as look what we're doing here\nBut we haven't heard a lot of reaction from Democrats no doubt they're going to be jumping in and saying whatever they're going to say but\nThere is ... there there's some nuance to this whole thing because the headline is definitely that there are troops heading to the border but because of the coma taught us\nThose troops can't do any actual enforcement and this is the same thing that we dealt with when the national guard way than\nThere are there as a supporting role so a lot of it is kind of smoke and mirrors so that may be though is in the caravan get word that there are troops on the border but don't hear that they can't actually stop them that this is Jeffrey border patrol agents so\nThat the troops will build fences and won't put up tents and fly helicopters and do a transport to move the border patrol agents around but it's the border patrol agents who have to do the actual enforcement\nAnd Alex I'm Glad you brought that up because whenever I heard this news I just kept thinking let's visual going to be five thousand men and women can't scanning\nAlong our debate at least he'll be there as long as\nThey don't actually interact or do any law enforcement role is going to be different though that these troops if they are okay to to carry a weapon normally when they're deployed they are authorized to to carry a weapon in this assignment and and normally when the national guards men and women go down\nThere digging ditches I mean they really are when we went along with them they're digging ditches for fencing and you\nKnow building building there doing work they don't have a gun over their shoulder and they're they're not typically arm these folks are being told they can bring their weapons and they're shot out they could shoot back but but they wouldn't have a first interaction with the with any of the illegal immigrants trying to come across but\nStill were ways away this is right now forty five day deployment the troops are already en route they started even before the announcement today this is being called operation faithful patriot\nTheir route that attack this then they will go to Arizona and then they will go to California got it seemed to be skipping over New Mexico but but they're going to begin by doing their work in Texas where the first round\nYou know and I know that this is kind of a rallying cry for increased border protection and or is there anyone that feels that these people should you know have free access to entering the United states I mean I Can't\nMay I ask are you referencing my my world series pick that went around by\nBut that was mine as well [laughter] but I think it was more than just the ticket was wishful thinking yeah you know the best team in baseball wanted no question about it I don't know\nIf you guys have seen this kind of circulating around
