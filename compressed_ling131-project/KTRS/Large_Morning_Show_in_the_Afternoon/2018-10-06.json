McCann before the teams left the field for a second time was popping balls in from beyond forty yards out and so you know perhaps an opportunity\nSo interesting electrical a which will be at least an hour in real time to think of this you know potential game winning drive so Derrick Julie the coordinating the coaches are in there\nWith plenty of time to devise design thinking about what plays they want to run and obviously the fence of guys will will counteract down south Carolina but what an odd deal to prepare for the final one two forty wars or any kind of\nCome up with something maybe that ah that that wasn't originally in the game plan and now and I think back to a game and misery played at home or what it was a member of the big twelve\nPockets Oklahoma State and before the final drive I remember my gundy sitting back on an equipment lock her up there ... diagram he plays with that came out running eventually would be Missouri here's the other thing too that we have to point out that we haven't talked about we've talked about the field we talked about that there were standing water we also talked about\nHe runs the meeting set the table and uh they help guide me through it as along the way it was built by week kind of special for your football to our our guys did a great job we we handled field coming off the Georgia law use it as a normal Sunday on on getting through the film [noise]\nPutting that wasn't behind us and then immediately start on the really a game plan for South Carolina we had a couple of bonus practices on them and then our guys at a great job on on attacking at a in the right manner and they were very mature and their approach on how they did it hard to imagine are already a one third of the season complete a three and one\nJust a thought through the first four games on kind of weird there's team is right on\nThat was really fast so you know you're already in the end of the middle section of of your schedule as you mentioned an and I think the thing that I've seen that grows\nA on both sides of the ball some things that we've done really well we're going to keep on moving the direction that our team is but also it it gave us a chance to\nStep back grand scope and\nScheme and lens of all the aspects of our game on how we can get better I'm proud of our all kinds of line on how we've moved three or four weeks will be a little a block and run the football that's got to be an advantage for us moving forward and I think on both sides\nAs you get an FCC play both sides on his privilege it's so important and being able to control that part of the game and I think we've got an opportunity to do that for\nYou to talk about that a little bit later in the program in the meantime let's go back to the Georgia game itself that goes for the benefit of this audience we haven't really had a chance to talk about that you had a chance to uh\nHave a week away from me last week when tiger talk with Jim struck with was what was your take away from all your team played against the war was concerned direction but concluded that point well\nNumber one I missed the last Thursday night drew and that was on the road recruiting and that was good but also you look back at the Georgia game and then there were times during the game [noise]\nUh that we were in control of it and then there are other times because we turn them all over and we got to walk for a touchdown any time that you walk away from a game and you're minus\nOr three in the turnover margin and you get a ... for a touchdown you're not going to win the game but yet we found ourselves it was eleven forty game and the fourth quarter we had the ball [noise] uh the resiliency that our guys showed and continue to fight\nAnd and work through and make plays we had opportunities we weren't that far off but but yet we never could take the next step\nOn on taking control of the game and and making things happen in our favor [noise] um you know you're you're frustrated with the laws but also there's things that we took from that game that will continue to help those field and become a stronger in and move to the program forward [noise]\nI think you subscribe to the theory you should never have a potluck [noise]\nThat's absolutely I mean you should go you should get really should go years without that happened and we had a winter break down and in a protection and and we've got to do a better job coaching it and then we got to go executed and and that can't\nCan't happen what did you think about the job that they did defensively particularly in the way that they were defending your parent's game and stretching the field vertical\nTogether and then they took away most of the deep south there we had a couple of shots that we didn't connect on a also we look back and and maybe\nAt times you know with with some of the things that were having success running the ball or early on maybe look back at it would we change any of those things where to play down the field but also underneath [laughter]\nYou know we had a couple of other drives going one down south to shoulder pads and then ended up in a in an interception [noise] um there are a couple of times those drives us we didn't really get going so that the Georgia they did a great job on on doing some things there there's a limit to that they're really good teams but we're not that far\nOff went to the second half were screened parents to to to learn around who set a perfectly was the perfect call and he just couldn't hang oval\nShe has a little bit behind him um regardless you know with the point of attack walked really well we had room to run and uh you know the the number one priority is the mole hill end up with it number one on the planes over you got to play catch and we didn't do that a couple of times with [noise]\nUm [noise] you know I think of the guys learn a great deal about ourselves and and it's going to help us as we get going down here in the heart of the schedule\nWas due football coach very autumn is with us Kelly were live from memorial stadium fro field in Columbia on the east side for the second and you'll still the tigers have been some

it's a life change or right I mean one we're not working anymore we're not going to be accumulating any more money but how do I actually take all this stuff that I've saved all this money out of these accounts instead of just taking you know monthly distributions of accounts how do I do it in a way that I keep this money\nYeah it was an a ha moment for him because I think he says in the in the email I Will I listen to your show and this is the first time I realized I don't have a plan to take my money out right\nYeah he doesn't have a plan to take it out um anything about him and you folks think about this you might have this financial advisor you've been with for maybe a year maybe five years maybe ten maybe twenty maybe they'd been helping you out since the first day you got a job I I don't know\nBut have you ever really talked about how you're going to get this money yeah in fact I Would say that conversation should have started before you saved the first dollar right\nNow we don't know what taxes are going to be in the future\nRight we don't understand you know what a day you're going to retire and we don't know all that stuff\nBut when we can do start making assumptions and that's where I come in because I only work with people within five years of retirement\nSo those those numbers of retirement get closer and closer and we have a more of a clearer picture of the age we want to retire the date we want to retire some people specifically as soon as I hit thirty seven years I'm gone from the company but you know um but I think what we got to do is first off say okay\nWhat do I want what am I trying to do how do I do in the most tax efficient way how do I keep my money and we should have all these answered before we retire\nRight and it's so important I learned this from the show uh this guy doesn't have a distribution of going to have a plan to take it out because we know listening to the show\nThat if you're a twenty five year old and you make fifty thousand dollars and there's another one twenty five year old a mixed fifty thousand dollars you have roughly the same tax bill\nNo matter what you do you have roughly soon as the energy to auction somebody's house but I mean it's all the same but if you're in retirement and somebody's making fifty thousand dollars in somebody else's making fifty thousand dollars depending on where the money's coming from somebody's paying a whole lot in taxes and somebody else's paying zero in tax\nYou know what I Love that you're you know this is I mean yeah I mean you think about that if this couple's making fifty in this topples making fifty are they going to the same tactical that's their\nRight probably now right right but but but\nWhen you say taxes in retirement are different and this guy says wait a minute how am I going to get my money out when you're twenty five and you're making fifty thousand dollars it's the same you know whether you're making it a ... at the grocery store or at a hardware store is still the same money being taxed at the same way still earned income\nIs still being taxed the same way but remember when we're retired\nWe don't pay FICA anymore Ryan right we don't we don't pay that that uh that Social Security tax and so I think it's important to know how we're going to be pulled our money out of the different accounts like this individual says hey\nI don't have a plan I really don't have a plan and most people will pay more for their vacation and they do actually for retirement yeah we're we're throwing money away and we're putting money inside these four one K. and all these other things but how do we take it out folks here's how you take it out very very simple\nYou do it in a way so you pay the least amount of money on tax which is called you do that right depends upon every person situation is different\nBut I'll tell you this is not how you set up a retirement plan folks\nAre now I'm going to make a lot of people mad here a lot of these commissions sales people of America man how you don't do it is just put it into an annuity and just get a lifetime check right\nIt sounds simple it sounds like it would work but that's not how you do it why one because most likely that check will never ever increase you want to keep up with inflation right if you're a unique firebrand today per month or ten thousand twenty thousand whatever it is per month\nYou want that to be higher next year by at least four percent and you want to four percent higher than that and you want to four percent higher than that and then one day that five thousand dollar check\nNeed to be ten and Fifteen and twenty\nNot because you want to go buy a lot more stuff is because of that stuff cost a lot more I typically those types of the new to you don't have any cost of living adjustments to them and if they do I have yet to see one that actually increases by four percent which is the average rate of inflation right\nAnd the other thing is is why that strategy doesn't work as it has nothing to do with taxes at all it's just a way of giving your money to an insurance company they give you a check for the rest of your life right\nI look I guilty as charged I Will do things and I think we all do things why do we do things because it's easier to do it\nThen to hear the wrath of not doing it right it's easier you know what it's just I've known the guy for a hundred years we're really not friends anymore but it's his wife and my ... let me just fine I'll just put up with it I if I just grin and bear it I'll put up with it it's fine\nRight or or or my my financial called financial adviser um\nWe do this thing once a month where a bunch of us old guys from from ah from high school we all get together and we play golf together right and and you know it would be very awkward to not have him right financial advisors and one of my\nGuys and third grade we do this thing once a month he's from my Bible study he's from my church he is at my kids' school he's my coach he's my kids coach or some\nSort of connection here and it's just difficult to break that relationship folks if there are friends they're going to like you no matter what if you were with them or not with them but I mean you think about this um [noise]\nI think you would be difficult for me to tell\nMy friends or someone I've been with a really long time that they're not doing a good job right like if I'm not satisfied but I'm not talking about like rates of return okay 'cause that's pretty easy but you know I'm not satisfied because I'm not getting the information I deserve because every time I go in for my review\nWe talk about my account a little bit but more or less we're just talking about the old days where I kind of catching up or asking about the family you know not not seen any of that stuff not important but we are talking about the plan right\nFive seconds is on the investments we never once talked about the plan and then you think about it and say let's say you come into my workshop and you learn all this stuff about tax is okay and you learn how to how to pull your money out you're not paying taxes and your your your your your eyes get opens right okay\nAnd you you know you would you want to come into the office and let's see we go through the whole plan and everything looks good and you want to make a change\nIt's hard to break that relationship right 'cause we've been with them so long as you kinda feel like you're cheating on your act yeah you feel like you feel like you're cheating on your guy and now you're here at this point and you're like you know I got a call right and I always say\nIf it was me I Would want that phone call right why because I Want to find out what I did wrong what did I Do that didn't know that made you go somewhere else and then they always say well what do I say I say\nNow you're working with somebody who specializes in retirement okay now I Know that sounds pretty basic but that's real the real thing and so when you call them up and you tell them that they said well what do you mean special what do you think I Do I specialize in retirement started getting defensive well they're showing me these tax strategies right\nI can do that so then you stay there right okay because I can do that because I hear this a lot I can do that but if you can why haven't you been doing it that's the question that is the question of folks if you're stuck\nIn this situation and you see something that is better than we're you war why aren't you change and right so I was asking my office about this okay so it's a really happen very much in my office but I asked this question in my office I said\nGuys why don't people to make changes when they know they're not getting the information that they deserve threat\nAnd I thought about it and I was like you know what I Do that myself you know we're all guilty of it I'm guilty of that too\nWhen I go see my general practitioner okay I remember why I don't want to be there anymore\nBecause he makes me wait in his waiting room for about thirty minutes past my appointment and then I sit in my office in the uh the patient room\nFor another forty five minutes and then he finally gets in and I'm like I'm a little mad you know like how do you how dare you violate my time like that and I would understand if it happened one time up in happened but it happens every single time\nAnd then when I talk to him on fight afterwards threat from like you know what I'm not changing he's a good guy he he seems like he cares about me I\nJust dawned on me the other day when I spoke with my office they said I Am doing the exact same thing that I think that people shouldn't do right and I said I'm going to find me a new doctor and in fact I'm going to find me a new doctor why am I going to find a new doctor because my doctors too busy\nMy doctor sees every single person from past pediatrician too about death right he doesn't specialize in nothing he's a general practitioner he's a good guy\nBut he never caught my issue I had to go through surgery I had to go through not breathing for a long period of time or a point where I thought I was going to die\nAnd I'm Still with this guy right now that I'm Talking about this I Need a nutritionist they do an allergy test now I'm breathing because I'm not eating that garbage that I was eating before that was killing me right right [noise]\nSo I'm victim of that too and I said this just doesn't make sense why would I stay in this type of relationship because he's a good guy right he's a nice guy but you know what I think he's violated my trust too many times that I've found where I should move somewhere somewhere else I should be\nThe other thing too is a nurse you write a nurse a year and a better relationship with a girl a doctor or a barber you know your dry cleaner your your uh your financial guy as a nurse\nYou know what I got a man he knows all my account number as I got to find my account numbers I got to do that's right I don't know how many times people say oh I hate my bank why they did is less cerebral watch uh well I got my direct deposit and I got to go move is is is a pain in the neck I'll just put up with that you're\nYou're right absolutely right I'm done right All right soon as anytime anybody comes to my office asked me if I found a new doctor or not because I should have found a new doctor a long long time ago in fact if I Would have found a new doctrine that one that I'm working with actually today is my nutritionist I'd still have Eighteen Inches of my colon yeah I'd have been fine you know the whole\nWhile an act and actually that's the other moral to the story when you actually do make the change when you stop the train back it up and go in a different direction not only will you be happier when you've made this change but you realize boy that really wasn't that hard to to begin with them it\nWasn't that hard but why don't we change because what we've been finding with these other financial advisors that we've been interviewing for all the same right\nThere all the same that's the other things do they do the exact same thing they might this one might be managed money this one might be annuity but ultimately all comes down to the investments only same with doctors or general practitioners a lot of them just do the same stuff over and over again and when I asked my doctor\nMy current one that actually found out all this I said I said tell me\nWhy didn't mind on to talk to me about this stuff and she said Kevin the problem with doctors are is they're they only take about three hours of nutrition vats yet but nutrition come\nThree hours of nutrition that's yet\nBut nutrition comes down to making sure that we're doing the right things on eating because what comes into our bodies stays in there and if it if it messes our bodies up should not be something that we should do and they're they're more\nGeared about working on this symptom instead of the actual root cause advisors are more geared towards trying to help you solve that one problem that symptom instead of getting down\nTo the root cause or the other thing too is um I've had three or four quote unquote financial planners which I call them financial planners\nThe all the all four of them were nice all four of them did the exact same thing and I didn't I thought that's what they did until I met Kevin Lloyd until I met you and you're like wait a minute this is the way it's supposed to work I was like wait a minute you what because what you're talking about and what you do is unlike anything when anybody else does\nThat's what I asked I asked that question to every single person that goes through a process in on the third me just ask hey when you went through this information with your advice or what was their strategy to help you out of me so [laughter]\nWhat are you talking about right we didn't do any of this the first time I've ever seen any of this stuff they do that Monte Carlo simulation thing and are looking investments they they they changed the portfolio ... all they do right\nWe've never ever talked about any of this done yeah and uh you know and then some of them they never even talked about my Carlo simulations like okay so what is Judea\nThat's new word to me but you but I had a guy called me up every twice twice a year twice a quarter twice once a quarter hey how's it going good what's up man they got to know what's going on the grid alright I'll talk to and a couple of weeks you not talk to your next month or whatever you told me that that's a they must call you or is that how is that a ruler law so it\nWas so when somebody's doing advisory business threat they have to try to attempt to call one time to schedule an appointment one time of year one time a quarter once a year once a year okay but if you bought a new a T they'll ever after the guy\nTold me except when it's All right I mean if you want to know why your guy and calling your background is because he made all the money up front [noise]\nSee the new ... right right [noise] while a voice Hi Kevin ...\nIs
