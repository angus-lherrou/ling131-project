it's an inheritance ... well another usually catch\nRhino [laughter] you're right there\nAnd you win the lottery which\nWhich you have to explain to me why all of a sudden everybody now will buy a lottery ticket when it's seven hundred million dollars but when it's a hundred million they won't go running\nTo buy and yeah you you know it's ... ... people to call it silly to buy you know you're just throwing your money away are now in line to buy a ticket you know and I don't understand what the brake point is it's like Cuba same odds\nAnd what's the difference between winning a hundred million and and and a billion and all I'm saying it I Know what the difference is nine hundred million [laughter]\nBut um but yes it's true I mean we spend all that money where your lifestyle\nChange if you have a hundred million burned down six hundred\nNow right scratched change a lot from my lifestyle right now [laughter]\nNo right to change a lot from my lifestyle right\nNow [laughter] ten

she's\nThe fed and I sort of surgically have bigger feet maybe I don't think I Do [laughter] so ... free\nStates it's the same I'm Better rates so people say wait a minute what's the catch on that there really isn't a catchall there was a pretty simple math formula okay we're talking mortgages mortgages which you know they can be fun it can be fun\nYou know my wife always falls asleep in the show because we have a show not o'clock every Sunday and she says oh it's called mortgages and more with ... and then when we start talking mortgages she kind of like all this is boring shouldn't worry\nPlus you get to spend all the money so she's concerned about is actually spending it or not you know saving it sounds\nAs she's listening not to I'm Sorry to hear that you have the same we have the same domestication me I mean we make it they spend it and that's what we did was we eliminated the commissions that we paid to loan officers my officers in overland which is a lower budget been ... ... you know\nNow when you say a commission to loan officers I totally get than um than that immediately goes to the\nClients customers in the foreign paying all the closing of them got it so you get the same or better rates and with no cause and\nSomebody says and despair question to ask so how do you make\nMoney but we sell the lawns on a secondary market like most sure institutions do yes they're Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac ensure the government ... just as good a very few are held the pure hell leader as good as doing business with bank of America hair or any other institution\nAnd by doing that if the quality of the loans that we start or can we make enough money to pay the closing costs and just make enough money to do it now\nIf you own a mortgage company you're obligated with Dodd Frank which was this law that came out to not long ago not long ago you're obligated to pay a fixed commission on those loans that your loan officers originate well if you don't have\nLoan officers to pay commissions too you can take that money and pass along the savings to the customers so we built a model\nDid you hear that weight I Want people to get that\nI Want you know and and I say that it's because of the stewards American mortgage is a proud sponsor of the guy Phillip show and so I Want you people who are in the market for mortgages to hear this\nOut of the owners mouth okay now it may seem like well that's called out there for a bunch of people in your office you don't need a bunch of people selling the citizens like you know he's not trying to churn out these these ah [noise] ah mortgages but the benefit is\nTo you at every level I mean it's so if you get a lot of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more you get zero closing costs because you don't have any expenses stripe\nWe're so there is no title fees no appraisal feet every every day I got a call first of all the people you know advertise my cell phone number is some people can't really than they actually answer the phone but you know that's what I Would want in your place\nAnd then when we do is we pay all the closing costs for them is not nothing added no title fees no appraisal the nothing so in essence it ends up being free\nAnd we just built this model based on what Dodd Frank offered to be more competitive and as a result\nWe become I think the single highest producing\nOne officer your climax on our insurance I Am a vibrant am I talking points here okay right say they're like oh yeah yeah do you have a nice message here a while but now you have to listen to heart so it's the highest price somewhat plus I'm trying to come\nHome lately I learned I get back in ...\nHe says I guess ... bag a mortgage from age OK yeah tester comic by [laughter]\nPeople to make phone calls to
