R. S. star Kate T. R. S. were cell phones or one triple eight five fifty K. T. R. S.\nYou know we're in a ... I did receive a couple of calls this week while you were involved in a couple of our Medicare only meetings\nAre constantly ecology is if people do call me every once in a while okay they call me different things so I Can't talk about on the radio but\nUm they did call me on and you know it's interesting 'cause they're asking me really ... I get about fixed income about bonds got it and what most folks don't realize when you think about fixed income a lot of people think about certificates deposit and they don't trade you know you buy a CD has a certain maturity period\nX rated interest strict sort of interested in that period you can renew or the bank you give your money you pay tax on the interest\nBonds work a little differently especially individual bonds you know when you're purchasing an individual security as compared to being in a bond fund\nA what a curse is is that you know you're paying a price either you're buying it at a premium\nPaying a little more or to discount based on that interest rate relationship to current interest rates with bond funds you're buying basically a package of bonds\nAnd some of the questions that I received this week from a client as we were doing a review was you know Jeff I'm looking at my account and I know the insurance horizon 'cause if it's moving up interest rates but my bond funds are going down\nThere having negative returns for this year was that really happening and I think that what most folks do realize I Know you and I do as an investment advisors is that\nAll bond this trade in the market at the same time just like stock straight in the market at the same time right\nI think if we put a number is some numbers today it can be a little bit more understandable so for example if I own a bond that it's a firm ... somebody like that they're they're providing the way that hypothetical bond is they're providing you with two percent interest\nRight\nNow as interest rates rise and all of a sudden on the market there is a body that it had three percent rate of return than my bonded obviously worse last because I'm only getting two percent right whereas that new bonds are worth more\nRight into the market value that bond we'd go down and so if you wanted to sell it you would be selling it at a discount\nSite if you can't get to maturity you would be getting the rate of interest right you get to that lower two percent right and ...\nAnd that's something that you certainly can do in his decision that you have to make 'em especially when you're purchasing the visual boss most folks they they typically are involved in bone funds right where the\nManagers are making those decisions\nRight and as they begin to trade these bonds summer ... and they're buying new ones the problem that they're seeing is that again a lot of times the portfolio value of those bonds as insurance rise bond prices are inverse too that we're seeing those going down so even though they're getting better interest yields\nIt's not enough to overcome the guy's hand on the face amount\nAnd so this week when we saw interest rates spike at three point to three percent which rally it was a spike but not really ... ... well we know they're going there anyways because that's already high rates\nWhat we're looking at is is that I'm born prices went down significantly so what we saw is when the market was declining both sides were in that's really kind of unusual right so again a boy we're looking at safety holding an individual bond to its maturity can't provide principal ... reasonable\nPresent and potential some income\n... risk is low I mean you're buying a bond of a you know a highly rated let's say a high grade corporate or a government paper assumption exactly so you know you can hold that's immaturity and you'll get your money back but again what happens is you may be in a situation like we are today were rising interest rates really cuts into the value of those bonds because\nWhat you like in your ... your ... hypothetical example\nOf only getting too but it's like when I was just getting three ... three center so I'm Out the answer some questions maybe gives a little bit of clarity those folks that are looking at the market's going what is going on around ... it's like we have a diversified portfolio to help us create protection but there are some times\nWhere the markets can move 'em\nIn tandem in tandem in at the same time you know hopefully they\nMove 'em in tandem intend them in at the same time you know hopefully they moved to the good\nRight it was particularly when it was not you know address\nRates go down bond values could go up and do some work is going up the same time that's all real positive but right when it goes the other way it hurts because it feels like it's a double negative yes so like you said before here and I'm having sufficient liquidity in your account not having to sell into a declining market\nWould've does is it really protects your values or at least hopefully that's what that's really what the goal is the goal is to do those will too you're right um I get on the phone lines are open we love to hear from you I think everybody's asleep it's cool\nIs it ready for their money very rapid break in that weather well\nYou know and also I think it's the sunrise thing too I mean sunrise didn't come up today until almost seven o'clock that is late\n[laughter] it's really kind of cool off so I Believe you're from your family here nine six nine key T. R. S. stark E. T. R. S. or cell phones or one\nTriple eight five fifty K. E. T. R. S. [noise] so we want to go next ...\nWell I Know that while you are enjoying your time in Arizona I met last thought and Sally\nDid you get are they doing\nWell these are new Bob and salad oh okay well that's great they're related to the other bought since alleys of our\nPast exactly\nThey're related in this way okay they can't wait to retire so that's how they relate first time I heard that this day that's exactly right and this is a pretty cool wonder both sixty six K rough currently work loves the grownups say our normal retirement age Sally wants\nOut she is ready to leave as soon as possible we've heard that one before that Bob Bob to work a couple more years\nThat's what she says [laughter]\nI think she made Bob Said that okay I figured that may have been threats before they came in I have no part of that\nYou know it's kind of interesting because a lot of times we're visiting with folks you know it's usually the other way which is ... ... you don't know how that is ready to write housekeepers or the way it was like no I Love by work I'm not going in because she doesn't want to be at home with them\nWell this person well Sally is a genius yes because not only does she get to retire but she's going to send ... to work for at least two more years oh yeah\nThat would like to exactly so ... ... ... and we found out that um they're spending about three thousand dollars a month\nOkay so the question was what really actually Sally question was how quickly can average higher and I know you were thinking ... I was thinking well let's see well make it happen with Sally ...\nAnd also a bottom Sally here worked ... where they\nKnow they were not they have they did an incredible job\nOver their lifetimes of ... of their working life of saving they have over a million dollars and assets but the cool thing is is that\nAlmost a quarter of that is an after tax money so they have some extra liquidity that many people that are approaching retirement do not have because\nUm we all follow the conventional wisdom of let's take put as much as we can into our retirement accounts if they're available take the tax deduction on the front end and oftentimes that leaves very little of additional savings in savings accounts or um brokerage accounts that are not inside of qualified policy plans\nBut Bob and Sally has two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of after tax dollars which can be very helpful in the future\nYou know I think we're going to talk a few minutes about it in a few minutes about um what do they do with all that cash\nAttached right the first we have to talk about the levers on\nLine one Bob Bob's on the line right what he wants to talk about that Richard premium question that you had okay Bob good afternoon or good morning it looks like afternoon out their welcome to the show\nThank you [laughter] yeah I'm really confused but I've heard advertised on TV quite a bit but I don't grasp the concept how can they return your premiums in on it just doesn't make any sense to me\nBob I mean what happens is is that a way you were what they do is is that you pay an extra premium\nOn top of the normal term insurance premiums typically level premium ... contract and so what happens is is that if you don't use it over ten twenty Thirty years with they'll then do is they take that extra premium they invest that money for you and then they hand it all back to you at the end of the day\nAnd they usually invest that in the insurance companies assets right\nSo it's a return of ... if you don't use the contract\nSo you have to pay a premium to get this benefit which is how they're able to do it right\nOh you pay an extra premium to get\nTheir premiums exact there's always a catch ... which were [laughter]\nBut I mean let's be real here because we know the term insurance is really very similar to if you want to think of it\nYou're you know like your homeowner's your auto insurance if you don't wreck your car you don't collect anything well tournaments the same way if you don't do you collect from the insurance company so you're saying you give us a little extra will invest that over a long period of time and if you are right and we're wrong\nOr what a cruises will give your money back but again they've had to use your money for a long period of time actually exactly so I Hope that helps you\nWe're going to talk about James James\nHe is currently paying three hundred and thirty dollars a month for a plan as a supplement\nThat's ... that is correct also so everyone turning sixty five be aware that the premium goes up one to five percent annually and that doesn't include is paying for the cure it doesn't include what are you paying for Medicare also doesn't include his prescription drug plan which is thirty dollars a month\nSo we're looking away free sixty a month yeah and that works out folks just four thousand three hundred dollars a year\nA lot of money for it so it certainly is so it's more and more capable and that's a lot of money [laughter] [noise]\nSo when we sat down with James and chatted with him about his current health care situation he mentioned to me that he's seen a physician once a week he's seeing a pain management specialist once a week before it is not fun for a couple of reasons one 'cause you're in pain but to\nIf you're if you have something like ... you have to pay Kobe's every single time you go there you go but here's the kicker which\nIs he's paying forty three hundred dollars annually\nFor his premiums for his supplement uh-huh maximum out of pocket on a Medicare Advantage plan is thirty four hundred dollars\nAnd so you're doing to recoup her I'm\nGetting to the co pay part so even in the worst case scenario\nLet's say poor James has to see the physician every single week every week of twenty Nineteen or what should be praying while he's going to pay forty dollars a visit to the time she chewy year that's two thousand eight hundred two thousand eighty dollars\nAnd all that money\nAll that hard that's right all that money is applied to his maximum out of pocket which is about thirty four hundred dollars depending upon what policy issues are a lot of different options out there this year so even if he saw the physician once a week even if he had some other care that he needed he's still\nA thousand dollars away from the maximum out of pocket and two thousand dollars away from the premium that he's been paid so you could have the same access to care the same you use of care and then a lot of situation you're still going to save money\nThat's fabulous and this doesn't even include\n\nAll of the extra benefits that many of these policies offer\nHearing aid assistance Medicare does not cover the devices some companies do offer hearing aid assistance like our ... dental assistant so cleaning exams in X rays and some companies have even expanded that to include\nA certain types of dental work ... um feelings extraction bridges crowns those types of things that you know people need like ... ... silver sneakers\nLike every ... like ... which is\nYou know forty bucks could be forty dollars a month because it's a free gym membership you can join any Jimmy like that as many as you like that except the silver sneakers plan\n[noise] twenty five dollar there are some companies that offer over the counter benefits was overthrown like covered but United in essence also offered this as well in school um\nMoney that you can use to pay for over the counter items like anything from cue tips to zero tech to chap stick band aids you order it out of the uh insurance companies catalog they mail it to you know extra charge to use some companies do it monthly some do it on a quarterly basis but\nThat some extra benefit to you that I was you know and her bucks here and also\nCoventry specifically added this and it's a very I think this would be considered as a unique benefit also very specific one so Coventry noted Coventry sent out a questionnaire to its members and ... they are constantly asking and I know the the other insurance companies do this as well [noise]\nWhat do you need what do you like about the plan what do you dislike about the plan what would you like to see at it and so in the upcoming year what are they have added specifically to their benefits are twelve near meals post admitted to the hospital too out of here so what that means is if you've been admitted to the hospital\nWhen you're discharged and you go home you can call Coventry and they will send you twelve meals pre made in a cooler type container you put it in the fridge and then you have access to it\nFor you know that's almost a week's worth of meals and what they determined was that people were being re admitted to the hospital after it ... because in some cases if you happen to be on your own and you you can't eat well after you've been in the hospitals\nEspecially because you went on a strict or cook roller coaster for\nExaggerating ... well because you can't in a lot of situations and that's also you know if you don't have sustenance that's hurting your ability to recover so Coventry added this benefit which is very cool ah for people that have been you know discharged from the hospital and obviously anyone can use it even if you you know you're married and\nYou know who your grandkids will come visit you 'cause you're\nExcept take you to have one of the pre made meals but it's a very I don't think it was it's a very nice extra benefits that they've added into\nTheir policies and I'm very cool thing about open enrollment is that you have the opportunity to not only look at the medical benefits and the prescription drug benefits that you currently have and see how they compare to other option but\nThere are cases where some of the these and celery benefits can really make a big difference in what you're paying every year because\nA lot of people don't think about those trips to the wall to wall grains or CBS every once in a while or you pick up the chap stick you pick up the cue tips to that kind of thing or the allergy medicine that you're constantly taking in St Louis\nI'm as part of your medical expense but if we can cut some of that out\nWe know that prescriptions can be more expensive under Medicare so let's do some cost shifting if you can save some money on your over the counter or on your dental or on your trips to the gym we can use those that do those dollars to offset the cost of potentially increase price on your prescriptions you\nKnow we're hearing what strikes me do you use the\nMedicare is awesome and I know making it was obviously in conjunction with these are closed [noise] I Know that it's a scary\nProposition to change health plans especially when you've been used to have a few reporters where you're currently consuming healthcare mhm and then having to make this change on to the government primarily country will controlled Medicare plan the rules would search her\nSon and better every every week\nWhat I like to say when people say oh wow this sounds too good to be true how does it really work\nIf you think about the fact that front ... from the very first paycheck you ever received you have been paying into Medicare\nSo your entire working life you've spent paying for this benefit you should get something back for it and so and you continue to pay for it because however you've selected whatever supplement you've selected for to supplement your Medicare coverage you still have to pay\nElected whatever supplement you've selected for to supplement your Medicare coverage you still have to pay the Medicare part B premium\nFor the rest of your life so you paid in your entire working life and now you're going to continue to pay while you have the coverage\nThat's why Medicare can cover about eighty percent of your medical expenses and the only rule that you play in terms of covering the remaining twenty percent of its figuring out how do you want to pay for it you want to pay for it up front like James was doing before paying three hundred and thirty dollars a month or do you want to pay for it as you actually consume the services\nWhere in some cases you may be paying less\nTo consume care every single week than you'd pay the insurance company to say okay I don't want to have to have a co pay when I go see the pain management doctor\nAnd and you know it's interesting about dreams are situation is because she would ever have you retarded normal retirement age ... or ... years ago ... probably because the Medicare Advantage was really weren't really weren't around and frankly they weren't very good\nThey weren't as good as they have been in the last six years\nExactly so what happens is like many folks eroding our plan a plan for ... and now they're proves you're getting big with Medicare Advantage plans and networks have grown as a benefit to the land is being in the out of pocket max we're coming down to the real algebra heroes in this case he decided to go ...\nThat's exactly right because we can say with certainty that even if he were to sooner and the worst case scenario not only is he ... the pain management specialist once a week\nBut he's also you know something else happened and he hit the thirty four hundred dollars out of pocket maximum\nThat still less than the forty three hundred dollars that he paid in premium and he doesn't have any less access to care he doesn't have any difference in care from what he had before because Oxford that's exactly right because\nAll of the supplement or Medicare Advantage plans or prescription drug plans that are offered are offered by private insurance companies but they all have government contracts which means\nThey all have to follow the rules and regulations of Medicare they have to provide the benefits that Medicare lays out to you so that means that even if you've selected a Medicare Advantage plan and you're using a network like you used to use when you were employed\nYou still have the same access to care the networks are required to be large they cannot create narrow networks like many people here about for individuals under sixty five years old for and\nWhat you like the folks that an hour and stuck with a big no or an better where they have very limited before new health care plan alternative exactly\nThey have limited and they have limited networking also limited numbers of physicians that will accept the policy that Medicare Advantage plans are not allowed to do that because they have to follow Medicare guidelines and also if you select", "show_name": "Large Morning Show in the Afternoon", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis",
