retainer\nHey that like that yeah they don't do it right exactly to wear\n[laughter] All right so this is back in the news I mean judges something you'd back in the news here in St Louis that I'd like to address okay there's a um\nA move unknown glad we do know that he goes to ... do they want concise school um he played a JD soccer for his freshman and sophomore years and as a junior easy a trend for the team and did not make it\nAnd now I'm the mother and apparently the stepfather who happens to be a lawyer who's handling this kid's gays and the judge is going to make a decision and may have already made the decision I haven't heard yet but I'm\n... now has been announced yet\nOkay and so what they're asking for is a temporary restraining order against the district so that he could be put back on the J be soccer team\nThat's what they're asking for\nOkay and and what they say is he's too old usually the G v a team is comprised of freshmen and sophomores and the fact of the matter is that when I coached a I Would but anybody that could not you know what it did not have enough from\nExperience or you know act you're going to be on the GED team it didn't matter what year they were in in school [noise]\nUm but uh let's address that so this is probably not a unique case to the courts but because it's here locally let's see what we\nAre made it is it is fairly unique I mean I think it's very easy for people to look at this and say oh come on you know we'll with its disappointment we've all suffered as a former they didn't make the team\nYou know go out with your life how but at the same time I think that what this case really is about is about um you know a disappointed a kid and her parents who you know like most of us we want to do whatever we can for our children\nAnd uh you know the stepfather happens to be a boy or they're not for money you know this is a lot of people that the court you know it's just everything's about money that they they just wanted the kids to be able to play out but the but I'm like you're when you're a coach or I mean there are limited numbers spots on the team in the schools made a decision that\nThat really is sort of a farm team for developing the talent um to get it ready to hopefully make our cities someday yes as a kid you know gets to a point where they're not going to make our city like this boy wasn't able to do Jodie is not simply a fallback\nOr for that you know you sort of timed out you know you took the sport as far as he could and school doesn't have a spot for you [noise]\nUm so you know what they're basically saying is is that if he had better girl\nBecause I don't think their age discrimination claim has much where um because it's not like he wasn't\nEligible for the varsity team there was a place for him he just didn't make that um so I don't know that that's going to have much of a claim but it is better claim that he has one and I said I'll be honest with you I I really don't think\nThat they're going to rule in in his favor I I think they're just gonna have to deal with the disappointment here are the better claim is probably the one where he says that if you were girl\nGirls offer a JV team for juniors yet apparently the boys don't offer that so it's almost like a reverse title by situation where they're making something available for one gender and not for the other other gender I still think that's a pretty good argument\nOr but I can at least I can only see that one a little bit funny thing is they've got to such great lengths\nTo hide the identity in the lawsuit the boy is just to John Doe at the mother is a Jay do even the lawyer asked the post dispatch not to include is to protect the kids' identity and yet\nIf they're successful uh his that that that he was going to be revealed immediately and I suspect most of the people at school who it is anyway\nYou're kind of a you know that\nI Do have a question about it let's talk timelines here because the soccer season easing over long it's going to end what next couple of weeks\nYeah I mean maybe the ceremonial a it'll be most day ceremonial victory where if they put them all the team which by the way the courts are very against\nAbortion or relationships of any kind whether it's like a like a business contract where you're supposed to work for somebody very unlikely if they know there's got to be an awkward or straight relationship there\nThey usually are not inclined to have that happen so just for no other reason than to protect the drama from the school at the force the coach to then have to you know have the kid there I I Would be shocked if they if they have that go forward even for the last couple of games with the season but no this\nIs high school and I'm saying nothing I don't know this coach I don't know his sister but one of the allegations was that\nYou know he allowed kids on the team who had attended his private soccer camp oh they're paid money and now not every kid who went to the capital of the team and there were seven people who made the team that had knocked out to the care\nBut that is one of the allegations that you know they sort of you know they pay to being struck by him now on the other side I think he can say oh I Know this voice really well I Do their talents I Know how they received coaching\nAnd you know it had nothing to do with a little bit of money they pay to be another cat but ... does make a difference and you know high school sports does have a political component to it\nIt's great to be the manager when every ... every move you poll work yeah it's great to be the manager [noise] he used the same set of um decision making\nProcess to seize process I ...\nProcess tightening being near ... during the use the same you use those same sort of a rules which you know you'd governs the way you make decisions and it doesn't work out ... and then you know little things you say well what's that well you know you missed by a game or two\nYou know using a relief pitcher in game when you see when you say air quotes didn't need to and then he's not available the next day and you really could use a little things like that old and the guy back\nMaybe he should have been in the lineup because he's a better off offensive player just little things like that and so here here some of the questions I have a\nAnd this I think is the biggest for this ball club and it's up to the media and fans to hold the brass feet to the fire we've ever had a breast foot that can get really hot and happy than have a talent evaluation\nGotta have it and here I'm going to give you a big picture but it goes down even the smaller ... smallest things they traded for damage goods in Marcello sooner and my very first off and let the brewers trade for a guy who just about one yellow triple crown Christian yell at ... yeah [noise]\nYeah and in addition what are you really need in that line up a powerful left handed bat hitting the middle of the order now there are reasons and I get it and certainly his performance this year makes it sound like you know I'm a results oriented thinking\nThere is some of that but really knowledgeable people like the cardinals be writer for the post dispatch going back literally a year Derek Gould in print was championing\nYell at his ability and how we would fit but the argument and so so that's there and then you've got people famine void in ...\nDid they make the right decisions on those guys I think for the most part yes but I think those are worth looking at you have the three but your three best hitters in your light up or your three worst offenders and we all complained about the office and the defense what do you do I don't know I'm just throwing out the questions\nAnd then what direction do you go\nMy opinion you have to have one of the top two free agents Bryce Harper or many Machado I Wish you'd get both but that's\nNot reality not realistic it all got to have one okay ... so let me throw a question of you know this team as it ends its season uh\nWould you trust it to begin next to you know you\nDon't have as much talent as the brewers as the Braves as the cubs says the Dodgers as the Rockies and despite the way they went splat maybe even the ... yeah certainly offensively so you don't have as much talent as those other teams\nI Would agree with you but it's going to be some a tough decisions made over the ... and let's make the worst even worse her car rides okay Ryder Cup all\nMay I just say oh no matter how you before the first of all our colleague from across the aisle [laughter]\nLet let me just say this okay I'm going to sum up the Ryder Cup in\nA a a forwards tailor made twist face a tailor made twist\nRace okay now the reason I say that is because if you watch the Ryder Cup\nTiger Woods big commercial Tiger Woods has no he's with Nike but I'm not doing like he doesn't do golf clubs anymore they got out of that business tailor made is one of the preeminent no club makers\nAnd they have a new driver called a that it has a technology called twist ... rifles yes so you're you're you're ... allegedly your misfits come back to center I mean that's the old you know okay so you know for an amateur that's pretty cool thing art\nSo every thirty minutes supposed commercials on okay Tiger Woods was over\nOver right what do we call knock knock who's there Owen Owen who ... for um\nOkay so that that you know and so he's promoting this and every one of those guys every time they come back from this twist based commercial your most hits or they're hitting him in a quiet they're hitting him over buildings that are written beep oh\nWe just could not get anything it was an embarrassment to the right good luck to\nYou because remember we talked about what a great way just to finish their comeback season no question said it was like what do what ever reason tiger just doesn't sell in that format dope\nStill were they just tired or any American overwhelmed with jet lag what was the deal\nOr no I was just they they haven't won over there in the last nine tries you know some guys go early you wouldn't think no I don't think it is but it but I'll tell you this and I said this the moment pure picked him by Phil Mickelson was the wrong choice\nIt's his last writer I'd say that I did say that and and not that you know whomever he would've picked to ... you know for oil has to make the different ones are enough but who knows um yeah ... terrible a\nPlayoff baseball although it's technically game one sixty three of the regular seasons of yours beat the cubs today at Wrigley Field all this survey we a division they go to LA or know they'll\nThey'll they'll whoever loses the Colorado Dodger games and write how Colorado's lives in ... Colorado would go to Wrigley Field\nI always know how it is okay so the cubs don't have to I guess confusing I honor\nYeah I I think they'll host the Rockies if the Rockies which I\nSaid so I was\nOne game for for for that'll be the official wildcard okay\n... and the other team close division so let's say let's go judges Rogers was okay for you for his\n... who will be the world\nChampion [noise]\n... who will be the world series champions [noise] Astros T shirts and\nI was going to say them or so I'll take the or Red Sox\nOkay All right I think the Astros better you\nHurting here and I'll take the red Sox All right now having said that\nAny of the four teams playing today they're they're scratching call and you get in writing I think any one of the four of them to get in World Series I really do\nThe first time since oh nine there's been a tied to top division it's pretty interesting that so we got it right you\nKnow or anything else oh college football\nWas who didn't play but a game of interest in the Southeastern Conference Kentucky Beach South Carolina on the road show at South Carolina twenty four and five and no one ranked seventeenth they had\nWas will host Kentucky on the twenty sixth of this month and a Missouri we'll go to South Carolina this coming Saturday\nOne last note I thought it was great um if you have to go on line to see this video but it's it's everywhere I'm\nIn the game Sunday there was a home run by John Carlos ... or somebody like John ... car law that's how I call a guy John Carlos ...
