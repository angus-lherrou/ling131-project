gonna say um that was even more wild when you think about space we actually get pictures high def pictures from Mars you ever watch or even look at some of those pictures that we get another planet sure sorry I didn't mean that I mean if you believe in all that stuff once again I have a job at a\nTime I had the one I have is a film that was directed by a guy named Douglas Trumbull who did a lot of the special effects for great space movies like two thousand one he worked on the first Star Wars and up [noise] she did a film [noise] excuse me a with Bruce Stern\nIn the lead role called silent running because sort of this it was in the mid seventies\nI thought that was the uh sledding movies so silent\nRunning is this post apocalyptic movie where there's no more plant life on earth and so we're looking for different planets where we can terra form or the planet and so she is\nShe's alone on this ship and he has built some robots to keep him company and again very melancholy very you know slow moving a film a but the thing that I read ... remember from watching it when I was a kid is it the three robots are named Huey Dewey and Louie\nThat's not exactly which\nIs pretty cute I it definitely has a a sort of a Sater ending but Tyler running is a good sort of science fiction kind of reminds me of ah what are the Matt Damon a martial martial arts or do they call it that was a bit more rousing crowd pleaser Seattle is the entire\nRun against not yeah I'm a an another film that um this one's a little walk you to talk about now because Kevin Spacey voices a computer\nAnd so at the time I was like wow what great casting Kevin Spacey way now my I Wish they could read the other way because of a former navy why would I Do they could but it's a film starring us Iraq well that was directed by David Bowie son Duncan Jones stretch the so called moon\nAnd it is streaming I think it's on Netflix right now and uh this is about a guy played by Sam Rockwell who is working alone on the moon is doing some sort of\nA deal for for the you know for NASA or whatever NASA is in the future and he's sending them back tapes but he's alone and he's certainly just starts to go batty and uh that his replacement shows up\nAnd I don't want to say anything more than that but it's called moon\nAnd it is really really wonderful ... won best supporting actor last year for three billboards outside ebbing Missouri and if you haven't watched a lot of his stuff he's really wonderful and the smell of what what year was that a moon I Want to say it was about a two thousand five maybe six\nOr something around there it's really really wonderful part here is a film that nobody remembers except me and\nIt was from the early eighties I had I had coloring books I read comic books\nAnd uh I ... I think ... when I was about six or seven of this film it was a Disney film\nThat didn't make any money at all and it was going to be the you know their Star Wars before they just bought Star Wars or it but it was sort of a a darker kids' film like a lot of things in the eighties and the kind of went to the realm of a of a twenty thousand leagues where the captain Nemo type character it was called the\nBlack hole I think I cite yeah I think I did read adults [noise]\nIt's like our HR department here [laughter] ... yes because it doesn't exist in the black hole it was\nUm I don't even know if I can give a good synopsis of the story but it was basically these are people who are picked up a ... they were stranded in the middle of space and this other ship a fix them up and then things do not go well at all there was this\nOminous giant red robot that had like ... sauce for hand the sort of scared me when I was a kid but the name of the robot Maximilian\nThat it was really I had ...\nMillion pajamas and anyway the black hole really great kind of hard movie to find a bunch of them are really wonderful Disney film and that really messed up and they\nAre and then finally it because I have to do a horror film whenever we do the Sacramento or every week 'cause I Love the honor of horror movies I have talked about the film that I thought I was going to really dislike that I was going to hate this movie I went to see it when I was living in Nashville\nI went to see it when it was released in theaters about Nineteen Ninety seven with a friend of mine and we went to go make fun of it we thought OK will drop our ten bucks and go and make fun of this I thought it would look at it looked like a alien rip off\nAnd it was not at all the film that I thought it was going to be um about halfway through it changes the genre in from a science fiction film to us straight horror film and I loved it it's a film star exam Neal and Laurence Fishburne it's called if it horizon\nEvent horizon event horizon oh never heard of it well again if you watch the trailer it looks like a an alien rip off sure and the trailers not very good but that's not what the film is at all Sam Neal who was great drastic park is great and\nIn the mouth demand is really really great actor from a New Zealand I think and a boy this movie it just changes on a dime and it it's a wonderful really really yeah so even horizon is a really great horror film if you like being scared that is given I did get streaming on Amazon right now\nAre good at it the cat from outer space to make the list or didn't\nMake a list and I asked him at the\nMovie you went from ... the one of the alien ... you know it's wrong to have a call ... ... ... ...\n... and ... and it was crazy\nOh my God I enjoy

of the main guy from go right to the horse's mouth right hand or [noise] you know Jim is a\nTerrific [noise] St Louis in and a given back he's in his nature\nAnd um the success they've had with their company worldwide technologies um and it shows the way they built up sport is soccer but also a ... and uh it's such a great company a great guy and it fits perfectly with the Taylor genetic right sure and\nAnd the really brilliant thing is that it is a\nA going to be a woman on franchise and run franchise which I think is a and not because we're in the hash tag meat to era not that good but because of the ... it's time it really I think it's time\nAnd so I'm very pleased about that and I'm happy that uh our city is going to be getting a hopefully because we got\nGood I was young I'm putting the horse way I'd have to lock down on that front of us are I Do is soccer first thing every day\nAll right sounds good but um you know it's a it's a it's a longer process so we'll hopefully no but I think we're on the top of the list for the MLS guys because they know about St Louis in the mid west being a grave\nAll they've always wanted a franchise in to our detriment we've never been able to get our act together yeah on a couple of different levels and now that appears we\nHave that it should be\nI Will call it a slam dunk but perhaps of layoffs but yeah you know what the other cities that are uh forbid the Phoenix Vegas San Diego Lou ...\n... men it'll look like they're all ... so we got it for sure like to be a soccer player in Phoenix or games are outdoors in August\nIt's a balmy one forcing here but\nIt's an ... I I think those are most of them and I might have added some facts cities in there I don't know um uh but I think because of the strengthening ownership group the strength of the history of soccer in the town the fact that\nThey don't need public money to build that side of downtown state I was most important ... mandates now and that they can they do fill all those blocks\nAnd\nI think they do get extra credit for having female ownership\nThat's going to say I think there's a lot of strength air and soccer moms I have kids and I thought ... highly laugh I Would ask that question yesterday that laid out a cat and we don't know\nIf we've got a team they bring down orange slice juice during the day they were ... just by hand of every\nShow where do you know oh it's okay it'll be okay

the next to last\n... last home game no no this was at it because of a of a game that got weather doubt while back but it's really really\nImportant if she needs a four points in the next two games to control their own destiny to be in the playoffs for the first time in their existence so they're Tulsa tonight and I could use some fans\nYeah it'll it'll be it'll be a great crowd don't don't let that deter you will find a place for you to set to come on out it's going to be great in what I Love about the game the presentation of singles hep C is um\nSomething for everybody there's a great area for families there's a great area if you're completely insane [laughter] there's there's there's your for your hand of in between I Want to socialize a little bit they're literally something for everybody at the game anyway more importantly on the pitch\nThree points for when they need for to walk down\nA playoff spot so a draw is only one point and that would mean oh brother we had we landed right get to three tonight it takes a lot of the pressure off your shoes me if you do get even appoint tonight now you're not in control your own destiny doesn't mean you're out\nBut then it matters what other teen us do if you can get four points in the next two games you're and sounds like a math problem\nAnd that's why I have to go over and write it all down to central question about so well

to each other about our teams by each other beers though throughout have beers after the end of the day it it's it's great\nYou know St Louis is love Wrigley Field Chicagoans love coming down it's it's all good Yankees Red Sox that's a little different story like\nRed Sox and to another one that's better I Know LA LA just Francisco that was actually Banderas shit is dangerous terrible that is absolutely terrible and you know I always said that\nActually Banderas it is dangerous terrible that is absolutely terrible and you know I always said that the you know one of the of the great things
