there was talk in the beginning that they were going to do it in prime time which man stomach would take place in the evenings ... it would be evening golf which is why I I assume they were not considering selling tickets but it's not going to be at night and that's not the reason so\nThat you know I'm sure it'll be a few sponsors and the people we got to take the cameras and cover the event the broadcasters and all that but that's a that's the plan so I'm excited about it I think it's going to be a cool thing I got a story about\nSomething that may save your life that you can get your hands on planes and what it may save your life but I'm not going to do that one\nYet [laughter] that'd be good to\nKnow this was much more important can evolve that I'm living in who if it weren't for him and his band and five and a show of effort a top forty stations which I'm like this because\nEvery other show on the radio or you can just go from one station to the other to the other and you're going to hear at I mean yeah he's like on every show\nIt can to the other to the other and you're going to hear I mean yeah\nHe's like I remember the show he's on the voice\nMy kids like to watch your voice my wife my wife likes to watch it was St Louis represented where the young lady on the voice so there's a little added interest in the area\nI'm In I read something that I didn't really want to read now that I Know and it's one of those things where we'll give you an example\nOn our show every time I see a wildly wildly popular or something wildly this Josh we'll do a really poor impression on me [noise] um\nWhere he says while plate [laughter] after I said so now I'll be out in the pouch somewhere talking to my wife for something\nAnd I will say oh you know and that looks wildly interesting and the little boy's man we'll hear Josh bono sang wildly chilies really wildly for me to have a new word should I'm self conscious about it\nLike sometimes I I don't make it a drinking game 'cause that'd be hammered every time a guy says you know\nUm did you ever catch the butler county times guy says you know\nGets a new game I Do it's you you know we all have crutches but once you get somebody else's crotch it's all you can hear guy does a lot of us as well while the the eyes\nIs very typical because the brain wants to fill the space with noise sure\nI used to get in trouble for us when I was in first grade our ... to get mad at\nEach other for us but that was usually during sex [laughter] is this one it is and I don't know I got in trouble because nobody was there um anyway [noise] wildly wildly so here's the thing I didn't\nWant to know and is now screwed up everything for me on the voice mhm I saw a story today and they showed a bunch of pictures\nThat and he's been on the show since the beginning I think and I'm living right mhm since the very beginning and he's been one of the coaches on the voice and if you don't watch the show you got the judges in the chairs that spin around\nAnd there's a button on the front of the chair and if you hit the button your chair turns around and you want to get that person to be on your team\nAt a movie in all ways ... the same way on the chair where he's got his foot up on the podium in front of it and this and I and I\nAnd I watch some videos oh yeah and in every scene where Adam is sitting in his judge chair on the voice he's got his leg up like you know if you work somebody else's house or if that was your kid you smack them and only get to put your foot couch\nRobert you put that foot down\nSo do you think that they just keep using the same\nFootage lane as the other oh can you don't bleacher hairdo you know and so now I can enjoy the voice for the musical contest that it is I Will watch the show going she not ever going to put that leg down\nMaybe it's his way of trying to stay kind of like rebellious and young and hits because you know I mean you don't want us to like an old man on their whenever you're trying to appeal to the younger demo I suppose\nBut I'm just dying maybe he's trying to talk to somebody a friend who knows is watching the show kind of like you know Carol Burnett used to pull her ear every show yeah but you wouldn't set her ear on the desk for the whole show I don't know really there isn't long said she's trying to share\nCarol what's wrong or do you just get blonde or by the minute or so now when you watch ... I'm Sorry I read it for you but if I don't get to enjoy it you don't get to enjoy their Ari here's the thing that will save your life okay okay this is if if you take nothing else away from the show\nThere is a hospital New York Presbyterian Hospital [noise]\nUh has created a playlist on Spotify and they share it on Twitter and it might not be a bad thing for you to download an app available because every song and there's a lot of fight play list\nHas that one hundred ... pm thing\nOh oh oh for staying alive staying alive keep your right I\nI Would start at staying alive to that story came out a while ago that if you were giving CPR to somebody and you did it to the beat of staying alive they would also [laughter]\nScale unless you have no sense of rhythm and you kill somebody but there's other songs dancing queen by a bus spirit in the sky by Norman Green bomb if someone older so having a heart attack [laughter] or someone older as a minister envy\nBut but that's kind of a you know other kinds of not been well for the person receiving the CPR true spirit in this guy I mean\nWell if they don't have it's all over now on the list true uh sorry by Justin Bieber is also on there there are forty songs all told a closer by the chain smokers\nWeird um but all of those have that hundred beats per minute thing that if you listen to those while you're giving CPR or the recipient as a better chance of making it\nShe tried out sometime daring weather down there and that's what we call the public service [laughter] you know I was still aired we ever get\nTo know what to master the rain\nYou know what if there wasn't any traffic what would you be doing for a living\nA boy that's a good question or be said for we stuck on the roads yeah well I always say there's a job security\nAnd you know what's funny is it's not it we've got nasty weather out there the roads aren't near as bad as they were when it was great this week you know it's been a nightmare but yeah right now\nOh let's see where do I start they've got an accent on west bound highway Seventy just under the museum veterans bridge to write wanes or block their butt trap expect all the way up to south on highway or to North bound fifty five\nAlso underneath the popular Street Bridge or just passed that in a depressed section you've got an X. block in the left lane\nYou had an accent that had the highway shut down on west ... Seventy of Brian road that's been reopened but traffic is still jammed up from Seventy nine\nOut through like St Louis boulevard now south up to Seventy is jammed up from North of page down through

that they check a lot of our boxes on both sides so that's where that process starts and we have nine currently that we\nWork with do you have a chance to you guys race front stoop 'cause I'm In an interesting position uh my my foundation is a foundation we raise money for charities right we are not a charity we we get the money in the attention for them\nAnd then give them the money sometimes it's hard for corporate America to understand but it's like well why don't we just\nGive the St Louis crisis nursery to check instead of giving it to one of our partners for their one of a one of mine to X ray [laughter] so uh yeah ... yeah right here\nBut I Would talk about about that aspect of it when you've got a corporation or something like that where it's a little difficult to define\nOn raising those funds I on raising the funds that island yeah so we set up the business donations says that it's a monthly donation at the business makes it so it's not a part of each sale it's not for every customer it's not an accounting nightmare anything like that that business decides on a comfortable donation amount that they can make to say the crisis nursery\nThey know that they can get every single month whether they have a good month and sales or badminton sales so\nThey never have to stop there getting for financial reasons and organizations like the crisis nursery can depend on that business as a monthly donor which is like the holy grail of fundraising a donor that you don't have to keep asking for donations\nTo raise funds to or we do not know John that yes quarterly event though uh yeah so\nWe actually provide events for our members so again as the businesses are our business owners are running their business they don't have time to get their staff out to volunteer which is a great team building exercising great for the company culture so we actually plan and organize advance every single quarter for our business owners their staff and their family members to come out\nTo volunteer together to have that team building exercise to get the kids involved but also to meet all of the other fifty plus businesses that are in are getting these real community so now they can network now they can work together it's becoming a almost a networking group in its own because now they're connected to this common bond of good news world and giving back\nIs there a limit to the number of charitable organizations you'll take on\nA so as we grow we were able to take on more but for every nonprofit we work with them we have to cure it and all the social media content to get to the businesses that is one of the tools we provide we have to have inventory for all the brand new materials that we treat for each nonprofit there'd be they give to the uh\nBusinesses so uh we do only have nine on board right now but as we grow that number will grow as well\nAnd again we're attacking ... founder of good meets world and can you tell her ... you know more about the impact that you had seen what you've done that the community\nYeah absolutely so ah it's it it's been a wild ride so far we're about a year and a half into this we just released or new model about four months ago we've reached fifty businesses are in the service and we just say a hundred thousand dollars in donations to local St Louis nonprofits and it's not just that impact for the non profits but it's also the impact for the businesses\nWe have businesses that are putting the nonprofit logos and are we get certification and our email signatures and getting customers or potential customers that are saying hey this is incredible I Know straight rescue I get my my rescues from there I Want to do business with you or how can my family get involved it's just that added extra bonus to help grow your business as\nWell do you take a look at the types of charities that yeah I was like well we got nine of our fourteen of her children what are we doing for veterans what are we doing elderly what are we doing for animals I mean is there an effort to kind of balance that all it's all so we\nOnly have one non profit per cause whether it's sick children the environment and military families are rescued animals whatever happens to be we have nine different sections that people tend to get to the most in the United states and that's how we have that split up\nOkay [laughter] interesting

awareness month or for those in the no\nIt's ... ... which is why they call it national cyber security awareness my ... and everybody just makes people are crazy [laughter] [noise] um it used to be\nThat if you got online you could possibly get in trouble [noise]\nSomebody might find something where they can hacking and find a weakness in your fire wall now if you don't have to buy a new computer and you bring it home and your plug it in if you don't already have all that stuff in place within two minutes\nNot even probably there will be some kind of virus on your computer each insane I'm going back to pen and paper Randy I Know that's not good for business but I'm scared how does everyone gets so nasty and how did they get so tech savvy to do such stakes hire 'em\nEither way usually falls upon the end user which is you know everyday mom and pop you me daughter son you know whoever gets on the Internet and it's just just it's\nBeing educated simple things and we're talking about email security specifically to day in and I have a state may you know you're not expecting that don't click on it don't open it ... if you get an email from grandma per se in some weird attached\nManaged to let you go you know I got a question if you're not expecting something question it but I heard that some of the stuff that can wreak havoc in your computer is in the body of the email now you don't even have to open an attachment is that true 'cause that's fine\nIt's a little more challenging but possible there's the ideology of um it's called speaking I'm basically I'm gonna send you an email today but it's actually not from me and I didn't send it but it's like hey open this up I got really something really cool free to check out right you know things to look for\nMisspelled words you know are you are expecting something from me or you know oh I Know Randy I trust him and click on it but really in the day\nDid it come from me sell things to look out for is that address address you're expecting it to be from are you expecting it so it could be as simple as a Pdf file or a picture which is you know PDF files a word or kind of like a word document a document they can embed information in there that can wreak havoc on your system\nI sign up for every kind of reward coupon program there is so I get tons of you know actually right now and this is embarrassing kidnapped I finally have like Fifteen thousand emails while that was sad but it's true I mean I get kinds yeah I mean I get tons of it's actually sixteen thousand one hundred ...\nI got five hundred any I'll say stop being so mean to share [laughter] she's\nA fan favorite job with the coupons I mean you know you're going to get down from say you know Marshall or Michael's or whoever you expect them but is there a way to know if they've been hacked right away if you don't get something else from then\nIt's not necessarily that they've been hacked what's happening is you're signing up for this\nFree information guy who's to say they're not going to take the information you just gave 'em your email and sell it to some advertising ABC oh this person likes to sign up for free things some boom now you're on this list and they sold it and they sold it and they sold the so now you're on a hundred people's lists\nAnd then down the road next thing you know you got Fifteen thousand emails every day coming flying that you know promotions because you signed up for its overload\nSo ready is there a way to keep companies accountable and I mean I'm sure this is like out of our pay grade but I mean is there a way for the government to kind of to say you would sign up and and this is completely false but you know are in bed bath and beyond Oh yes and\nI'm not accusing them of this but let's just say they want to sell it off could that company bed bath and beyond in theory didn't get in trouble for selling off information that you gave them\nA you know what the expectation that they would not sell it\nI'm not familiar with America's policy on that I have friends that work and in sales and marketing um agencies or internationally and there is legislation and laws passed that if your\nRecipient hasn't specifically express they want you received the email you can email mutts against the law and you can be fined for it\nWhy don't we go back for a minute Matt being on bed bath and beyond\nI'll get married [laughter]\nJohn long you been down this road a couple of times from what I understand what the whole marriage thing right is that where you get your bath beads or no I get those that your body or he knows the stuff I have my places okay how do you hear on the half life I think I had to stop the wheels of progress you're right and what\nPlay\nLike here's where the ...\nThe little\nGuy\nRamsey jobs back on Monday along the ... just a little while but\nFinally went in the wind down to the blues last night\nOr get ever Bonnie how we're doing\nNow you\nAre correct analysis of the blues is that on the on the games are insightful in my part burger question about it one five three um it was a much\nBetter game doctors because we're the results of the things they were doing terribly\nThe first two games worked out much better this time I'm David Peron and your third ... with the blues had a hat trick that with a lot of fun cake Allen who had been I'm certainly under the microscope a more solid perhaps not great so not perhaps\nWe don't need the soft sell things here on this show do we know that you know he'd been bad and he would salad so that's an improvement and um so you know all in all things I think with a much much better and then I'm not the day off 'cause they traveled to Chicago and we'll take on the black hawk for\nEarly rematch\nSeems weird that we've got you know you can count all the blues games on one hand they were already playing the same team again it's there are ...\nWherever they I think that maybe have contracts with the leading a little bit so at least fourteen over and over and over again um\n... yeah it is weird didn't they stack them up this way and you know your first three games or at home now you go on the road it shares a lot of it has to do with building availability down the road and they have to get very boring but it's a very detailed\nVery boring so I'm Glad you brought it up or

T. R. S. [noise]\nOff the answering machine you show your diversity I'm trying to sound a little hard core nowadays you know you're working on junk yard\nWill be back on the moon day\nAnd I'll and I'll go back to mind saying some new industry next week on our show burning singer go uh\nNHL hall of famers who will be with us or as we'll adjusting beep and then I Can't begin to tell you my excitement about that 'cause I Love just to be\nAll right let's let's talk about the Iraqi Michael and we knew he was going to hit hard and we finally narrowed it down to an area\nAround the animosity beach to the point where they had a mandatory evacuation you in a town called Mexico City and that's really the part of the country where a lot of St Louis didn't go to vacation yet very few of us here have never even heard of Mexico City Florida\nAnd now it out on stage acting as devastating Michael hitting land a and I bought a hundred and fifty five\nMiles per hour ... covering it for ABC to bring us up to speed with the latest I Can't imagine beat that authorities had any idea that you would find does stained wins dashed high\nWas especially in that area of Florida which has never seen a storm of that magnitude in fact honestly last storm of this magnitude came through in Nineteen sixty nine almost a half century ago it was hurricane Camille this was one of the third most powerful storm ever to hit the United states\nToday I had a chance to fly over with the United states coast guard to fly over Mexico beach and Callaway and Panama City and really get a sense\nOf the big picture perspective of what happened here when I saw it specially in Mexico beach which you mentioned just a moment ago I saw\nHomes that were so completely wiped off the face of this or that wasn't even any ... breed joined a case where did they used to be just a foundation just a concrete slab the devastation was so remarkable the question came up in my mind and the mind of the helicopter crew\nOut of the world and he would have survived this people do survive but on the flipside of that to be honest with you that we're going to find that more people are missing and perhaps or people are dead before this was all over\nWe saw numbers turned around you that it was three than it was the lead and and I think the latest ... rate on this\nIs Thirteen and one of the most distracting things about all of this is there's a fair amount of remote areas where she had\nNo cell service no electricity so no way to account for their seeing literally thousands of people so they expect those numbers to go significantly higher on the the county's job day\nThat's exactly right and not only are we talking about remote areas of the Florida Panhandle and I could I could tell you're from looking at this\nFrom a from above for about five hundred feet and make a coast guard helicopter I mean these are small communities where this\nHurricane hits it took a right turn and at the very last moment it was aiming right out out of our city with thousands of people have made a right turn and we took away and Mexico beach where there'd be a total of Fifteen hundred to three thousand people altogether\nWho live there many of those people as you said evacuated a lot of people however steak and the question is\nHow many who we don't know about the cell phones in this area are still out there that work is down so you don't know if you can't read someone you don't know if it's because they're not answering the phone because the phone doesn't work or God Forbid because something terrible has happened to them and they'll never answer the phone and get\nThe storm has passed in leads to the point now where some rescuers can come in and supplies can be brought in ... and ... can come to the rescue or what are we hearing from those people\nAnd then some help can come to the rescue or what are we hearing from those people are they still in the process of trying to get in these areas because these thoroughfares although they're not six lane roads there is still one or two lane roads are covered with trees\nExactly in the case of the major artery is here what's happened is the military and civilian authorities have gone through with heavy equipment to push the debris literally push that a break out of the way off the side of the road landed up later let's just create a way for emergency workers to get in and out\nNow that's what's going on right now you you might be having some trouble hearing they still have cell service Skype connection so if we're if we're a little sketchy that's what's going on right now\nThe other thing is that those roads the secondary rode the residential areas they're still completely covered with down trees with the breed downed power lines broken power all it's just going to take a long time to get in there because really you have to cut your way in touch with your house\nAnd for the downed trees that are in the house she has anybody there to help they are and then go to the next house and I'm telling you this is just going to take days and days without which\nWas that was that was kind of my next question Peter I'm sure it'd be hard to tell but I mean has there been any indication from authorities on when people can start heading back down and you know check out the property to see if there's any damage or cause that last I heard people were being urged to not come back home\nThey're being urged not to come back home being told to stay away so a lot of people are coming back which adds to some of the problems that they have here in the immediate traffic congestion realm and also the fact that these people are coming in putting more than bans on services that are already stretched to the ...\nIf someone like that gets hurt well the hospitals are already ... inch\nShipping patients out right now you know the patients who need help the most uh you're right this is going to be a long long duration event and the people who are coming back or making it any easier there in fact a lot of people would say they're prolonging this of\nHurricane hurricane Michael a\nDefining a lot of logic um these storms aren't supposed to hit land in a hundred and fifty five miles an hour they're not supposed to get where they did and it's been almost a half century since we saw that\nKind of hurricane hit that area they also are supposed to travel in the very far and this is another area that's a little different that he didn't just smack coastline but he came in and kept a lot of experience strength up as it did", "show_name": "Large Morning Show in
