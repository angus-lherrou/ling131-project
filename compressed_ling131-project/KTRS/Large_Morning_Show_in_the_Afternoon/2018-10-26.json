now how your chair and make the second half are really good I think it's I think it's an interesting point honestly\nI Would agree with you uh one of the things that I look at it in this game is a who the um the teams are playing in the future and George is coming to Lexington to play I'm a ... against the Wildcats\nThey may be focused more on that game coming up than they are a with a zoo now they're ... you know were favored [noise] they're not gonna like that stepping on to our turf but I think it's going to be closer than a touchdown Bob and I'm going to give me my score right now I think we got a a more powerful off ... and they do defenses I if\nI really couldn't do it it's a toss up I think but uh I I've gotten a zoo not covering winning the game twenty seven twenty three [noise]\n\nI don't like which really is I think about a couple of shows I think something like twenty eight\nSo it's going to be a higher scoring game you think\nI I Do and the um\nDo I think and um

[noise]\nRight away to a\nReceiver Gomez and I'm Steve welcome back to the show thank you so much for coming on again Oh thank you for having All right so a federal law enforcement officials named this guy you want to tell us who he is and maybe or if you know what ah what was his motives\n[noise] well a perfect is these are they are um right now I don't think we still know too much about his motive and we do know that incredible criminal history we also know in two thousand two\nHe had made a bomb threat against a utility company and after it gets it you know the problems with him and he was very threatening from what it sounds like a record so I'm not a you know shy about being threatened and it'd be violent\nSo uh and and we also heard that he apparently was on the radar because he made some threats to um [noise]\nThe the congresswoman Watchmen show\nYes on ... so he clearly has some issues whether it's just these these violent weather is meant to help issue is something that is going to be scored a lot further in the investigation\nUp but I'm sure they're going to dig into this guy pretty hard of it but didn't have also some domestic violence in his past\nThe issues that barely or with this white\nUm I think are just you know recently they had a they got divorced or separated so now you get you get that going on\nThey're going to be looking at those types of issues issues with family members or in his life that they have been the trigger that would have been the straw that broke the camel's back and and and got him to uh become more violent than an act out on whoever he thought was a you know against them and and that that might have been nice to\nBe a democratic politicians\nAnd eh and activists that he thought he needed to act against that and that that might be the motive that might have been what a cause\nSteve I Want to know more about this\nYeah motive that might have been what caused\nThis Steve I Want to know more about this now I'm hearing at maybe ... pretty much the story is right there on the ban it\nMight be absolutely I I saw those stickers I think everybody's seen those stickers and you've got to say to yourself [noise]\nWhat kind of person has stickers like that and and ah you know that there are clearly he had his political beliefs in ideology [noise] and ah and then you know if you get your vote that ideology it again\nYou know the ideology and and political positioning of the of the individuals he ... the uh the the devices to so ... ... it it gets a somewhat of an indicator as what the possible motive is um I don't want to say\nThat that is the motive but uh but you know we we have at least an idea now and and that's usually the case went to ... is arrested in eastern diving into their life it'll start to become clear and fortunate when you don't have a suspect\nUm you know we're we're kind of walking in the dark and and all you're doing is they're going after you know after ... after clue but boy getting that that fingerprint or from the lab a that was just amazing just amazing work by all law enforcement in this case you\nKnow there's ... it's almost as fast as a television show seriously uh you know you think of all the people is you know it did they go home down to this guy\nAnd and find them with the you just like they did it was just it it almost sensational and with from the time we talked yesterday I thought well this is going to be a long haul here but they focused on Florida and tell us how the ... you know exactly zeroed in on this guy named him\nWell they\nProbably knew that South Florida was at least a starting point because the packages had the return address of a congressman congresswoman or watch the show\nAnd and uh you know her office there now it wasn't for her office there was just you know of that an average is down there but they have to think okay that these packages were being dropped in the mail system somewhere in South Florida\nAnd so that was the starting point of it sounds like once they got the fingerprint and the and the DNA\nFrom the packages or the other one package from a that was sent to a congresswoman Maxine Waters that at that point they were able to identify who he was and then you know from there you got to be checked you run the name of the system and so on and that and it pretty fast because\nYou know especially when somebody has a criminal history that interested before there's a lot that you know about a person inside a database when they've been arrested so then they were able to trace it back to you know ... where he was down to South Florida the hook for own that comes back to him they find it now they're able to track it the big bang moment you you're you're off to the races when it comes to the investigation\nThat has been pretty exciting for ah the those of you real\nAbsolutely I've been involved in cases like this where you basically say look we're going to move heaven and earth\nWe're going to solve this case as fast as possible because when you when you get the Medicaid as a priority case you're pretty much are going to be doing whatever you have to do the resources are going to be there for you that everybody's going to be running full\nSpeed up the biggest challenges that you don't want people to tire out particular going to be willing to work twenty four seven and you get time to go home\nBut up but in this case you know it it is kind of like a a case similar to the show twenty four I've been involved in cases like that where you know you saw the case in like two to three days because everybody's working twenty four seven and when you're when you're done you're like wow that that was like a movie who\nDoesn't happen like that every day we spend a lot worse but I'll tell you it\nDoesn't inducing this wasn't the most savvy of criminals in in the air go gee maybe a candidate for some sort of\nYou know defense um mental defense because the guy just I I don't know you ... it\nThe way he went about this was just really sort of book crude but but let's talk about justice and then we'll let you go because I Know you've got some other um uh interviews today but what about justice for this guy will be swift will be harsh are we going to make a a a a lesson out of this guy\nI think they are I think it's going to be swept can be harsh they're going to throw the book at him every charge that can be pulled together based on the evidence is going to be filed against this individual [noise] um and they yes they ... they want to send a message I mean they do not want\nPeople especially Americans to be trying to influence our political system because at the end of the day you know ... where these explosive devices and people could have been hurt\nBut the big message is with regard to what it could do to our political system in the political agenda we can't have that in this country I mean we have to be able to not be influenced by fear and intimidation and a threat of violence\nYou know as we're considering I'm going to the polls and and and boating on on either one one candidate or one side of the other I mean you know that can't be part of this process and so I think they're going to really go after him as far as charges it and make sure that they send a message to anybody out there that thinking about the same thing\nSteve you've done a great job a kudos to the law enforcement people that you know it really was remarkable and give us some really good information I Hope we can talk to again soon\nGreat anytime aren't\nGoing to have a good weekend is guy in Sherry here highly word is coming up for you it's five twenty nine and the big five fifty\nDid you see the Daily Stormer story that totally kid is right now there was some guy that what what
