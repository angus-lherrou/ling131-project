they were wearing\nAnd yet\nSo I'm going to backtrack a little bit but we know that bumble is up for the most part recognized as a dating app but recently it's increased it reached to promote women or to find friendships across the country as well as networking and so I'm\nIn an effort to kind of make sure that people across the country understand these different capacities they have now hired a different\nPeople to execute events that reflect those scenes business and friendship and so next week we're hosting any jak called um how creative dynamic women balance career in life and Laura gr is going to be one of our panelists and so what\nWas it was when I reached out to her she's like\nA ball and um I probably felt a joke like that and\nUm and so yeah I think that's why I'm here to to to

[noise] kind of an interesting thing that happened to president\nOr this morning ... tweeted that does that a\nDemocratic Party leaders are doing little to stop the flow of ... people across the southern border including many criminals\nOr I don't know if that's rhetoric or you know if that's just the way he um he wants to do it but um and Matt I lost my top shoot you were on Harris boys thank you very much okay\nJust wanna make sure we're okay from Washington All right sorry about that anti I was totally unprepared for you but thanks for coming on the show appreciate it let's talk\nThat makes [laughter]\nHello bigger that so so let's talk about this uh uh we know that there are ah you know somewhere I've heard different numbers between two and four thousand people\nThe Hondurans that are making their way through on tour is over the border into Mexico or maybe some people are coming up through believes going northern routes I don't know\nI'm at this obviously is a problem\nCaravan reaches the border here [noise] um\nThe problem it to this caravan reaches the border here [noise] um what are what is what's the country or what does the government trying to do to stay in the last\nWell let's get back to work or to Mrs Clinton Trump is very upset\nAbout that or\nAny immigrants are coming over the border illegally and correct doesn't seem to be particularly thrilled about the ones that are coming illegally but when he's what he did was uh he issued a statement saying that\nUh he threatened to close the U.S Mexico border frightening to cut off a financial aid Central American countries and he even said you know he's willing to blow up the U.S Mexico trade you just made if Mexico doesn't do something to stop people from coming now if you look at a map bears Honduras\nGuatemala and Mexico so Mexico loaded up two plane loads of police to seven twenty seven Boeing jets\nFlew him down to the Guatemalan border and said ah we're going to use these guys stop migrants from coming in to Mexico so they never make that long trek up to Mexico peninsula up into the United states\nAre extraordinary fast action by Mexico responding your tweet mhm\nAnd and so um you know I Know the president has made these are good [laughter]\nI don't know if they're grandiose statements before about uh you know closing the borders but but you know he has\nActually put into effect some real change in other areas people tend to believe that they have this may be something that comes to fruition I think he's trying to shock these other nations in just saying this is your problem don't let it become ours\nWhen it comes to the borders I don't think the ... the president's ... off because I was one thing you can take the back of people do anything and everything you have\nTo secure the borders of the very first words out of his mouth when he ran for office and he truly believes that a a it's either a problem or the wedding political large but either way\nHe stood by the sea of what the evidence that buys his guarantee that Mexico is going to pay for the sport ... knows he's asking for tens of billions of dollars of us taxpayer money to pay for it it was something more has claimed that somehow Mexico pay for one day with Mexico just got a\nLaugh sort of luck with that Mr President\nWhen you're speaking and he found an ABC News ... Andy as you mentioned meringue fast action by next to kind of send the police officers near border has the president tweeted seems next decode get about their responses please\nI don't know that he has I ever\nThem up on his Twitter feed ... hours he was talking about other things as he left the White House there were two uh although one of the things are actually that happened at the White House kind of blew up today\nAnd that is a John Bolton and the president's chief of staff John Kelly apparently got into a profanity\nLike screaming match outside the oval office today a report from a number of people in the in the west wing basically about this issue that I'm a God ball claiming that person bill sudden\nThe secretary of homeland security wasn't doing our job in protecting the borders and of course John Kelly who used to be the homeland security a director of\nThe secretary of homeland security\nA curse and Nielsen was his deputy and she became the head he was defending her and it appears that the president was on all sides so there seems to be a big brouhaha about this particular subject in the west wing today\nAndy uh I Know that the president likes to lay blame that the footsteps of the Democrats [noise] I have not seen any statement released by them as a whole that addresses the criticism uh this morning of this this tweet have you seen anything from them\nNow but I knew I mean the price of a basic blames anything he doesn't like other Democrats including a you know he says well you know the Democrats are or for having criminals cutting into the country well there is a Democrat in Congress has ever said we want criminals to come into the country\nWhere it's almost impossible to find a Democrat to say what the president says they do say which is we want to open borders no protection do scary slit while they're there is a Democrat I Know is that\nWhat they do say is we want protection for the dream or children who came here after no fault of their own that they want a immigration reform so that\nCompanies are this country who routinely employ a undocumented immigrants or or people who are on visa status\nTo let them have some pathway to citizenship if they want to get in order to make sure that they're not arrested just for coming here to work and provide for their families but go\nAny any kind of paint a picture of what this so called caravan is I mean are they coming by training and a bunch of buses I mean uh in kind of who are these people um I you know I Know the president is calling a lot of them criminals but is there any of the nation are approximate number on who they are and what their motives are I mean I assume looking for work\nOr if it's if you're a bit rich for the president they call them criminals you spent the last two weeks saying that weren't telling people or people are guilty before proven is that when it came to Kevin on the show so\nI'm not quite sure how you know the criminals and was they were all just let our drill and put on cars to drive your primarily families on people who are up ruining their lives they are afraid for the last card to find a better life and here they\nAre you there was one ... just a bunch of people that are all it looks like a caravan but they're all\nDifferent people from different cities are trying to escape the oppression of their country and come to the United states\nAnd and I know that ah the president obviously is been focusing on the midterms uh there's no question that you know this sort of\nWho's balls ... football\nThe Broncos are playing

R. A. Z. E. K. dot com\nWelcome back to a guy Philips rock to you I feel attack waterproof foundation for fair Katie R. S.\nHaving a very very gas ... regularly Anna ... caliber you've heard it talked about Kiki are at an entire station mindedness you'd ask her breast cancer awareness month as a woman who knows other women who have received\nThis diagnosed as I think it's just fantastic that Katie are actually doing that and when I was told how can you find someone to talk about breast cancer I instantly side of the amazing doctors that we have right here in St Louis area and we're very happy to have Dr around those with us today how are you sir I'm wonderful\nThank you so much for having me here Laura and guy I'm\nThanks to our ... were very happy to have you left talk credentials first off first of all talk about this back issue I've been all about breast cancer guy deal here back later the doctor and you\nAre with the Washington University school of medicine of course here in St Louis any do a lot of research at fattening Cancer Center\nYes I've been at site when Cancer Center for eleven years\nBeen a proud St Louis in for fourteen years um I have two children who loves to be here\nCut we are very happy to happy hour why breast cancer\nSo when I was a doctor in training for cancer I decided to focus on breast cancer because it affects women from all walks of life and with proper treatment most women with breast cancer will do very very well\nWhen you are meeting a patient and you realize that she has ... ... what is that like you don't record that diagnosis that\nIt's very it's a very tough thing for a woman to hear\nA breast cancer diagnosis is often a huge shock women are scared they're worried they're wondering how this their life can change how many how much time do they have what's gonna happen to their families so the first thing is to give them some calm reassurance say\nMan what we've got a lot of good options for you let me take you through them\nWhenever you do give that diagnosis I'm sure you start thinking about all the research that you have ... what is some research they are working on right now\nSo we're doing a lot of research about the genes and types of breast cancer so breast cancer is not one disease and cancer can be broken into different subtypes and there are three majors subtypes of breast cancer hormone receptor positive her too positive\nThere's just subtypes of breast cancer harm on receptor positive her too positive and triple negative we found through work on the genes and breast cancer that there is a common area between the Harmon receptor positive and her two positive breast cancer\nWhere we can bring some of the drugs from her too positive cancer in to a specific people that have hormone receptor positive breast cancer and have them work really well\nDr um how much does heredity play in a breast cancer and for those women who have not had a a breast cancer incidence in their lineage how do you explain that\nHeredity a place a portion but there's the vast majority of women more than Ninety percent will have a breast cancer that does not come from their family members\nAre there certain groups such as the Jewish population from a of Eastern European descent that have an increased risk of hereditary breast cancer but um\nBreast cancer as a whole probably Ninety percent or more is non inherited\nAnd so let's talk about a prevention of course you know we hear that word all the time um and and I think as women in family should encourage the men and their families to have their prostate checked\nA man should conversely do that for women to make sure that they didn't have those those breast exam so talk about the preventive measures that one can take a to at least a detect hopefully avoid [noise]\nYes so at this time in Cancer Center we recommend annual mammography typically starting at age forty for average risk women now across the nation there's been some controversy do started aged forty do start at age fifty I think it's simple is to say started aged forty once a year [noise]\nUm you can discuss it with your doctor if you've had a case of cancers in the family than maybe reason to start earlier but again discuss it with your doctor\nSo or just a moment ago you were talking about how they're I guess there are different forms of breast cancer correct yes so every woman's treatment but 'cause I've been lucky enough to not in my at least in my immediate family have anyone that's been a you know how to deal with us but so I guess every woman's a plan to beat\nCancer or breast cancer I mean it is much different well there are categories and so it's important to figure out which category and individual patients and so\nWe look at what is the subtypes the estrogen receptor positive hurt too positive and triple negative and the pathologist tells us that we look at what is the anatomy of the cancer how large is the cancer in Nebraska how many lymph nodes are involved those are all factors that play in\nOur talk with Dr ... and the guy Phillip show and lawyers got another question\nFor you I Want to brag about you know let that because you did receive a huge grant five million dollars for you tell us what you are going to do with that money as far as research goes\nBy a whole bunch of mega man has shed yes go ahead and be from the department of defense really stuck out to me [laughter] yeah\nIt's a ... surprises me to no end that the department of defense funds breast cancer research but I'm the department of defense or funds medical research across a wide range of a medical problems\nAnd some things are obvious such as that are better or militarily related such as head injury so our vets need treatment for head injury and that's one big thing uh but there's other things that are not so obvious in connection with the military um that's a\nKind of a ... of the congressional budget process but the the department of defense gives 'em up close to a hundred million dollars for breast cancer research they've been doing that for close to twenty five years and it's made a lot of difference\nOr their leaps and bounds in in treatments now a or discoveries of ... what are the latest discoveries for women in in breast cancer because you know we read all the time about fascinating things you're doing and I'm Wondering if you do leaps and bounds or if it's just incremental\nOh it's the pace is of progress is incredible so about two days ago the fed the food and Drug Administration approved a new drug for breast cancer it's a drug\nFor patients who are ... to a ... mutations that inherited foreign breast cancer last year there were probably\nA two or three drugs FDA approved outcome new to the market for breast cancer we've seen a whole category of drugs that didn't exist prior to twenty Fifteen come out and there's three drugs in that group for doctors and patients to choose from ... are moving quickly and really positively ...\nAnd St Louis is a wonderful place or cancer research isn't that\nYes the Simon Cancer Center in Washington University are very active in their ... a cancer research programs that breast cancer programs we see I'm\nProbably close to a thousand patients with breast cancer each year in
