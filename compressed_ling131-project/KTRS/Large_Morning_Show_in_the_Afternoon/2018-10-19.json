checked to all of my ticket because I've been buying two tickets for the last I think three or four drawing so they're and they're all in my car and please nobody break into my vehicle but there may be a ten thousand dollar winter and there\nI tend to not to you know I mean I play so infrequently you know it's it is funny now that these gigantic jackpots\nThey dwarf the little ones so it I think what happens is the psychology behind playing\nIs kind of screwed up because normally if you know it got two hundred and Seventy five million that was\nIncredible right then they went into the two two fifty now it's ... billion dollars seriously want it could be won by multiple people but that's your health how he could be one single prize met a billion dollars and you think about the ... billion versus a hundred and Seventy five million\nWhy would you buy a ticket at a hundred and Seventy five million so it takes so much longer\nFor the price to build up because they added those numbers so you know they reduced the number of jackpots to get this exact consequences and we have it and then it's like but I have to say\n[noise] I I I think by buying a ticket you're not playing against me really I think you you know it's all odds\nTo one in three hundred and twenty million or some ridiculous number\nI don't want to say we're not going to win it because I like to have hope that's why I buy the ticket that's why I think it's worth two dollars because the dream that look what we're doing we talk about it here title in the office you're talking about they're pulling their money everybody's thinking what they would do with it do\nExcuse me one second okay can you do this one said\nGod if I win I Will help everyone in the world\n[noise]\nI've never won a large\nStarted\nIt'd

the lottery\nAnd\nGod Bless you God Bless you\nWhere we are on the air yeah we were All right I don't think that's how it got worse because they really really I bet there are people doing the exact same thing I'm doing you know what the difference between bring a church and bring with them for a lottery winners now praying for the lottery when you made it\nSo [laughter] oh I didn't get in\nA room shadow now yeah you can\nBuy the mega millions jak Fridays at a\nBillion dollars okay so is that going to be all on your account when you when news but I think you'd get love five hundred and forty eight million dollars\nWill try I thought it was going to be like maybe seven hundred million or how much to take out from taxes will they take they take out\nThirty nine percent okay protects us then again they reduced the the because we get new witty if you take an annuity that's all they give you one payment big payment and then a thirty equal payments over Thirty years and it goes up five percent every year that's what happens but\nUm that that means the lottery gets to keep all of that money and invest that money and so they get a return on the money you're not taking so that's that's why they reduced the or you know why would anybody take to annuity well you know like we talked about the other day it would be a good thing for people who have\nA ... at this level it's not going to make any difference sure can't spend this kind of money but ... if you took an annuity if you want a smaller amount a hundred million back up that sounds a smaller amount of fifty million ten million whatever\nUh people that have never had money would tend to fritter it away you know free unscrupulous people trying to get into your pocket all the time so you take the annuity because it's guaranteed\nTo come to you every year\nYou know and that's a thirty year guarantee but maybe a ...\nWell\nWent down but at least make it for the fact and I think that probably make it for much else

related to the average changing landscape of today's tomorrow's technology\nTechnology thing is certainly a moving business is\nJoin the conversation on my five year old ... year old now guy Philips K T R S Ryan Calo psyche back to our studios Ryan how are ya I'm good how about yourself and she\nWas she in your area [laughter] that's what happens when I fall if somebody's forehead and fabric sheen I'm\nSorry this is all a tech company so I'm very low it's such a thing you know there probably is probably in fact I'm going to ask you to\nPull up a joke at the end of our segment you know some ... jokes and uh but before we go any further\nUh jak one here is just got married\nI\nListen to your ear in here every week nobody sees your nose yeah but you you do all the video and you do all the you know stuff for the website and you just got me was it what two weeks ago\nI got married I Saturday Saturday Saturday okay\nThat is one each week shy of a year for my daughter's wedding or a job or Twenty years yeah so well actually two weeks congratulations ah yeah you have a baby are now out here All right very good on that [laughter] yeah right while you're\nAt the clock doesn't stop for us it's slow down for you but for us you know we want that grandkid anyway congratulations ... is really cool All right let's let's talk about\nThe disaster recovery first of all disasters a pretty powerful word it is very dark okay let's talk about what a disaster might\nBe so we can be many things so we could have human error which can be your disaster it could be something like a as what's in the show um now I can be something like a fire or a flood a had a lot of those in the area they're ... from time to time throughout the years a power outages things of that nature\nSure that that's a really interesting bringing up I'm thinking about getting a in home safe you know one of those things you both to the floor and it's got to do a little combo isn't all that kind of ... and everything you know fire broke but I really don't have anything to put in it but I'm going to get it in advance of the Powerball or they're making millions\nBut but I'm going to get it in advance of the Powerball or the mega millions [laughter] 'cause I I Will have something to think of American but really this is like a having a safe at home but I'm not really a safe\nYeah it it's very similar to having um a safe or something at home to keep your valuables and you know when you're talking to your business or your personal life um a lot of what we do now is technology based on whether it be pictures at home or your accounting books and everything like that is stored on your computer you have to back it up in some way shape or form in if you're not what happens when it goes away and you know\nFor disaster a ... a recovery would that it also involves ... somebody uh getting into your your system where you have to pretty much change everything up you know if you've been compromised rent\nSomewhere like ... ... yeah so I'm always recovery from that a is a big thing um if somebody gets in there and and lecture data in a way that you can access and or steals your data from you you definitely want to have a backup dose of those files in those systems that you have on there\nThat happens a lot though does well not a lot but I I've heard that you know these guys go for big companies or ask for big checks yeah you'd\nBe surprised so uh they got to really make you usually some sort of ... like ... at the moment exactly [laughter]\nYeah but I'm a a lot of it is a small businesses to you know you'd be surprised ah it's not really going after I'm used to be in in the technology world they would go after the information 'cause it was valuable to them\nNow they want to lock up those files so you can access it because they know what the Bible to you and how much is it worth to you to pay them to unlock that\nSo whether it be a large organization like something like the San Francisco transit that got hit last year that they're still fighting with or something like the hospital out Hollywood that got hit a few years ago where they actually paid those ransom where's where there'd be no small businesses they say okay we'll pay us five hundred dollars you know when will unlock those for you\nI got it so you know when when you get to the five hundred dollar level you're talking to probably high school kids which is entirely possible potentially a ... and do you find that most of these people that get in that uh you know this whole rent some more thing that the um [noise] there you know\nPeople that have worked in the industry and have decided hey I'm going to do some nefarious activity\nSometimes but a lot of it's from overseas is always the room and then it could be a disgruntled individuals um they actually have these are what's called the ransomware for service out there\nAnd you know earlier we were talking about guy buying a fireproof safe you know kind of as a joke but as it is there a way to back up everything on your computer so for example I have a a I built a well along with my cousin a computer at home\nSome years back is there any way for eight or ... it was a radio shack or and we went to ... I I like to dabble in computer technology anyway\nReal question is there a way for me to actually have a physical copy I don't know if it's a ... they even have bigger now don't they are but like a drive somewhere in my house in case for some reason my computer or to catch fire or something crazy like that or if somebody stole my you know\n... so there's different there's different aspects so you have to attach will drives that you can back up your files on 'em but what we do for businesses or something or one is we actually take image based backups so we're not only backing up the\nFiles on their arrest backing up the operating system and the applications and the software so for your home and since you may have games on your computer and stuff and you may have purchased the game keys for multiple different games and you may not have the ability to have those at some point in time or get you back up and running quickly\nSo um for for the business world that's what we do is we take images of those entire systems and the whole copies of those ... now do you have a backup that the backup\nTo having an anti yeah so uh the backups are stored in two separate places um a lot of times we store them on a physical appliance locally inside of the environment and we can do fail over on those should there be some sort of hardware fire on what's called your production machine basically your your machines that you're running on his side of the office and then we also taken the copy goes over to them cloud environment as well\nSo they're hosted off site um so we can have the ability to pull those back down or even run you in a cloud environment should it be that true disaster where there's a fire\nFighter young and this happened to me I mean I had a a Microsoft Word program and um my computer went to blow we\nActually didn't go ... ... it just as I went out to a ... he's there and we talked about the errors like you know I'd have a teacher that I just were around you know just open up my jacket air user Arabs are as my bed [noise]\nUm but I I I put it in a um a a new hard drive a ... a solid state hard drive and uh when I did that apparently the program didn't recognize an asked me for my key\nFor my Microsoft I didn't have it I don't do you know right and I tried all manner of recovery and when you call Microsoft or you\nKnow how much money did they want exactly\nThat's exactly well you know different levels Seventy nine one forty nine two twenty nine right lifetime to Seventy nine [noise]\nUm and it wound up costing me money so it really is a great idea anything that you do on your computer the records you may be to enter some kind of data entry you should have\nMultiple places where you can you know access that information they're one of the things too and this is not really computer related but I found to be helpful and\nI've tried to introduce to my wife a number of times you know because she keeps all of her passwords for those of you want to know if you break into my home go upstairs into her office and there is a a dry erase board that's got everything\nOn it draws on its own you know because\nOh because if you wash up against that you've lost your data\nYeah ... yeah that's right it's called the shoulder security but uh on people's a smart phones\nYou can download and most people probably notice and and I know that get on the book but for the neophyte um you can go get a program that has all the encrypted stuff so you can put in all you have a password application password application right and it really is beneficial Larry you cannot imagine how many times\nEven in a week that you will go to it that you don't have to worry about it or a day and right around ... and most of the time when you need information you're not at home in front of your computer so it's it's good to have that in\nUm October national cyber security awareness month what are you guys doing it so they want to help\nYou do during you know just had a crush the sidelines I thought it was just it was a multi purpose facility yeah and you know what I mean it had great memories there don't get me wrong but uh this is this is a great baseball stadium we've got\nReally reminds me a lot of cars I Lived in Springfield trail out and it looks a lot like the stadium for Springfield card now give me and my\nBig anyone uh-huh oh yeah right yeah it it has gotten more of a minor league feel you know I've been to Raleigh Durham and and the same kind of deal that brick exterior it really is a classic I like it a lot better and I like the fact that the seats are actually closer to the field they stack\nEverybody up so you're kind of on top of the action as opposed to that you know sweeping low bowl you know thing so anyway um by the way the same speed the ravens this weekend Drew Brees will become just the third quarter back\nTo have defeated all thirty two teams are the only other to to do it\nBrett fat free and\nPay tone mending there you go\nAnd find a way just a little note the NFL is still America's favorite sport but other sports more popular in three major markets\nMajor league baseball is more popular in New York and Chicago and the NBA is bigger in L. A. I suppose there talking to cities that have all of those team I guess because I don't care about the NBA and now I don't care about the NFL so much I Know we don't\nCare about the NFL but I have did you see all over Facebook over the past day or so they're talking about chargers may be coming to St Louis I Know it was a rumor but they claim I guess they're Haagen sales are so\nLow out there uh you know kind of in their shared a little area with the rams now that there's been chatter about them coming to a steel and I don't really care but\nIt's a sports I don't care how I Am the networks have Facebook yeah it was on Facebook I think it would actually true it was Fox two news showed it on their Facebook page yeah if it's if it's on Facebook it's got to be true it's Fox you know I don't believe that for one\nSecond but it's fun too I just sat around on a yeah you know the rams leaving here a few years ago and all of a sudden\nLet's take another team but we're never going to get another NFL too I Can't imagine\nMartha tape Sherry well listen I Would love to I'd love to it was a change in the armor and you know I mean I didn't ... I wasn't a big fan of that\nAnd it probably ... when I Lived in LA it was really weird to see ...

B. L. so natural walking back\nDown there will come back get fined golf as\nI did I had a great time a plane at the greenbrier in West Virginia\nYou are wonderful West Virginia oh you did you ever play their Ah yes I have that's why the that areas by stopping arousal from West Africa\nOh sure yeah absolutely not far at all well I I didn't break time and I'm probably one of the best massages I've ever had my like I mentioned that because that's the kind of stuff that when I retire that's what I Want to do golf massages\nSo you're going to be a Mrs\nSupplemental income I guess ... so uh you know let's do something funnier first of all uh have you purchase the mega millions ticket\nWell of course there are a good doctor I liked it may charitable donation so that's actually a way you know I'm just going to say to the ... and I went a little threatened do it on or even like everybody else\nBut you have to remember that you know you can't imagine that you're going to win the whole thing of course you know I said you know God I'll take twenty percent I mean why why why be greedy and then the question becomes what do you do with the money going out so you don't run out like most lottery winner\nAnd the first thing you should do is contact your water yeah because most likely you're going to probably do this in a way where you're going to divide it\nAnd you're going to want to make sure that you can do this on a ... tax basis so you'll probably end up setting up some trust and those trusted redistributing income when you may want to be charitable a little bit so that you can get some tax deductions\nBut I get like re takeover\nYeah you know and and this you know what it was a greed is good was that Wall Street\nGreed is good when it's about you know exactly okay\nWell you guys you know that I you know I I think typing is better but you know yeah get a little greedy I have some fun with it but um so you know as far as an investment just for the fun of but you know you better I got I bought a ticket [noise] um so you know we when the darn thing do what you know what do we do what would you do\nWell I Would certainly be looking at break a portfolio into two pieces okay well peace would be income\nSo I Want to say how much you know income I Would want to see how much fun money I Would have which means you know the extravagance spending in terms of you know other houses of buying your mom a house or something and then when I Would do is I Would British a part of it really for gross so\nBuying things that aren't going to create taxable income which is smart and then obviously have either tax free or partially taxable income so that you can maintain a lifestyle that you want because I'm Sorry but I won't be on the radio anymore\nHow am I going to have to go to work or she'll be broke but she was\nGoing on so we don't carry the load [laughter]\nWell you know she she's cut up she's got a you know she'll have to wait\nThat's it yeah wait till the field that kicks All right so let's let's go ahead and dismissed the winning the lottery and let's talk about you know Boston upped portfolio into those two are grown and that's something you would probably do any way and that's something you may talk about on your show straight talking to retirement which\nIs of course every Saturday morning here at ten o'clock on the big five fifty some talk about the about bad and maybe what's on the show tomorrow\nThat's fine and you know it's interesting because most you know there's a thousand different articles that are written about how to figure out how much capital and how much percentage of ... but really when it comes down to is spending we find that our goal with all of our clients is to try to replace\nUm one hundred percent of their net spend ... income that they are receiving today\nBecause if they're in a position where they can retire with that means is is that they're not living beyond their means so whatever other journalists spending today is what they're going to continue to spend a retirement so we find specifically for that number so again what I Would do is I Would create a portfolio\nThat had a great probability of being able to reach that income go every single month\nAnd put the right side for growth so that you can tap it when you need it at the same time that if you want to you know how you have some money sitting around so that's really what you want to keep it on your for your time today and if you do that and you found to that number you find out that um your your continue to have the good life chat right\nNow and I liked was dragged to Jeff says don't bother the conventions of believing eighty percent of your current income would be acceptable not German bloody get a hundred percent of your income for greater\nFor sure I mean I mean think about it today guy what happens is no matter what your gross is your\nSure I mean I mean think about it today\nGuy what happens is no matter what your groceries you're probably a journal only getting between six fifty five percent of that is a net income that's correct yes you're making contributions to your time or clans you're paying for health insurance is recalling taxes all that kind of\nCourse as how much do you have left at the end of the day you're spending all that your real life or your dues you increase that like when you get into account factors and\nGo to the races or go get a lot of\nThem are still there\nAre still ten minutes I said\nWell these are things that I'm sure are uh money put thought we could do it and that's the\nFood for thought but in terms of dollars and cents\nAnd Jeff in Iran will be on tomorrow morning straight talking German right here on the big five fifty and\nIt's one quick our but they love to
