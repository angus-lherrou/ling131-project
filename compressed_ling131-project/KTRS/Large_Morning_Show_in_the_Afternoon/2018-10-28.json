specialist\nPresident of saving money retirement\nYou're one stop source of no market risk strategic plans\nHave you ever seen the movie cliffhanger was Sylvester Stallone\nWhile I was just watching that movie the other night\nAnd they had the usual acting you might expect from a stone action ... what really struck me was the opening scene and I have forgotten how intense it was so they're still on his character he was helping a female climber\nAnd I I just can't remember the name of that actress but anyway she was sliding across or rope from one class to another class Warner harnessed became on buckled as she fell out of the harness Stallone slit across the ... and grabbed her hand\nWell we've all seen the I got you move in so many of these movies and it's kind of cliche a bus except for in this movie instead of rescuing the girl there was a pro long sequence where her hand begins to slip out of songs grip finger by finger\nThe whole time she screaming I don't want to die I don't want to die to backdrop behind her looks to be over one mile down to the valley floor and if you haven't seen the movie before well then you're going to be sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for him to grab her or the other hand are somehow save the day\nBut this movie catches you off guard\nUnlock the typical Hollywood happy ending her hand slipped all the way out she falls while maintaining eye contact list alone her horrifying scream and the look on her face she falls really got my heart pumping\nAnd you know I Know after but I Do say people from falling unlike Stallone nobody has ever slipped out of my head\nBut I Do say people from falling unlike Stallone nobody has ever slipped out of my hands not a single one of my clients I've ever had their retirement fall off of a cliff and not one of them has ever lost a penny do the stock market losses\nAnd not that some of you is your retirement wasn't at risk of being dropped off a cliff either for that reason alone now will be a great time to give me a call\nAnd how about a guarantee of a bonus on your money of up to ten percent or more and how about a guarantee of income account valued growing at up to seven and a half percent for the purpose of receiving guaranteed lifetime income\nAnd how about the guarantee that your principal and returns will never decreased due to market losses\nAnd so if you like to learn more give me a call from my free retirement income book and retirement income kit at eight four for five one three safe again my number is eight four for five one three seven to three three\nAnd there are no stock market cliffs with my income planning so what have you got to lose\nYou know I Know some people are afraid of heights and some people are not but regardless what I can guarantee you is that everyone is afraid of heights if they're falling without a parachute\nI think the same is true when it comes to people's retirement and risk some people are afraid of risk and some people are not well at least they say they aren't\nBut everyone is afraid when the market crashes\nYou know I've seen clients would that saying look on their faces as the actress in the movie [noise]\nThey're not usually screaming but sometimes they are crying they're always looking at me with eyes that say save me\n[noise] you know I said my clients from lots of things sometimes I save them from having all their money exposed a risk and sometimes I saved them from high fees that are eating up all of their returns\nAnd other times I'm saving them from having NO PLAN or a bad plan that their broker has put together for them with no consideration for guaranteed lifetime income and protection of their principal\n[noise] you know it doesn't matter if my clients are screaming are crying or looking like they're about to pass out on the bottom drops out\nIf the purpose of your money is live there are only two plans for that purpose [noise] want to call a plan for death and the other is called a plan for life if you have a broker or a financial planner that isn't an expert in plans for life I Am certain you're on a plan for death [noise]\nWhat is a plan for death when it comes to your retirement income well here it is\nYou save up your money and invested in something that provides a hypothetical non guaranteed right of return or a short term guaranteed right of return\nIn other words you have no guarantee for long term growth you might hope for seven percent compound of growth after fees market downturns rate explorations and so forth\nYou see you have no idea what kind of return they're going to get in fact you don't even know if you're going to get any return because the next two thousand and eight might be right around the corner\nYou save up your money hoping it grows and then at the point that you decided to retire he started drawing income from your accounts well how much do you draw out four percent three percent or they just are all out the amount that you need and hope for the vast\nYou see the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical growth is combined with an arbitrary spend down on your retirement accounts you see you have no idea if the plan is going to work because you don't know how long you're going to live [noise]\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent two little if you live longer than you thought well you will probably run out of money before you die\nIn order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by certain age that is why we call it a plan for death\nDo you want to plan on dying or a plan on living\nIn a second I'm going to tell you about a plan for life and if you want to find out specifically how I Know market risk plan for life would apply to your retirement well give me a call and I can show you a better way to live\nAway towards lifetime income accounts that isn't wasted away by fees that comes with upfront bonuses um up to ten percent or more\nWhich will never show any market

tunes and you know market risk or retirement an asset protection specialist\nAt you probably know from listening to me for a while I don't like risk very much\nAnd with that being said some risk is worth taking for example having children is a risk\nThose of you that have children know that to be a true fact\nThere's a lot of time and a lot of money not to mention blood sweat and tears that goes into raising children and even if you're the perfect parent it doesn't always turn out the way you want it to almost everyone I talked to that have had problem children have said that they still up their kids and wouldn't trade them in for the world\nEven in a very sad situations where children prematurely pass away parents are grateful for the time they have had what something you could definitely say that children are risk worth taking\nNot some risks are definitely not worth taking I think jumping out of an airplane without a parachute will fall into that category\nI don't think any of my clients would argue with me or they wouldn't be my clients for very long held by taking a risk that you don't have to take you don't have to risk your retirement money but many people do for no good reason at all\nWhat would you rather have financial planning based on guarantees instead of risk [noise] how about a guaranteed bonus of up to ten percent or more or how about a guaranteed income account value growing at up to seven and a half percent for the purpose of receiving guaranteed lifetime income [noise]\nHow about the guarantee that your principal and returns will never

how to protect your money from high fees and market downturns so give me a call anytime at eight four for five one three safe\nThat date for four five one three seven to three three\nNow let's talk some more about risk we take in life how about buying a home\nFor many people buying a home is one of the largest purchases that they're ever going to make what rich do you have when you buy a home well for one you have risk of market value loss many people learned that in two thousand eight right\nMany people thought there was no significant risk from your home going down in value mutt that perception is now changed what about risk of property loss\nFlood fire earthquake when storm and even the south are all things that could destroy the value of your home investment\nOther properties that you might all have the same risks if you own a car or a boat airplane or any other property was significant value there is a risk of loss\nWhen you own something up significant material value what do you do to protect yourself from financial loss\nI think you know the answer insurance try\nInsurance costs money and nobody likes spending money on something that I Will probably never use so why do you buy insurance on your home [noise]\nWell you might say I have a loan on my house so I have to buy insurance on it but that might be true but what if you're homeless paid far would you still buy insurance I bet you would but why\nWhy do you realize it or not you wouldn't buy insurance on your home because of something called catastrophe risk\nCatastrophe risk means that you have a chance even if it's a small chance to lose a lot of value in other words money if something bad will happen\nThe reason we buy insurance on our homes is because the cost of insurance is very small compared to the last that we might incur if a catastrophe happens\nSo for the fun of it let's assume you live in a modern home up the current building codes you don't smoke and you're not going to fall asleep and bad wire smoking you don't light candles and leave them unattended you don't put fried chicken on the stove and leave the kitchen\nIf I'm describing you then there was a very small chance your house is going to catch on fire right\nEven so I bet you have home insurance and the reason why is because losing your home will be a catastrophic financial loss so they're relatively small cost of insurance is worth paying for am I right\nWell you know I'm right so let me ask you another question why don't you have insurance on your retirement money shouldn't you\nShouldn't costs now for your

I'm sure that just like me you honor our soldiers and their service to our country [noise]\nAnd it's their sacrifice that gives us the privilege to even talk about the options of retirement safety and security you see without a safe country it would be impossible to find a safe haven for our money well that being said let me tell you a quick story about a noble\nOn a safe haven for our money well that being said let me tell you a quick story about a noble soldier this soldier had the mindset that fighting with a gun lacked honor and chose to only fight with his life\nHe was honorable brave and highly skilled at all types of fighting and all types of weapons yet he's still persisted and only using his knife in battle\nWell fortunately his enemies did not participate in as ideals and even though this soldier ... he died on the battlefield [noise]\nThe moral of the story is that good intentions do not win battles and if you bring a knife to a gunfight you're defeated a well before the fight even starts good intentions must be matched by the right equipment to complete the mission\nSo let me ask you is your retirement suffering from bad equipment choices [noise]\nYour investment advisor might have very good intentions but if he is using the wrong tool to keep your money safe then your retirement may very well be destined to die in battle\nRisky investments should be retirement tools mostly use for the young or the extremely wealthy [noise]\nIt is way too often that they are used for those that are either in or approaching retirement and these are the folks that cannot afford to lose their money at all\nAlso just because your broker tells you it's safe doesn't make a true unfortunately many investments such as bonds goals and even variable annuities are often

three\nOne of my clients you asked me one time they said what's the difference between you and a stockbroker while with some humor but also sincerity I said well one differences is that I won't jump out of a window when the stock market crashes\nThat may be a joke but every joke there's also a little bit of truth I can joke around like this because out of the millions and millions of dollars in retirement money that has been protected not a single penny has ever been lost due to market declines\nAlso in all honesty I Can't figure out why variable products that that is products where you can lose money are called securities water secure about them I can assure you every time the market crashes nobody feels secure\nSpeaking of security let me tell you another quick story\nWe had a client

are today\nWell no actually I did I was kind of going through remembering memory laying on my own ... started or a little bit ago and\nMy older daughter really put me on me\nThat I'm I'm sitting here today on I I was working for a while or apple computer back then so they drop the computer and I found out a room ... dad who was a bit of a crime that I\nWas so annoyed with the concept called time off and time off requests and so I wanted to spend more time with her but then like the restrictions of a corporate gig\nAnd tried my hat at all for yourself and did that early on in the two thousand and five and it was a bumpy road said we\nWere they challenging wrote emotionally got married during that on almost got divorced and during that time got through a lot of struggles came out on the

the way we're helping people and being able to bend primary family travel all all of the things I wanted I I mean sure was instilled in the DNA of the company\nYou know and so when you think about that you know you hear a lot of people use that word entrepreneur and and so here you got a pretty good gig I Would assume with apple or were you living in California where are you still in Arizona at that time\nI was still in Arizona but that was the writing on the wall was to move to California there was real no growth path that I wanted that didn't have that and destination and it was a big

all is I\nUm I was moonlighting at nights and weekends I was freely and fame and there were a couple of big opportunities that I knew if I\nHad more time I would at least have a couple of months runway financially to be able to take advantage of so I just didn't quit cold turkey with nothing plant and not being you know I'm On the horizon and now the horizon was only about\nOr that way maybe you itemize this year because you make a larger adoption this year but you don't itemize next year\nYou know yeah I think that is a big deal is if you're going to be on that border line than if you're going to write a check in January or February and march anyway if you can afford it right to check in December get a much bigger tax reduction today right\nThat's right yeah and if and if your charity or doesn't want you to do that because they want to have a recurring\nRevenue you can use a potentially a donor advice signed a get your deductions as soon as you contribute to a donor advice on and then make those contributions or recommend the contributions to charity or overtime or like your charity wants\nYeah we do a lot of that for clients with the donor advise funds as a big deal so people can you can actually donate money from an account\nInto this donor advise fund that would be invested and then you can give that money to later date now it has to be taken out right but in the year but uh it can be given a later date so are those are big things I mean these advice on that obviously talked to I Andrew at a green sweltering give us a buzz and visionary wild advisors\nAs well so a moron charitable gifts let's talk about that what can I Do what can I Do\nYeah they are the important thing for a charitable gift to make sure you can get the adoption and two thousand Eighteen if you're looking for that is is date of delivery\nUh and uh for example when you write a check to a charity date of delivery is if you want to hand deliver it that's going to be your date of delivery but uh if you post mark the check by December thirty first that's\nGoing to count as a as a two thousand Eighteen deductions so you don't have to actually clear clear to check a which is different rule for for different types of gifts but for charitable gifts that that's what's important\nRedd jak read them read I'm begging right I'm often right that's right [laughter]\nUh so four oh one K. is a big difference here that most people don't think about it as a IRAs versus four oh\nOne case when can I give or not even get but when can I contribute when can't contribute burnt to count for two thousand and Eighteen\nRight so you know you are kept at Eighteen thousand five hundred for uh people under the catch a page which I think it's fifty or fifty five\nOr ... eighty thousand five hundred for this year for four one K. contributions and you have to make those contributions by December thirty first two thousand Eighteen or to to fit within that limit that time period now IRAs are a little bit different\nUh you haven't tell tax time next year April fifteenth to set up and contribute to an IRA that counts as a contribution in two thousand Eighteen you know\nI think for clients that that's a big deal to because you want to make sure you can get the contribution and so if you have in Iran and you can do the fifty five hundred dollars per year per individual you know that you have until April fifteenth to get that in but again you're four one K. plan you got to get that in by December thirty first\nSo I'm five twenty nine plan so we talked a little bit about retirement high level dive into a little bit high level on five twenty nine plans are for those that don't know if our listeners five twenty nine point is used for college savings\nAs long as it's used for higher education that grows without taxes it can come out without taxes but talk about the state and local tax deductions sure\nYeah so ... each year you make a contribution to five twenty nine in both Illinois and in Missouri\nUh you get a state income tax deduction both of them have their limits are which are slightly different from Missouri in Illinois but ah but you do get that deduction so if you're going to make a contribution in two thousand Eighteen you can get that deduction\nA there's a new rule was five twenty nine that allows them to be used for elementary and secondary\nNine that allows them to be used for elementary and secondary education up to ten thousand dollars per year per beneficiary\nAnd so if you know you're going to be paying 'em you know private school tuition next year for example and you have the funds available now you can go ahead and get a state income tax deduction now put it in five twenty nine and then use that to pay tuition next year\nAnd I think to the new tax law correct me if I'm wrong but uh you can now use that for a higher education for high school in in private in grade school yeah right yeah yep which is brand new for those people that don't know that that is brand new like within the last you know maybe a handful of months here three six seven months a that's a new deal\nThat's right they have that came with the the two thousand Eighteen tax back\nYeah so again if you want to write a check for your kids you know you go to a private high school in St Louis or Illinois or you go to you know private ah elementary school you can donate that money and let it grow a not donate contribute that money let it grow tax deferred or without it so\nI'm Talking about five point I talked about retirement let's talk about tax last harvesting I think that's a big thing that most people don't know about or don't think about when it comes a year in planning\nBut it's crucial in most people's investment planning in my opinion [noise]\nRight yeah bread and I'm sure you can talk about this uh at length as well but um you know what the market down a little bad maybe have some investment losses a number one they could help offset some gains that you might have from this year a by selling off some physicians and then taken all off a number\nTo uh up to a certain extent or they can actually reduced uh be deducted against your income for this year so up to three thousand dollars for a even if you don't have investment gains\nAnd then they can be carried over into future years as well\nYeah so we don't talk specific investments on the show but if you own you know ABC company stock and that stock is down a three thousand dollars\nRight I can take that loss and I can apply that towards my taxes correct that's right yeah so it's it's just a very crucial part of planning that we can help people lower taxes just by doing that type of planning so\nUm gift planning let's talk about gift planning now what are the rules how much can I give\nThere was one time exemptions or yearly contributions to talk to us about that\nYeah so that the federal or state tax and give tax system says that each person can give away currently the exemption is eleven point one eight million dollars per person without paying tax\nDuring their life or by if you get if you are using that exemption mouth and that reduces your estate tax exemption him out and that there's\nA a ... another special exclusion from\nGet taxes that says you can make a gift of up to Fifteen thousand dollars per year per do me a without even reducing that estate gift an estate tax exemption\nOr the important role for that is that be done obviously are in the end this year and unlike charitable gifts or that the check actually has to be cashed by the recipient in two thousand Eighteen for it to count as an annual exclusion gift and two thousand Eighteen\nYeah I think the the eleventh point one eight that's per individual rights of you have a married couple a truly what does that twenty two point three six million that you could pass on to the next generation\nCrash right and and that that that doesn't affect many people but it but it does affect some and then in Illinois it's important to know that the exhibit estate tax exemption per person is for a million\nAnd a it's not portable like uh the federal exemption is as you describe with proper plan and you can essentially make it portable but it's not automatically a portable between spouses\nGot it um and now we're gonna talk about these complex trust rates I mean that's that's a that's a whole nother level stuff that people may or may not be aware of but talk to us about that\nYes you are so this is a year in a income tax savings idea if you're a beneficiary of an irrevocably trust\nA ... a couple of trust that are complex trust\nPay income taxes at a much higher rate or they hit the highest marginal rate much faster or talk in ... after ten twelve thousand dollars of income in a trust and they start paying the highest possible income tax rate where's the beneficiaries\nPay individual rights and you know at the highest rate as an individual into you know you're in the half a million dollar range of income\nUh so you can pay a lot lower overall income tax rate if distributions are made a to a beneficiary rather than held in the trust\nNow for to count this as a two thousand Eighteen distribution or it doesn't actually have to be made by December thirty first two thousand Eighteen but I say why procrastinate\nA you know if you if you know that you're going to save income taxes overall start addressing it now ah the actual distribution could come out as late as sixty five days after the beginning of two thousand Nineteen and still count as a two thousand Eighteen distribution but it's time to start thinking about that planning now\nYou know and everything I think we are talking about so far as really planning right I mean I think so many of us as just as human beings I think we kinda procrastinate wait till the end so hopefully our listeners can get this advice\nAnd do something with it but if I if I'm sitting here right now and I'm I'm In my car and um listen to this show is who is this for is this for the extremely wealthy is this for the low income middle income who's it for\nIt's for everybody I mean this particular ah example of a you know comes to comes to in in my life in this example when someone received an inheritance\nUh and uh they receive 'em they become a beneficiary of a trust for example march first of this year and that trust that some income\nOr they should consider getting some getting some income out of it a distribution out of that trust or state or so that they pay a lower overall income taxes\n... I Know you're a a very charitable guy and we've talked about the charitable type stuff on the planning side let's let's flip the page a little bit and talk about personally I Know you've got a lot of causes you're a big part of an ah like I said of big charitable guy I talked to us about a couple of causes it mean a lot to you\nSo everything craft down in two thousand and while I my abuse led to some terrible decision one of which was an affair that populated and circus stuff and and um and you're really I ... you know losing my business losing my wife losing everything\nAnd I went to a church and cameras on them a Christian Church called cornerstone and the very first survivor and you know this is like\nI'd have been a church since I was a kid I don't like you know what\nThe cannot her obviously my career when it's not worth the work that I work in her right so we're in the very\nFirst servant of the CERN series the idol would discern what's changed your family tree and ... ... ... a a load of wrecks just falling on me I realize\nLike I have a chance maybe it was a super sliver of a chance at that time but\nI Need to change my family tree\nI Need to do that [noise] and so that was in two thousand is well my wife and I just\nWork their ass is off to stay married counseling I got sober dollar new Thirteen which would ban to do things in anger and then I released the final bird and in my life with my dad is a business that wasn't working for about four [noise] and um [noise]\nAnd then to take a walk for months later and stuff and it's just when we\nCome back after these messages were going to die of more into what this really means on changing your family tree but if you want to hear more from the start of success you can go to our website circuit of success dot com you can go to our visionary wealth advisor website to\nLearn more about our firm so we come back we'll be more from a raspberry\nTempers ... were taking part like hash tag ... tank on social media will honor survivors and knows we've lost his disease joined Katie are asked all month as we joined the fight to cure a breast cancer ...
