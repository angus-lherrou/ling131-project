were talking Social Security you\nKnow every week we tried to bring you a great guest and a great guess it's going to help you if you can just take one nuggets\nAway from that I guess that's going to help you and your every single day life and uh you know it's the it's the attitude it's the belief system is the action that you take every single day that's going to get your results so we're going to help you a lot on this show with the mindset from some gas than just like Greg today we're going to help you with the financial planning side\nOf what it takes to be successful and those circuits of success that we believe here visionary while the visor so welcome back to the show and again we are with Greg ... certified financial planner with visionary well the badgers and Greg we're talking about now is\nHow many people receiving benefits for Social Security\nFor about sixty two million people that are currently receiving benefits in about ten million of those are coming through disability benefits\nSo what's that looked like so for somebody to disabled or you know you always hear the stories of I mean what what's what's a typical story if you even know a typical story as somebody this disabled and they can get Social Security benefits now so you know age forty five\nWell an obvious one would be you know we think about the things that just like all timers or A L less something like that and so um\nThat is something that someone at any age could start receiving disability benefits and um if\nThose folks actually had children the children could actually received some benefits as well so I I I Know a racist ... of a of a person that has a an old timers diagnosis\nAnd the children will you know pretty early onset right and as children under the age of Eighteen and so um those children there's as what they call a family maximum\nSo let's say for example to the person that uh the ... there's been diagnosed they look\nAt their full retirement age benefit let's say that's twenty five hundred dollars a month [laughter]\nUm and just didn't know so the maximum someone can get today is roughly about twenty eight hundred dollars a month at age call it sixty six that's roughly wherever we wait to Seventy it's higher but I'm\nThe family maxim could be between a hundred and fifty to a hundred and eighty percent of that number ...\nSo the children when I Would of could also be receiving benefits from that this to build on\nSo how are those let's talk about that what we're talking about calculations and stuff how our benefits calculators\nSo in a case like this social skills if someone passes away or becomes disabled Social Security assumes that that\nPerson who live 'til like their full retirement age right so for example the thirty year old passed away their spouse their family would receive benefits really based upon not their earnings record at that time or the years they had paid in but really they would call them almost fully insured\nRight so so there's there's not a reduction of benefits which is a great benefit to to families that have been through a tragedy like that\nBut um for those that make it to full retirement age they look at your thirty five highest ears so if you have Thirty years of earnings you would have five years as the heroes if you have forty years of earnings\nDidn't your highest thirty five is how that's calculate and there's actually three bands that they use to calculate it in\nThe form they can get a little bit complicated but um there's actually three dance for so for example someone was a a lower or maybe earned Fifteen thousand dollars a year or something like that working maybe part time\nThey're going to get them they're going to get Ninety percent of that number has that first band so they they try to help those that are making a little bit less to get a higher percentage of those first dollars that you actually earn\nSo now a we have to go on line right we used to get the nice white and green little thing in the mail and that would tell us what we've earned and and what benefits looked like him and so now do you recommend people go on line and viewing their Social Security profile\nWhy do for one just be so you can look at your earnings record because all that information is there you can do that I read the essay dot Gov slash my account\nAnd it used to go to the Social Security administration website you that you could get there but I think it is a good thing to set up your account you can always go in there and look at your record make sure it's correct in a in a give you your numbers whether you're\nIf you're living right if you pass away team disabled all those numbers are available\nAt that site got it so what if now let's turn into the ... right so what if one of a spouse never earn an income can receive benefits\nTo a ... and the answer to that is yes so\nYou know when social in Nineteen thirty five year we had a lot of one\nFamily one earner per family right in today obviously that's a lot different but when the system when it was set up they noticed that and so we don't want to penalize people for staying home or doing charity work or something like that so [noise] so yes a I'm\nA spouse or their spousal benefits available um and\nThat actually works out to fifty for you you can receive fifty percent of the higher earners Social Security benefit for example right if someone's give it a higher order is getting two thousand dollars a month the secondary earner can get either their benefit\nTo Weber cattle has been a favorite

of the things we talk about 'em but are you talking about a lot as they're restricted application\nTell us more about that so that's something that's the last couple of years is fairly new because Social Security did make some changes to the violence suspend rule did go away recently but there is something called a restricted application that um [noise]\nUm for those born prior to January first of Nineteen fifty for this\nRestricted application can come into play so for example if we have one spouse who's this ... they're both sixty six let's say and the and the and the first benefit is twenty four hundred for the higher earner in two thousand for the secondary or her\nSpouse number two can restrict their application so spouse one files spouse to simply say you know what\nI'm going to delay my benefit I'm going to start taking a spousal benefit at age sixty six and I'm going to let my benefit grow to age Seventy so they're essentially what they're calling restricting their application [laughter]\nSo what they're going to do\nIs they're going to take [noise]\nTwelve hundred dollars a month as a spousal benefits because bounce one is getting twenty four hundred and they're going to let their two thousand dollar benefit grow to age Seventy right which is going to be about twenty six hundred dollars\nSo that's called a restricted application essentially where one spouse files and the other one then starts drawing a spousal benefits to age Seventy because they're getting those eight percent credits every year so we're going to get a hundred and thirty two percent of their benefits that something is still out there for a few people\nThat are a key when it comes a planet knowledge it's like I say all of these strategies and brought what I've found is that you know I'll do these I'll do some seminar sometimes no walk through this thing and\nThe message is really wait right if you can wait please wait because\nHopefully a lot of us are alive at eighty eighty five Ninety eroded need income right in the longer we do a lay these benefits the higher it's gonna be a right to Social Security projects about two percent two point six percent inflation cost of living going for us if you took it that math I mean\nA lot of money out there so so we're really looking to to to wait but always get someone at the end that will say okay so you said I could start drawing it's sixty two right I Want to ask [laughter]\nRight that's correct yeah even though it doesn't make sense to it so much we want it now yes right and there are some things that you can look at this uh what if I took all that money and I could invest it and make ... percent on my money well those are calculations that that you can do we can do those but\nBut really we're not encouraging people to take that money early just because the math and the spousal there's survivor benefit is such a big deal such a big deal if it if I start taking my benefit\nAt sixty two and then I pass away right in my spouse might inherit my spousal benefits you know it could have been so much greater if I Would have waited till I was at least sixty six\nYou know it could have been so much greater if I Would have waited till I was at least sixty six maybe Seventy set up to start doing\nThat so great we've obviously work together for a long time and uh I consider your dear friend but I think also when I look at you as a I Would say very thorough and a very thoughtful\nFinancial planner and why do you think that is I mean is that something you just you know I you know knowing your family just the family values that you were raised with I mean why do you think that is why do you love doing what we do\n[noise] well this is a I've been doing these about Twenty years now and um you know I it's it's just a lot of\nFun right meeting people one on one hearing different stories because every story is different\nAnd um you know I think we're just really advocates for for people right I'm just I'm someone to help\nTo walk beside right our clients right and then a lot of those folks have done a great job of saving for retirement but I had someone a couple of years ago tell me who is retiring and he said I've always done this myself I just said I just want someone else to care about my money\nTo go out there\nIt's really that simple I mean we're just there really to help to help facilitate and really to help make sure people make good decisions right in in\nThe market's going to do it the market's going to do right and it's really our job to help them want to make sure that they're taking the appropriate risk that they're comfortable with but just to help make sure that they don't make bad decisions and hopefully make good decisions whether you're allowed\nIs helping was fear right emotions are greed whatever that emotion is going to be I Know that's a lot of stuff that we talk to our clients about [noise]\nWell it isn't and and fear as much in Reno fears really much stronger right because when the market goes down we hear from our clients a lot more because they're they're fearful that they're going to\nTo lose a lot of their money they may never get back in so it's really our job really with the market's been great for years and uh you know we will it will always be that way in such really where we I think we are in our money is when the market\nDoes go south to make sure we have things in place that we can get through those times\nYou know Greg one of the things I think that uh is important for other companies to know as well is one of the things that you do you go out to a lot of companies I Know you've been to Florida and you've been out east and and done it but you do a lot of them locally but\nIf somebody wants you to come in and educate their employees or or just even a group of friends tell us about that what do you do\nI found that that is my my passion there's a lot of\nGreat financial planning information out there but Social Security is unique mind because I said it does affect all of us and so right if if someone wants me to speak at their church at their company at their club\nOh those are things I like to do right and so I Would certainly love that be willing to do that the um\nLove to share the information about Social Security and and the company that I use they have lots of different presentations too so we can pay their presentations towards couples\nWe can pay their presentations tourist just women right and I you know women are great saver some it was my best clients right so the the women's presentation is fantastic to do so\nUh would love to do is to share their information and feel free to reach out if you want that ... if he if he like for me to come and talk and love

Fifteen a you know your big time saying was radio man I'm disassemble white dress was Butler County hillbilly but it seemed a little peculiar to me to go from ... where an Obama supporter\nTwo genes in ... right winger in the span of what twenty months right seem like a lot and I think that um\nThey're literally been no authenticity and this man from the beginning and yes I predicted he would be a terrible governor it'd be a disaster I was so wrong it's far worse than I ever could have predicted\nThe report since this first story came out he kept saying it was a consensual relationship it was consensual I strayed I Apologize it was consensual reading lists reports doesn't read like it was a consensual relationship\nNot in any way it's one of the most discussed is probably the most disgusting document to the states Missouri on it [noise] ah the woman cries a deposition uh biased is sex crimes lawyers\nAnd doubt been it where they just made her sob the whole thing is disgusting and look I think there's there's things that happened in life\nAnd this is obviously not his best chapter borders describe what validates every critic of him that ever criticize Eric Greitens is the fact he's insisting on taking the state of Missouri and its reputation down into his sex dungeon basement and it's going to take years to overcome it there have\nBeen um high profile Republicans like John ... and some others who have called for him either to step down or being paged but are you surprised there are more Republicans who were coming out in a city there's a lot\nA lot that are but look you can imagine the amount of money this governor has very little of it from Missouri and now none of it from Missouri\nPours in from San Francisco Washington I mean it it is more money than any ... more money we've ever seen and they play rough I can tell you they play rock with me uh they fed up research to a guy that paint on the radio anymore but\nActually I think many Republicans are now saying they have the anti just touch if you want to get to calls or this guy it's a career in ... there is a I guess what is being called the Turner caucus of Republicans led by window Frank or in the state house it's a I don't know if they wanted her to lose some teeth before they could say condemning I don't really know\nIf you're still with Eric Greitens today I don't think you should be making decisions and if you ever run for office again there'll be one hillbilly on a show like this reminding folks now this was the pro domestic violence Republican\nGot high Turner being the reference to the domestic violence I Turner who beat up Tina Turner a probably\nThe one person that one this week was Ike Turner 'cause he might not be the most high profile a domestic violence versus enough air Greitens might be that guy ...\nWhat happens now I'm Josh Hawley came out and said he should step down Peter ... came out and said he should resign used um high profile Republicans as Kelly said but what's the next step now down there [noise] um well if you can imagine you're\nSign up to serve the legislature you're thinking I'm going to cut taxes are on I'm going to get a real paved in my district ... and now you're dealing with this and the governor won't leave and then the governor of tax the people so a hundred and fifty four to nothing is what they form this committee with\nHow you couldn't get a resolution saying water is wet to pass a hundred and fifty four to nothing adjusted and\nThese guys take their own time a lot of their time and look I'll just tell you a lot of folks who don't make that much money and so you may live in like west plains or somewhere Springfield and you have to stay in extra day ah you miss your family they they they did the best they can do to put this report together in the time they had and the governor they they ask him to ...\nThey did the best they can do to put this report together in a time they had and the governor they they ask him to come they wrote him they didn't really they could do he wouldn't come\nAnd if you know the truth why can't you said the truth but it's I mean ... you have a lawyer that says don't don't say the truth or will decide what the truth is that child I think the truth and if a Governor Kaine level with his own constituents should he be the governor and I think they're gonna they they said they want to wait to move for impeachment after session\nI don't think that'll hold I think Republican women like Marcia ... and they're like Cathy Conway I\nThink Diane Franklin is totally flipped our position and there's going to be for we're not going to vote on procedural motions with the Republicans until you make serious steps to get rid of this governor the Democratic leaders that it shouldn't be five weeks it should be five minutes from now I I don't understand how you could read that report\nAnd not have your mouth aghast and not say this person should I'm not saying he should go to jail I don't know that I'm saying that anybody would have a conscience as they should not be the governor of Missouri\nInteresting is uh John deal\nResigned after the text messages were came to light of him sexting and testing inappropriate comments a ... a step down a lot of people who have sort of been caught up in some level two\nMen that had some care and concern for the state of Missouri a Mike here said it best the state of Missouri is bigger than one man it has been true from the start that no one and nothing is bigger than this man's ego\nI'm Scott with us from the Missouri times the um\n[laughter] it's we're hearing on the sex line last couple of weeks there are there are people out there\nWho still support him who say their members an apple two [laughter]\nThere is it's a conspiracy it's a witch hunt um it was consensual it was a private matter it happened before he was governor\n... how does that sound coming from drivers instead of\nI think maybe the ... there's probably\nSo they had a caucus yesterday before this came out and they present it to their members I Would say you had [noise] maybe it doesn't add up a hundred and Seventeen who said well you know\nThere's some technical issues we should wait and see there's a court case and then you had five or six that were like I don't care what he does on with their ... and all the way into the basement\nUm the vast majority of the ... was not there they're not gonna they're not going to let them do that a Todd Richardson in all honesty might be the most honorable person to ever be the speaker of the house\nHe was very slow this taking a long time where this this story broke the state of the state January night her sitting here in the middle April now he went very methodically this community took forty days\nFrankly most of the report is what they took from her statement in the first week\nUh I think that there are some that will they'll find technical reasons again you've got people that are hunting for jobs you have people that are tight with different consultants it it it is scary to go against these people I can they they they hit back I can tell you firsthand right\nUm but it's you go home how you go to church and looks hey you know your daughter in the eye Goldman and explain to your wife\nWhile you support this being in the highest office in the state of Missouri [noise] if you can do that you got a bigger than me and McGraw as you can see I got a pretty good sized got a came down and politically oh God yes uh\nI I don't know that he could get elected president alliance club ... and you know here's the thing if he would have when this came out or even you know ... when he when he actually got charge\nInstead of saying oh this is Kim Gardner and scale a tour and cobra commander and was a Soros\nAll picking on poor little me if he does it you know what I Need to focus on my family and my trial I'm going to step aside a I'm going to go away my sense is that the problem with some of these things die down this reports never out and there's people that even like myself that were critics said well at least in the end\nHe cared something about the state he had something bigger than himself\nAfter he sat there and they won't you won't even call the speaker of the house back ... years been trying to call in to tell him to talk to him about this I don't know what that conversation was going to unfold but he's tried to call them back\nIt's no now I mean after that after this if you can get elected than I'd be shocked if my state's\nThe governor and know what was in this report was given a look at least he did just that he loved it but the thing I don't know if they are already here where they were before the rest of us are like I say\nI don't think it well I don't think he did but I Know this will a break a little news right here on the air uh there was a deposition for the for the guy in question\nAnd at that deposition there was an unreal jak the transcript of his of his testimony before the house committee now the house committees telling me they didn't give it to him so one member of that committee had to give that unproductive copy out to the criminal the sex crimes attorneys over doubt Bennett\nAnd so he knew what was in what she said you have to think if they gave the guys the same whoever gave what every member of that committee gave him that gave him the woman's so they knew what\nWas that there's other backup say this in four years yeah it is that um the deposition for the husband\nYou're saying what's going on ... yes yes and that doubt Bennett had a copy of his report or his deposition from the committee and Jeffrey's incidents exactly what I'm saying is unrated acted so somebody from the committee had to give out Bennett that deposition before he was released republic\nAnd a Andrew Card and I'm Mr ... want him to signed paperwork\nYou were there you are the acting attorney general what do you remember about that story and have you ever had a chance to talk with um attorney general Ashcroft about that story\n[noise] well I remember it vividly it because it felt both unreal and a moment of incredible pressure he was in\nA very serious medical condition in intensive care to hospital in Washington and they came to try and get him to sign off on a program that the Justice Department had concluded didn't have adequate lawful basis\nAnd tea shocked me John Ashcroft as a person I admired before this and I came to admire him even more afterwards he pushed himself up on his elbows and gave them a blast and explain why what they were doing was inappropriate and then fell back and pointed at me and said but that doesn't matter because I'm not the attorney general there's the attorney general\nAnd it was an extraordinary moment that demonstrated even under in great pain and desperately hill the character of that person and so yes I've talked to him about it and I write about it in the book to trying to illustrate because that's what the book is about how you make and try to make good decisions in extraordinarily difficult situations and do them in an ethical way\nYou you threatened to quit did you not\nActually I never threatened to quit\nI told the president that because I didn't like that when people set up and take my ball and go home if I don't get my way I've always thought you should make your best case and if you can't you're not comfortable saying then leave\nBut I told the president that direct then director Mueller was going to resign which was true and that that got President Bush focused on it and and uh he President Bush directed a change in the way we were doing things\nInteresting and that's all that's that's in this book as well you go into detail with that here\nYep sure do and tell a lot of stories like that in the book some of the book a small part is about Donald Trump my interactions with him but despite what you've seen in the media actually the book is about something much broader than that\nThe book is called a higher loyalty truth lies and leadership this morning President Trump tweeted out that you were not fired because of the phony Russia investigation and why do you think James Comey you were let go [noise]\nWell I thought until today that I took him at his word he told Lester Holt during an interview a year ago that he was thinking about Russia when he fired me\nAnd then I saw a news accounts that he told the Russians in a private meeting in the oval office that now that he had fired me that had relieve great pressure so I don't know what he's doing saying something that contradicts that and so I don't know what to make of it [noise]\nUm okay uh you said with George Stephanopoulos and ... and you said other places that ... going back even the criticism you I've received from the the things you did that you would still do it the same way\nAnd that's because you want it to legitimize and I'm paraphrasing here Hillary Clinton's presidency if she wins and you were under the assumption she was going to win once you have acted differently\nIf you thought it was a closer race or if you thought\nDonald Trump was was going to win\nNo in fact I I say in the book and this is something that people have misunderstood\nThat intentionally did not consider where the polls were and one of my people ask me whether I should consider that what I'm doing may help elect Donald Trump and I said no not for a moment because down that path lies the death of the FBI is an independent organization I Can't consider it what I'm asking the book and cross examining myself is\nSo was there an implicit assumption given that the whole world but Hillary Clinton was going to be elected president and the answer is sure that's possible maybe even likely\nBut it wouldn't change the decision I still had to crappy options to choose from\nBut one was much worse than the other no matter what the polls said I could speak about something or I could hide something from the American people while hiding something from the American people basically lying to them is never the right answer and so I'd have spoken no matter who was going to be the next president\nThe emails on I'm Anthony wiener is a laptop why not investigate that first find out if those are different emails and then say something why say you're opening it up before you knew what was on the laptop\nYeah that's a that's a really good question and a reasonable person might have decided to take the chance\nTo investigate a little and see what you have\nThe reason that didn't make sense to me is\nThat first of all the the investigators were telling me there's hundreds of thousands of emails on Anthony Clinton's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop including possibly the missing emails from her first three months the secretary of state which run a different domain and we can't possibly review these before the election there's just too many\nAnd so do you wait given that and then there's another consideration we'd had a problem with leaks\nWhat if it leaks out the friday before the election that you've been doing this secretly in some ways\nThat's worse if worst can be imagined that's worse and so my judgment is that would not be a smart move but I could also see people seem to\n[noise]\nThis is the best of ... live in the morning here is ... on\nThe executive director of a study that came out called\nMissouri twenty thirty Ted welcome back big five fifty ...\nThis was developed by the Missouri department or the excuse me the Missouri chamber foundation on and it ... what was the goal of this study what did you what what what did you want to look at\nIt or talking about the workers are trying to make it easier for people over\nThe number one issue here talking to businesses big and small tech companies regular companies restaurants you name it the number one issue businesses have today is that they can find qualified workers\nAgree with you we hear that all over the country are everywhere we study businesses are looking for people that still be productive individual the jobs bill\nIs it because the jobs are menial labor and Americans quote unquote don't like to do those jobs is it is it they're tech jobs that they don't have the skills for what's the what's the underlying problem there\nWas one thing but it's not just the job that will still now we're seeing drivers mechanics well they\nWant the job well we just figured skills\nSo these are these are good paying jobs\nBut she was six figure jobs them any good job\nAnd you would think that supply and demand right would sort of\nWould think that the supply and demand right would sort of feel that problem over a number of years\nBut if there was a lot of issues that come with this we have a lot of baby boomers the labor market so a lot of people with skills overtime or leaving\nYoung people are moving into the markets but to change the industries and jobs today make it harder for people to know what they should be\nStudying do what they should be or then you have jobs that are moving around\nThe country around the state of Missouri so where did I find a job the R B that active those skills and find a job but I'm looking for the study tries to do a lot of this one different acts of\nThe state of Missouri needs to take sector or try to better job of making that point they\nTend to how much of it is there just aren't the bodies were not a growing population\nIt's a big issue or years ago everybody in America and everybody on the story was about quality dispatch to steal but at the job market high unemployment has ranged\nAlmost historical was a country of the people there were having babies these days we were before the\nSupply demand it's a real real testified the people you're getting Missouri specifically attracting and keeping people in the states that have good skill is a real issue the planet addresses that about trying to retain and attract\nI Know there I can hear them screaming at the radio right now McGraw asked him about tech schools vocational schools schools great and it's great to learn\nFrench and Latin and about the great Gatsby about Scott Fitzgerald but we're not teaching them skills that employers need so where did the high schools getting into all this\nSchool have to be there in fact it's dark joke with your parents when you're born and how they teach you schools are part of it were high school for more rare occasion but you can't give up everything when you go to Puerto ... people\nWith basic academic skill they want people were still people with the skills are merging and more than anything else you know what's going to hear from reporters is that what you
