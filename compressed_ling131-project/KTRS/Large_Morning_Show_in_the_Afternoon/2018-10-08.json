people see it and uh but\nBut television is really like it's kind of like ... it's just more fun to do because at the town I really enjoy it\nYou know recently did you hear me he was just doing standup comedy and he said to me because you get on the interview\nPlenty of people yeah you'd\nBe looking to do standup comedy and we know from TV shows new actors and they go All right your your

ever be\nPerfectly France question probably not going to the trickle out I really don't have any interest in doing stand up um I I Do it it's a it's a tough thing to do to stand up alone\nUm I've been very very lucky uh you know just be content to work as an actor so uh I don't I don't really I really like working with other actors too I mean that's another thing um they you know the old quote is acting as reacting and a lot of it is true you know uh\nFor me to have the opportunity to work with another actor would just make me that I you know the actress but I'm working with right now getting mixed and it's just so much fun to work with why would I take myself out of that situation\nUm and you know the minute you leave town if you go to the ... ... it's it's harder for you to get other work I'm no probably not going to end up doing stand up stuff and you know it's just nothing I'm particularly interested in I don't know what I Would like\nTo I don't know what my act would be either

happens\nSo if you're unpleasant to work with um you know because you're on camera nobody knew anything and somebody can do your voice and a second but on camera and some people that don't get successful\nUm usually for a short period of time that are unpleasant to work with 'em and your chemistry with them and it's when the acting really can do the best you can do to make it work for the people that there were no never do that you don't like each other and never do that you have an argument right before you started shooting\nIt does it does happen I mean it's unfortunate that it is a
