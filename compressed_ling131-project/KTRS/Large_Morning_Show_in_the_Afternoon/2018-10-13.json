or no hung out there to talk with you we're now providing smart solutions for seniors and an open forum for older adults with important questions about their future\nAttorney CPA Joe ... down\n\nFrom donor talk this is Joe Cornell and with me today Susan Arthur soon as I think the show that we have lined up today is a little different and it really is the next step of what we've been doing for a long time we've been talking a lot about\nIssues that are raised and water and the rules and and water the conditions and qualifications to be able to qualify for benefits to understand\nInsurance long term care issues\nUh probate issues estate planning stuff et cetera\nThings that are of interest to our clientele and we assume that those of you listening are sixty years old plus and so we try to focus on things that have practical value in your lives and today is about that practicality tell us we're going to talk about specifically well\nToday we're going to put it all into practice you know it's easy to listen to these terms each week and to share power of attorney and durable power of attorney and advanced healthcare\nThese terms each week into the air power of attorney and durable power of attorney and\nAdvanced health care directive things and so we thought\nToday we're not going to have you glaze over those terms or glass that were the terms what we're going to do is we're going to give you some practical example of questions that Joe gets every single day in his practice he runs across them with lots and lots of different people real life examples of when you need to have these things and why\nAnd that's important these are actual examples known names or or knows specific details but ah but enough to give you the necessary information to appreciate what these problems involved so where shall we start\nAll right well let's start with some simple and then we'll kind of go through a few a few of them quickly and they will maybe get into some of the more complex issues All right so our homes considered assets for applying for Medicaid and does Medicaid pay for assisted living facility is we now know long term care is a big concern\nYeah yeah this this issue comes up a lot ... you have many of you have heard that a house is exempt so exempt means that it will be counted it's not accountable asset for purposes of qualifying for Medicaid and it's a matter of fact\nThat the ceiling now is pretty high I think that we're now about five hundred and fifty thousand dollars in equity a number of states have gone up to eight hundred and fifty or so thousand equity\nSo um it's not so much the problem for most people that that their house disqualifies them what bothers them is the fact that whatever benefits they get will be eventually subtract it from the house after they pass away\nOr after they move out of the house so what's the house is abandoned by banded that means simply that the Medicaid recipient has moved out and does not have either a dependent\nLiving in that house or a spouse living in that house than than Medicaid can proceed through ah through to asset recovery and asked recovers the process but which they get paid\nA and and sell those assets so or if not then then when you pass away and that's what troubles many people as the idea that that well okay maybe it doesn't stop me now from getting Medicaid but the idea that I'm going to lose my home is a problem and let me add one other thing that when you move out of the house as long as you have a\nSo he's threatening to change as well\nAs well as cut their mother out of the well\nA while now to made of our listeners we can imagine where\nI Am a circumstance like this kind of rise of the people who\nWho have Alzheimer's especially dementia generally can can get frustrated and anxious and a and B difficult so uh I Would in in a case like this I Would throw out a couple of ideas\nOne is to kind of do nothing which means I'm be prepared to establish that he's incompetent later in the end he well he made\nWould be invalid goes to the extent they have any control over his actions whatsoever then you'd have to go see a lawyer and a lawyer could not ethically prepare well for him if he is in college but now that there's some interpretation involved but it sounds like person they're describing\nWould be such that an ethical lawyer it should be a parent to him or her [noise] so that's one way to approach it is is to\nIs to postpone wait and see if it happens if it does prepare to fight it and I'm ... and that's not a ... satisfactory solution to a lot of people because it doesn't allow them sleep well now I'm Wondering what what lies ahead but\nBut that is an approach another is that they can have a guardianship declared\nA guardianship is something that you you mentioned the probate court I'm there would be a hearing there would probably be a guardian ad litem appointed to do some investigation a doctor would probably testify\nUm the the father would have an opportunity to have his own counsel he'd course would be entitled to notice in hearing all the constitutional protections that you'd expect in a hearing like that\nAnd then once there's a declaration of incompetence then of course he cannot make any changes like that [noise]\nUm but but if it's a gray area if it's not clear to what extent he really is incompetent than I can see where there is some risk here about about the possibility that he will go out and\nAnd change his estate planning in a way that that he wouldn't want just one thing if he wants to change in his right mind is saying you know I'm not happy with my daughter for whatever\nReason as long as he's lucid then he's entitled to have that opinion right but I get it I can see why the family so I just and and uh neither of those solutions is entirely satisfactory\nCouldn't be something as simple as going to their to their fathers doctor and think and what does it take to get them to say okay he is not competent to make these just isn't as it has to be a whole legal process can to doctors sign off on this and say the disease has progressed at this point\nNo because they need a court order I mean to doctors can say that\nThat's progress to this point\nNo because they need a court order I mean to doctors can say that and that will often trigger for example of power of attorney that's already been created okay where maybe the ... the father ten years ago create a power of attorney and rather than being effect immediately\nHe may have had a provision that it only comes into effect when he's declared incompetent a number of people do their powers of attorney that way\nAnd then in that case yeah if you had to doctors certified that would trigger the power of attorney\nOr however in in this case are just two doctors certifying means nothing it needs to their needs to be a gap will go down okay and what's the gamble goes down meaning a court order then suddenly there's there's authority\nOkay so it's it's not as simple as we want it to be sometimes in those really obvious situations but it obviously protects us in those situations that are not quite as obvious yeah that's\nRight well another thing that you talk a lot about we've talked a lot about on this but you have that we have some questions coming up about trust I mean and we've talked about how there was a couple of different types of trust there's ... irrevocably trust well what is the best way to make sure that the trustee follows that trust rule\nAn example we have is someone asked a question that they were getting ready to draft a trust and they have one sign so he'll be the trustee well what is the best way to make sure that he does what mom and dad want him to do\nHuh I'm Wondering if this was being asked by the grandchild of of of the parents of the\nParents they have no other relatives that says that they feel like they're starting to is the only\nThe only option that they have but they've heard some some horror stories from friends and how the trust protectors and financial managers that control the investments um they just aren't really doing exactly what they want and following the wishes of the trust now this is another\nOne of those cases where when you when the parents have suspicions and reservations that makes you as a third party think yeah there's there's probably a reason for concern because who had no more their child and the the than the parents\nBut in this case first of all let's talk about the possibility of not having their son they don't have to have their so it's a trustee at all\nYeah but the parents are that's a hard one for parents\nAnd I know and it is especially if the child will get offended um and and I talk about that a lot and it's a similar problem and they have said three kids and they're wanting to choose one to be the trustee there were locked in some also Jess with things that you have all three but it does in fact gridlock\nI'm so in this case I still want to go there for a moment and say\nYou should consider in that case not having the sun as the trustee if you have reason to doubt that he'll do the right thing in in the alternatives there's lots of alternatives there can be somebody that they know through their church\nOr somebody they trust um another would be simply to to use a institutional trustee there going to charge around one percent depend on the estate generally if you have less than a million dollars in total value or you might pay more than one percent you might pay one and a half percent but\nSome people think oh that's awful at one and a half percent\nBut others and and I tend to be among they say that's reasonable in other words if you think about what you're getting for that the um and so people are staying as one percent of the total the scope assets under management so whatever the assets are you're telling them to manage\nA van then that's a a a rough are all about say one and a half so it'll be two percent when you get as low as\nSay five hundred thousand dollars um they really make their money on larger numbers as you can imagine you do the math and you figure out what one person is and you can see how much they're making and you can see also where it's not profitable for eye bank or trust department\nOr to to with a brokerage firm to accept a lot of counts with money very low\nSo for those listeners who are above say five hundred thousand dollars and I know a lot of you are these days I mean if you if you're even around a million dollars including your house that's that's ... clearly within middle class um\nBut but those of you who want to consider that a stick it out there because you have professionals involved and you have insurance so they make a bad decision you know there's some way to get recovery of money I mean if your brother in law or the sun or whatever\nGoes out and makes a bad decision however well intentioned or bad intentions mhm doesn't matter it's gone and unless they have asked us to recover from and typically these people don't that there's just no recourse\nAlso you have to be a professional management mean they're going to make wise decision about the investments so you have the insurance piece you have lawyers involved his lawyers worked for these institutions are going to be sure they don't follow the law\nAnd and you have professional investors so I'm a big fan of of considering institutional trustees even when you're not rich even when you're not rich but you do need to be a I'd argue above that five hundred thousand dollar threshold I'm\nNow at alternatives lock a lawyer I I mean I'm I'm very reluctant to play this role with clients I just prefer not to be a a trustee but\nBut some lawyers do and um and if it's somebody that they know and trust\nUm it's probably better than just the average Joe I mean certainly the lawyer knows the law\nUm and and they do have some recourse in terms of liability so you have malpractice insurance you have some recourse if things go wrong or sideways you have the ethical rules a you know lawyers can lose their can can lose the right to practice law you do have checks and balances with a lawyer that that you don't have just anybody\nI'm so I'm throwing those ideas out there but that I consider that but if they're going to have their son let's stick with that because that maybe what they're stuck with\nWell and I think it's important to remind people that even if you don't have your relative all your time to be the trustee it's not that they're out of the well they still have the assets and things like that you're still leaving everything to them or have the ability to leave things to them they just don't manage to ...\nAnd that's the reason you're here or one of the many reasons of course is that is that you know I Would assume people would know that and you raise a point that I'm thinking that many don't whenever I was saying that we're talking about trustee we're talking about the management\nAnd not the beneficiary so Susan Point out\nOr you can definitely benefit the sun the sun can be the sole beneficiaries imagine what the intent probably um at least after they're gone right after they're gone that's why they worry about the about jumping into that role before\nUm but but that has nothing to do with the trustee the trustee is simply to figure that manages to all my listeners\nDon't think trust her this complicated a complex thing that you have to have a law degree to understand a trust is very very simple\nAnd that's one reason it's been around for five hundred years is it simply means that you you transfer an asset to someone who was a trustee and you're giving them legal title\nBut they don't but they're not getting what's called beneficial title which means they're not the one who's intended to benefit so you're simply a set lord of the person creating the trust that just parents here and if those you listen if you decide to do that you'd be called a set lower\nYou can read invoices without it [noise]\nYou can't bring status reports spreadsheets do that are of or

S. news real news never\nYou're listening to talk with Joe ... down everybody right solutions for seniors predicted like redound planting partners your ... but now attorney CPA joke or down\nOver\n... ... we're back with elder talk or Susan we're working through these questions that we commonly hear a commonly here especially through my practice some that originated there and others you obtained from others so let's go to the next question\nOkay this deals with daily living as some of the difficulty thing difficult things in daily letting my dad had a stroke and that led to lots of speech and mild to mention that he can't communicate the right words but he seems to be able to understand things although he does forget things\nWell before his stroke you put this child I Know I guess I don't know if it's male or female but I'm On a bank account to manage I'm paying its bills he's also the beneficiary in his life insurance and annuities\nDoes he still need a power of attorney or something more officials I think I Know what you're going to say\nYeah yeah you do um\nI did yes he definitely need to power of attorney\nUm and as we talked about before I mean there are these various bullet solutions meaning these these one off um\nArrangements that you solve a particular problem with but it's just sloppy and it's often inconsistent and you sometimes have one asset working against goals for another asset\nUm uh it's much simpler to to sink in strategic terms I keep using that word because I think you all understand what that means I mean strategic means looking at the big picture and coming up with solutions that are consistent with the big picture\nAnd and that will result and you're being able to keep more of your money you spend less lawyer fees and court costs and taxes and other things are so the nice thing about solutions like we talked before the break about\nUh advantages of a trust a similar argument can be made in strategic terms about ... power of attorney that reason durable power of attorney and trust off and work hand in glove because they they complement each other\nAnd in this case will just talk about the durable power of attorney as a solution it sounds like the father is still is still confident purposes of creating a power of attorney confidence from the legal from the ... laws perspective is not a\nA single diagnosis or a single standard rather it's a standard that varies with the subject matter if you're engaged in a complicated contract\nThan the standard is higher than for example for doing your state planning suing your state planning it's a low standard\nInterestingly enough it's a very low standard for marriage I Would I Would argue that maybe they should reverse those and raise the bar a marriage but the whole idea is that\nThe law watched to accommodate even the very feeble mentally\nTo engage in certain transactions and ... and so they the law will stretch to accommodate these people for a purpose for those fundamental things like marriage so those fundamental things lock estate planning but for a complicated for contract et cetera than there will want to see more clarity on part of that person so in this case\nGiven the scripture and you guys have\nMild dementia understands what said but aphasia means you can't speak can't speak so so that that doesn't affect competence right so to the extent that that person it sounds ... signed a durable power of attorney\nThat that would be sufficient and that would allow that would allow this person if it's properly drafted would allow this child to have access to all those accounts and to be able to use them all in a in a way that benefits their dad primarily it's a primary goal and then secondarily preserves assets\nI another question again with and dealing with these daily living types of things is um [noise] we had someone who is asked the question is as if I become my mom's guardian and let her we may never home and I responsible for actions because they're considering guardian set for their\nThey never home and I responsible for actions because they are considering guardian set for their eighty seven year old mother who has again my arguments that these mental issues keep coming around they're they're just kind of growing and\nIn ... frequency she's been advised by her doctor that she doesn't she shouldn't be saying quite by herself and says his daughter is worried about if mom goes out and hurt someone and drives and hit someone with their car and she then responsibilities or guardian\nYeah this is a tough question because it comes up a lot and comes up in another context or two and that's when people um are ed children often are admitting apparent into a nursing home and they're asked to sign documents\nSo let me first uh address the with the power of attorney which kind of dovetails with what we're talking about while ago a power of attorney\nUm as long as you're acting on behalf of the other person and and you're performing that you're ... Sherry duty then you're not going to be personally liable for acting in that role or if it's an abusive that duty then of course but but\nNow I generally speaking you don't have to worry about liability in that role\nA similar thing if you're a guardian a and a guardian is somebody who was appointed by court now that doesn't mean by way of a power of attorney if somebody is a call to conserve it or or a guardian\nThan there is somebody who's been appointed by judge that's about as official as you can get a gamble gone down after hearing and and the court has declared the you occupy this role and you have the authority\nConservator ship refers to authority over assets and guardianship refers to authority over person meaning their care where they live at cetera\nSo those things are related but they can be two people it's not unusual to have somebody who's really strong in the financial side to be the conservative on someone very different for a guardianship but they can be the same and quite frankly they often are the same I'm\nSo whenever you have somebody who's been appointed a guardian than than it it is a different standard as long as they're acting that role a guardian they can expect to be protected from liability\nThey're clearly acting on behalf of that person only within abuse of that role would they be subject to ability now let me speak though specifically to the issue about\nNegligent and trust that many of you many of us know who have had teenage kids that that we've heard these horror stories about parrots being sued because her kid gets out and and and it's driving crazy it was one killed her are seriously hurt that's called negligent and trust but\nI Want to make sense to you as the term implies that means that\nWhen you have a parrot that knows that this kid is as out drinking alcohol and is a\nWild and crazy kid and then handsome an automobile to go out with I think many of us can step back and say okay it's reasonable that a person who loses their daughter because of that son's condition would say to the parents why did you and trust that vehicle to that child a\nBut absent those extraordinary circumstances simply because you allow your child to drive your car or you liable no no not simply because you allow a responsible child to drive your car you're not automatically liable it's negligent and trust but not in trust my\nNegligent trust so take that concept to the situation that we're talking about here and\nIt's the same thing it's true that if you if you're the guardian and you allow this person\nTo to do things that result harmed others in that you're negligence and yeah you might be potentially liable you sometimes you have to post a bond to the court even when you're in a place in this position so you will have insurance often well a company that it's not unusual to have that posted with the appointment\nAll right so we talked at the beginning about Medicaid and still let's kind of circle back around and go back to a few more questions 'cause that's again something Medicare ... is it is\nAll right is a change in beneficiary on an IRA considered a gift by medicate we talked about that sixteen months we'll look back period and all of those things\nAre good news is on beneficiaries or you can do that with abandon\nWith reckless abandon although I don't encourage you to do what ... or or any sort of abandoned\nThis is a big five fifty K. C. R. S. St Louis\nWhy aren't we all we can rely on what he looks look look don't challenge our chance to help make Missouri safer save more lives dot com takes little book alone don't challenge today\nIt's still buckled down challenge today [noise]\nNow at least I don't care\nFor the first time ever doing football is an Brian any stadium and if you're going to do it you might as well go all out and it's under the light and tell them coming in and\nThe number one ranked team in the country and Alabama ... Mayfield with me here in Columbia Mo Jackson Weaver running things that we feel headquarters in Jefferson City Barry owed them give his first impressions on the setting and the game tonight in a sack right now it's like the tigers Kelly Mike how you doing today I'm well Brett how are you\nDoing All right thank you Tuscaloosa is not new to you personally you had a daughter who went to the school at Alabama but for tiger fans who have not made the trap what makes that venue on an Alabama football game day special well\nYou know first of all the crowd the historical traditions that they have here are the folks will get a chance to see throughout the course of the game tonight I'm you know really the welcoming these environments to said visiting fans notice and I'll tell you that spreads\nThere are a lot of Missouri fans that made the trip so close to for this game of you know we got into town yesterday morning at\n... and so I'll just say a lot of people around child was certainly today too so it's so there there are a lot of a lot of black and gold but we'll see in the audience tonight but Autor two thousand fans to push the sold out and it'll be a fun environments to say the least unless the\nScheduling format changes the only going to get to go there once every you know twelve years or so so certainly can't blame to do than for making the most of that the last week was a little bit of a bummer at elite at South Carolina law but at the end after a long lightning delay the mindset been like for the team on the flight to tea down in Birmingham and in the hotel\nWell I haven't been with the team I drove myself [noise] ah so I have not been in I I I stayed in touch loser there in Birmingham as you mentioned a you know and so I get a very old among Thursday night or during soccer so I was a very impressed with just all locked in his team was throughout the course of the week how they uh you know learning from the university learn from mistakes and learning how to\nUtilize ah what happened and correct it and move forward so you have to be\nYou have to be a really good tonight in and really every facet of the game of\nYou know in order to try and pull off what would be the biggest upsets college football the season\nThe tigers Kelly with us on the arrive alive tiger tailgate I listen to this pod cast a couple of months ago it was called origins any kind of went into how the tide started this latest round of dominance underneath data one story that stuck out the new players run sixteen hundred and ten yards Brent in that stadium in the heat on the first day of conditioning\nThey catch so sad to do it without bending over even the whole time former line the Barrett Jones said they wound up in his class doing twenty eight\nIn his first year I just thought like that to the culture and the mindset they also try to build down there you know there is a great\nBook to the to fill the average who used to do the color analysts working on the Crimson Tide radio network with Eli Gold whose son politically for years uh towards the goal every day the in the relentless pursuit of excellence\nOf who's been able to book and it's really good reason 'cause it talks about this program um the coach saving has handled here and how they follow it and she said actually scientists or\nThat he spent a with fuel cell a check back in the Cleveland Brown days and so it was really interested in reading it or college football fan I think you probably enjoy it and and I think if you're a business person too because this auction detail about\nLeaving in the new structure believing in me and you didn't what you do on the program standpoint and then [noise] and then sticking with the with the sticking with the the other thing that's interesting too is that [noise]\nYou know if you if you look at what they're doing and how they have evolved as a as an off into football to just go back to two thousand four team wins\nAlabama made it a visit to Columbia, Missouri to get into the war and the weather delays impacted that day but it was forty two Thirteen file but they were they were basically to ... to ... which is try to calm the rock now what they have done is that they have become a football team that passes\nTo set up to run again that's completely against which uh they used to do years ago when coach said one was a you know either at LSU earlier here Alabama or even a machine said back in the day so it just it just I think speaks volume so [noise]\nDo choose to evolve and how coaches can can change things to you know meet the needs to go what's taking place in the game in the modern day\nAnd even more recently than that I could go back to the national championship game last year having the courage at halftime\nGo away from the very successful quarterbacking jailing hurts to to a ton of Iowa and now it's going to buy low as a starter and even another orbit ... news happy than not so much that may not going to be a a match up that do have to at least from a competitive and had a chance\nTo write you got to be fun to believe sound and and that's something that they've been in a you know really working on and you look at the Georgia game had a really cool you know six plays in that game that I told the difference curry breakdowns on the on the defensive side from a passing game standpoint and then last week I caught a break down some final drive\nIt impacted your but we didn't win the game of South Carolina so yeah Missouri has got to be much better not only in the back out again the tigers are going to figure out a way to be able to get pressure on the quarterback because\nOne thing about a hundred by what was it was not only does he doesn't have an unbelievably strong Mormon accredited\nClinic really she is so terribly accurate posts all I mean it's it really is amazing to watch your\nBilling the ball and a half would release who are\nSeeking what the the tigers Kelly here on the arrive alive tiger tailgate Barry owed them will be joining us\nInside Bryant Denny stadium momentarily and you know one thing one big positive I think really all year long night for the
