now for over fifty years I have spent many days taking my four children sledding on one of those snowy days I remember watching my children's fly down a hill with no apparent concern for potential bodily harm\nAs I watch them a dawned on me how risking our money in our use is so similar to risking our bodily health\nFor example when we were young we had no problem going to a sledding hill and launching off the top of it was a little to no thought of consequences once we have kids we still might go to the top of the hill but we will probably slow down with a little bit more caution\nThen later on in life most of us that we won't even go to the top of the hill\nThe reason for this as simple as we get older the ability for our bodies to absorb physical punishment is decreased\nAnd that time it takes to recover is increased the same is true for money when we were young we could absorb huge losses in our retirement money because of the time period available to recover was long we had a lot of time in front of us to recoup\nHowever when we get close to retirement there is little to no time to recover from losses\nThe no market rich strategies I work with allow you to slow down the hill in a crash proof sled you still get to participate in the fun but without any market risk\n[noise] so do you want to be crash proof you know we all for all of our listeners a free retirement

called a financial illustration well you probably have and you just don't know what you see when you go to a financial planner that isn't a business or risking your money they might use the computer software to run examples of what could happen to your money\nSometimes these examples are based on historical data as sometimes they're just flat out hysterical I had a client the other day that showed me an illustration from their broker that demonstrate a what would happen to their money if it continued to grow over the next ten years and a twelve percent compound a growth\nWhere financial planners and yet the nerve to even print that on paper what is even crazier is that I have never seen an illustration from one of these brokers that shows what happens to a class money if they wake up one day and fifty percent of it is gone\nWhy not cutting it happened\nYou better can in fact some of you today might be in that very same situation is so easy for financial sales people to show you the best possible results and then just to be fair show you some moderate losses on these illustrations\nI think every financial professional should be required to show their prospect of class what the worst result was from the clients I manage\nLet me ask you if you are thinking about working with a financial planner and you find out that they had lost fifty percent of our clients retirement funds would you want to work with them\nWell now that I brought it up you're probably thinking the very same question about me have I lost any of my clients money well the answer is one hundred

and are living very comfortably and their golden years well how do they do that\nWell it's called passive residual income now passed the residual income is money that comes to you every single month

market like returns without market risk and reduce or eliminate the fees\nAnd throw away any of the worrying knowing that your retirement money is safe and growing so call us at eight for four or five one three seven to three three\nWe've talked about how the real risk of exposure to the market is not discussed in the media or by brokers we use no market risk strategy is based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to ten percent or more\nInclude contractual guarantees that you'll never suffer a loss because of stock market declines while locking in your yearly games and also know fees are lows taken from your deposits\nYou see this message is different from what you normally would here on other financial shows\nLargely because our concepts are different most brokers based or financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divides up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops well the one thing that has really talked about is that it also limits your games when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could participate in some other market gangs but without participating in any of the market losses\nYou see our emphasis is on preservation of your principal participation and market gains in a lifetime of income that you cannot outlive will help you set up a retirement that you can be sure of\nMarkets always retest new lows but when the market goes into the next dive it won't matter to you once you've ... the volatility of markets you'll be smiling knowing that you're hard earned money is one hundred percent safe from any and all market

income maximize strategy that allows you to build up an income account that compounds at up to seven and a half percent now this account can be used to guarantee you will never outlive your retirement money\nYou see when you suffer a loss in the market even a small loss you know three problems\nThe loss value is just one problem the second problem is the time it takes to make back that loss but the third problem is is it is almost impossible for you to regained your losses so let me explain I'm going to be using a lot of numbers now so stay with me\nIf you have a market exposed account of one hundred thousand dollars and the market drops by thirty percent your town has dropped to Seventy thousand dollars\nVery painful right but that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the next year by that thirty percent well are you back to your original one hundred thousand dollars no not at all why well because after dropping\nNo not at all why\nWell because after dropping thirty percent the account is now at Seventy thousand dollars so the thirty percent gain is again on Seventy thousand\nSo thirty percent of Seventy thousand is Twenty one thousand so the Twenty one thousand dollars gain added to the Seventy thousand is now Ninety One thousand dollars [noise]\nShe said it would take a forty three percent gain to get you back to where we started which was a hundred thousand dollars [noise]\nSee that's why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my listeners as this one does negative thirty plus forty three equals zero\nWell the answer is when you lose thirty percent in the market and that takes forty three percent game just to get back to zero [noise] the other question I like to ask is this one does negative thirty equals zero\nOh the answer is when you are my client\nThat's because my clients have no possibility of market losses ever\nSo you never have to worry about trying to regain losses also upfront bonuses of up to ten percent when you begin your account\nAnd a guaranteed lifetime income account that is contractually guaranteed to grow up to seven and a half percent per year for income purposes\nIf any of this is

they're not successful right they're they're they're busy they're successful doing what they what it is they do but to get to that next level how did they get out of their comfort zone\nWell you gotta you gotta say well what do you want and I think a lot of people think that I'm\nJust being okay with being okay as what they want but I I think when you step back and say what do I really want what do I what am I missing what am I really stretching for that allows you to open your mind and then to get outside of your comfort zone I think it's doing little things\nYou know I was in Whistler Canada last week and I was talking to my wife while bungee jumping I don't think that's what you want to think about those big scary\nOr getting outside our comfort zone how do you really just stretch it a little bit and that's a behavior change one on one small steps and thinking every single day what are you doing to stretch yourself to push yourself to get outside of your comfort zone maybe it's not that big scary scariest thing or a phobia that you have\nMaybe it's just maybe making extra phone call or reaching out to somebody that you don't think's going to call you back that could be the little\nStuff that pushes you out of your comfort zone so that you can keep stretching and that's you know I think that will lead the conversation today is I think many people are kind of after their maximum capacity\nAnd I think most people when I was reading about the VA loans or earlier it said one out of three people that are eligible don't even know they're eligible and don't even know about the VA loans there's no\nDoubt about that we talked to people all the time um that I don't know they're eligible for several reasons um\nBut a ... a lot of people who don't think they are eligible I've had that exact same situation haven't happened multiple times over the years where somebody calls me and I asked everybody have you ever served in the military yeah but not enough time or or they don't know if they were had enough time um\nAnd they don't think they're going to be a Muslim but we like I said can find out just a couple of minutes whether or not they can't\nTalk to you about the property tax exemptions when that comes to VA loans ... absolutely and and this is for us is far el annoy people um\nBut in Illinois if you are a retired veteran and you have a disability that is considered by the VA Seventy percent or more your property\nTaxes in the state of Illinois and those are the those of us that live in the state of Illinois I Know that this is a big deal here property taxes are zero you do not pay one dime for property taxes so it's a huge advantage\nFor people that are served in the military and are considered Seventy percent or more disabled and and luckily we

about eating [noise]\nWhy is that important and how do I get better than going through the ah [noise] you know the Mexican joined today and having some chicken fajitas and a handful of chips and salsa water by the way not soda so that was good you know when I'm traveling it's it's funny I I have really\nGood discipline of I pick the food I'm going to eat for the performance that I Want\nSo what I mean by that as I Am thinking about the future outcome of what I'm going to feel like after eating when I'm On the road traveling speaking and I have to perform I think for many of us we don't think about the future outcome\nWe think about our temptation of taste what sounds the best what do I really want to eat right now you know that's usually going to be a cheeseburger or treaters with cheese or tacos all those things sound really good\nBut if you're really trying to make some conscious effort around how do I fuel my body we got to think about the outcome versus how we see all the time 'cause if you go hungry to a restaurant or to a grocery store you're going to make some poor poor choices so you know it comes down to this question\nThat I get all the time what are people starving for lacking in their life what is the number one answer what if people want more of\nA I Would say time but the energy\nYeah time more everybody wants more time\nMy argument is that it really time without the proper energy is is is not very is not what you're looking for what everyone's ... yeah we're looking for more energy more sustained energy and natural food is and so if we really make it simple how do we get energy it's from food\nAnd so when we're going to make choices or if we're looking for more energy we really want to fuel or body with\nGood good food and now I'm a human being I have this guy's golf trip this weekend\nI'm not going to put the best food in my body this weekend because I'm not worried about that at the time right and that's called the eighty twenty we're all happened that balance having that sustainability but your question to me is how do we see all the body can think about you know there's a balance of eighty twenty eighty good\nTwenty don't worry about as much but throughout the week maybe you know you have Monday Tuesday Wednesday is important Thursday you can kind of slack and then friday try to finish the week\nYou think of those days of days that I'm going to go out for lunch and I'm going to fuel my body and then on Thursday I'm going to go have something that I really really am are you looking forward to want to eat that's where we have to change your mindset on because I Want people to enjoy food but\nI also want them to ... ... it's what gives us energy and if we're not putting the right fuel and it's going to neglect us from what I think it's our most precious commodity which is energy\nSolar die back in this lunch again because maybe people deal with the same thing I deal with so I you know I could have gone to like one restaurant and got my favorite wings nah nope not doing that because I Want to eat better so I\nGet to grilled chicken put some salsa on their put some ... quite a bit of walk on there and some beans on there right so when you hear that like for me I saw myself on that that's a good choice right that's a good meal versus getting the burger or the wings or whatever so walk us through what Magic Johnson does\nMotivator ... the er the gym I can see across the interstate from my office on January twelfth it's you know packed by February first it's like the park in an empty again and\nAgain it motivation is a crazy thing um [noise] we have a lot of excuses we we create a lot of\nThings that aren't really there but at the end of the day is that how do we create these habits because if they become rituals it really takes no energy and I don't know if my father talked about energy activation but energy activation of super\nPowerful more energy it takes to do something the less likely we are to do it [noise] and so if we could create a ritual of exercise for me it's such a ritual it's really not that much energy I I was on vacation and in Canada last week and [noise] it's just such a ritual it doesn't take any\nEffort to planet to know what to do that takes time and that's why sometimes these short contests are great but along the way you better be building habits for else it's really going to be tough to sustain it long\nAnd that's what you're saying is if you haven't created maybe that habit what to do you make it a little less energy this is ... with circular success will

or actually hear a lot of this now the big craze right is everyone wants to achieve more with less [noise] you talk to us about that almost like a tired of hearing it right\nBut it's so true but so many people want to do it for the here's the truth we're doing less with more yeah and that's that that I think hurts people you know when I speak I say that and sometimes I see people in people's eyes they said\nThey're hurt because they're thinking they're working hard and I'm working hard I you know I I'm busy I don't have any more time and the reality is we have so many more bells and whistles and technology and resources and\nWe shouldn't be so much more efficient than we are but the research is telling us there are a fish and sea productivity has flat line the last Twenty years and that's the graph in our book about capacity for the first time technology is outpacing humans from a capacity standpoint\nYou know we have we got our our fingertips and where\nWe have way more in our fingertips and so everything that we've created technology software related was to make it our lives and more efficient and I would kinda argue we haven't actually caught up to how to use those tools the right way you know you talked about the addiction of social media or heard\n... technology in general um we're not using those tools how they were originally intended and that's what causes us to feel like we're doing more with less yeah but we're actually doing less or more in every organization\nThinks they're trying to do less with more but they have to realize the key is how do you actually do more with more because we have more\nRight at our fingertips right so let's talk about you for personally in your business lived for life in general what what have you learned about failure\nI again I I opened up with ah my story of failure and I had an opportunity to give a Fifteen minute talk to my past school or the five hundred student athletes and I just said you know I feel many many times and when I was in their shoes\nI thought failure was the worst thing possible I think anybody that's [noise]\nYou know driven internally you know just wants to be successful others and\nAnybody that's [noise] you know driven internally you know just wants to be successful whether it's in business or have hobbies or passion or family they think the opposite of successes failure\nWhat I learned along the way as actually failure accepting it allows you to ... that that peak\nOpportunity of success and so for me I uh I lost my golf game early in college you know as a huge failure I did crummy in school I got a six or a sixteen the first time I took the ACTs Eighteen the second time I mean ... that's\n... extremely low but along the way what I learned is I have control\nSee for a long time I saw all those failures worse somebody else's fault or didn't matter or\nI needed someone else to help me to find ... define who I was a but in reality it it was me learning that I have complete control over whatever I Want and I think in our world where we're always blaming are comparing herself to others when we can tap into that internal voice and say\nHey you know I felt there I got to do better it's you know taking the blame of pain maybe it is not necessarily your fault but you have control over changing the outcome the next time that so comforting once you learn that natural failures Tommy is\nWe have so much more control as humans than we think um that when you allow yourself to think that way it makes it actually easier\nI think what you're saying right here is my next question for you is give me about you know the the the one thing to your core that I couldn't shake for me writing so mine would be choice choices\nI should say because I I Know every day I get a wake up and I get to choose my attitude I get to choose my action\nI get to choose my belief system that makes me successful right those are the circuits of success\nThat result is actually a choice as well some people say why you can't choose your results and I actually disagree because I think if you choose the attitude you choose your belief system you choose the action that you take every single day you're choosing the result\nWas ... you know choice is a great word because you do have choices now you may not be able to control\nThe outcome but if you do choose those things that you know\nLead to success Ninety nine percent of the time it will be right access fall and that's and that's what you're doing is you're controlling what you can control and then at the end it works out how it was meant to workout versus saying I Want this outcome but I'm not going to change any of the mindset in between\nThen you're going to you know probably get the limited outcome\nSo what does Magic Johnson due to stay a student in the game 'cause obviously you're not just you know you just don't wake up and you remember everything but what are you doing to stay on top of your game\nYeah just work 'cause his life I mean what are you what are you doing to stay on top obviously you've got the eating or a arresting the moving I did it wrong Oregon rest eat move a ram I'll Remember that are am rams fan Dario that's um so what are you doing\nYou know I I think reading is for me the best added value for a couple of reasons allows my mind to work\nIn a way that it usually isn't working so when you have to read you slow down\nYou have to comprehend there's no distractions obviously I'm reading on my computer and my phone but it's just a distracted type of learning so reading a book to me is the best way to kind of push myself\nDome our financial can help put you and your next Tom Paul Ryan six one eight five nine three three six zero eight licensed in
