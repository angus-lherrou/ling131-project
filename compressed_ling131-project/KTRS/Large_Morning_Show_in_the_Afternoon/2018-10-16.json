the last ... what's the other one just got hacked A L Equifax effects Equifax yeah mhm [noise] All right hold on a second you want me to look at my\nHeart so I'll just do this real quick [noise] uh so at any rate this is an interesting thing I don't do you know what your credit scores of hand in the ballpark\nTwo and a half years ago I did when I was buying a house now I\nThat I looked at it lately last time I looked at it was in the upper ... seven hundred\nSo all made probably had a hundred something by now\nSo that's nice because you know and I know that um you know Kim and I it's interesting when when we got married she was carrying some debt for ... and all that and so [noise] um but so that always affects your when you get married by the way so I Do know what would nice credit scores\nAre hers is like right behind mine and only because she started out you know like a year later than I did when it came to getting getting car loans and things like that\nOK jumps on again right now to see if I get my credit score a let's see your credit score or it is free updated weekly boom I just at this burden\nCrime for hundreds [laughter] um card so [laughter] uh this guy he's fifty ... bought up my thing I'll just turn it over and we'll get into say oh this is fifty six year old government employee from Cleveland his name is Tom ...\nHe had the highest credit score in America\nEight forty eight now eight fifty is like the top it said he was ranked higher than a hundred percent of the U.S consumers loud all you know that's according to a letter that he got from a credit bureau now what do you get when you get a fifty or forty eight or whatever\nNothing\nMore mounting some flowers\nWell we get super low rates that no one hardly ever qualifies for okay so here's my credit score right here\nOkay yeah seven forty five I don't care if anybody knows what difference is like and that's probably because I own a couple of homes and you know I just carry a lotta\nBut that's a good thing too because I Know whenever I was first starting out I felt like credit companies said but you have to develop your credit more to even yes I Do not itself\nYou know when I was trying to trying to get you get right exactly you know I mean you have to have a credit history ... you know\nAnd they do look at that that kinda stuff and you know as you you know if you have a credit bomb something goes on a battle eventually fall off and you know so uh but it really is getting ... and I've told my kids is a thousand times my oldest daughter is just\nI don't know if she listens on line but get together\nOn tests or are we on the ... we are all ...\nNumber one night dating world though I feel like a credit Congress station and the finance our conversation that needs to come up right away I Want to know what I'm getting an seemed like that that's\nPretty interesting you say that I mean what would I think if a woman that I was asking out on a date how would you bring that up to minute\nThing first day the second day every day but if you see here let her then I Want to know like you're bringing\nYeah yeah yeah but here's what I thought it was interesting a score of eight\nFifty or eight forty I mean you know the bragging rights maybe you know when you get the eight hundred Z is anything over seven eighty is like excellent I'm In the B plus range or I'll give you all were nine or a minus thank you appreciate the [noise]\nUm but once you're above seven sixty it says you're going to get the best rates when you go on for a loan or you know uh when you're\nBuying a house or a car or any of that kinda stuff so [noise] um I don't know why people obsess over getting eight hundred but it is kind of interesting to me I'm like\nYou know let's let's just get up there to that higher echelon and then I forget about it and that you know you can do it but you know anything over the you know that threshold is seven fifty seven sixty in anything above that\nYou know it doesn't make a difference if you get the eight hundred you know I mean I don't know what you would have to do in your life to get to that level the Tom developed or did\nYou know but the highest score in America you may get a plaque whatever but the the the thing is that uh it really does matter you know uh and as long as you're making payments I think you know you just I always say if you get into some kind of trouble\nWe and we do not have any information on that that's not to say the police don't have that at this point the only things that they alluded to during the press conference today is that they're looking at phone information and social media activity um perhaps a you know if\nIf and Jamie has her cell phone with her they're able to paying that that and find out a location if she is ... posted anything to social media or if someone has posted something about her\nOn social media that's also something they're monitoring as well so yeah no stone unturned at this point but we are not aware at this point if anything conclusive when it comes to\nA you know any kind of a surveillance video I now that being said you just have to go to Iowa\nOr with the case of Mali kid that that it was\nA security camera video that ended up helping crack that case open so it's not to say that it's not out there they may still be looking for that security camera that may

that's one thing that the the county sheriff said and that's probably a pretty good reason why the FBI got involved so quickly that they're not used to dealing with this kind of information with this kind of investigation it's in the western part of the state\nIt is kind of a rural area um you know we're we're just kind of getting into that location as we don't really know how close knit community it is\nAt least according to neighbors had been a pretty quiet home all the neighbors now I Do indicate hearing gunshots fired which would obviously match up with those shell casings that police\nSay they've found but um we're we're not getting any information from neighbors that this was a troubled home or the police were constantly there were not getting any information from police that you know there were several visits or you know they're DCFS had been there for one reason or another that just that information that ah that they've got or that they were giving to us at\nThis point where it's

and um which we lived in a world where there wasn't but [noise] it's gonna be there you know uh\nBut we don't want to be the hotbed of it so it's kind of bring that up because you know I'm not certain that this was even a\nAttacked the woman at this apartment complex or condos [noise]\nUm who was leaving and I like when the news says she was living or do I go to the bathroom where's their dog bathroom Eddie ... butter your dog to go do its business and a guy I happen to be coming in\nAt approximately the same time this happens you know busy building or whatever especially [noise] you know after work or you know and and heavy traffic hours and somebody's coming out and somebody else is going in and you catch the door and you go hey how you doing you walk in a boom\nThat's how strangers to get in sometimes yeah I'm so this woman was leaving and this guy was on his way in and we don't really know what precipitated the event that we saw on video before the video was being filmed because somehow\nIf you're going to be filming somebody something had to have happened\nTo make you take your camera out and start rolling sure yeah right yeah I mean if it\nYou know for anything different to be you know bona pocket and not have a viral thing I Wish I think everybody wishes that were different that it happened differently with is a black guy young black professional guy was coming into this building where he lives\nYou know and maybe he was wrong there but once he identified you didn't have to tell her what apartment enough to tell her anything didn't have to give it a name this is not a police officer this is somebody who lives in the building she has no right to question\nYou know she may have a right to question coming in the building but she has no right to to find out where he lives what his name as he identified the uh the the people in the building\nThat run the ... you know the the building he has can you know Sandy gotten the elevator when there was a condo or apartment don't\nYou followed him you do your thing then you called nine one one you exacerbated it I see all manner of things that are wrong with this all manner now I Would reconsider if I were her company they fired or yeah or they claimed racism and racial profiling and all that and that was something that\nYou know she was married to a black guy you know so we didn't know the whole story but I stand by look uh it just I I think it did the wrong thing\nAnd they get to the wrong thing to do 'em long as you're safe you leave the building but him in the building than than if you wanted to call the police say this got pushed his way through okay but you did the whole the wrong thing all the way through I think I just I don't have the wind nobody can see that but that's my
