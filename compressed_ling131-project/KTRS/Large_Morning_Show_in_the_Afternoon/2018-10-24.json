Monday who is a great great director uh you also as a Beatles bio pic from the mid nineties called back seat\nAnd this was when Peter Best we're still in the band and it it got Stephen ... in it and Shirley and um it's a really really great sort of a grungy you look at the early Beatles back before they really became the Beatles and now he's got a great soundtrack as well but of course 'cause it's all early Beatles stuffed\nA then you've got a love and mercy which is good did you watch them the beach boys drain loss and very sad felt yes Hi Brian Wilson obviously a lot of mental issues are not that he's been very open with\nA kind of a mistreated by some of the people in his life including that one manager a ... in a in that film and what's interesting about this is at two different actors\nPlay Brian Wilson in the movie yet pulled into as the young young young when they were doing good vibrations in the rest of the band is saying well what are you just make no sense which I can totally understand their deeds kind of mad\nBut of course were just amazing work of art and then John to sack of all people play the older Brian Wilson and um and that's really interesting casting but it's a great film and really heartbreaking when a as well then you've got lots of what's love got to do with it\nWith Laurence Fishburne and Angela basket of you've heard of this one ... one okay this is this is Tina Turner ...\nAnd and so what's love got to do with it is fantastic it's got a pretty terrifying turn by Laurence Fishburne though because they really go into the diagnostics that a turnaround was guilty of at the time\nOr one of my favorites I saw this when I was very young I knew nothing about Loretta Lynn nothing about country music because before I moved to Nashville coal miners daughter is an incredible bio pic are you talking about going from nothing to everything from rags to riches\nI'm ... and ... space to act is Loretta Lynch she's fantastic her husband is played by\nA timely Jones it's a really really wonderful wonderful film I've got three more I'm going to try to keep time straight ...
