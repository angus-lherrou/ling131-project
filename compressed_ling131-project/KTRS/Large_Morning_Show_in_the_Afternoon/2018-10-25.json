Laurel\nAre gone Sherry and I are going to be two members willy and that should be mad but earlier magic can't be a venture you may be a art or we're going to take a little adventure here and a ... to ah what's happening here a naturally it's uh\nIt's pretty heinous stuff state Gomez is with us She's a former special agent with the FBI Steve welcome to the guy Phillip show in St Louis\n\nSo Steve look all these bombs going off or or I'm Sorry ... each rephrase that that was a horrible way to start all of these bombs being sent\nNone of them have exploded he's more of a I'm a ... it's the intent is to create havoc in chaos rather than to actually harm anyone\nWell we definitely accomplishing that\nIt's definitely creating chaos and fear\nAnd with the elections coming up in the next twelve days I'm hoping that it's not going to have an influence on our political system in agenda mhm hum it probably already has a we just got a public didn't take it that way\nA one way or the other I mean I Believe that this is being approached the domestic terrorism investigation because of the fact that the vices were sent to a mostly a democratic politicians or people with democratic leaning\nAnd so as a result you have to assume that there is some type of political agenda behind these devices being ...\n... is this a false flag operation\nNickel agenda behind these devices being ...\nIs this a false flag operation do you think um in other words you know the false flag\nIs when I guess my reduced the books are different than their parents like something they could get safe passage and then wreaked havoc in other words a ... is this being done\nFrom you know the the left to the left for is being done from the rights of the left I mean how how do we really know what's\nHappening in in ... and ... these people down\nWell from the standpoint of whether it's a false flag or not\nI think that the investigation had to keep every in every\nPossible theory on the table they they can't rule anything out at this point they let the evidence take them where the evidence takes them or whether it's a false flag whether it is somebody who's on the on the on the right side of the political spectrum or maybe it's just somebody who wants to\nYou know I'm you know create chaos for no other reason other than to get attention\nOn we we don't know that yet but\nThe fact that these devices were sent but didn't explode\nAnd probably had a very low chance that they were going to reach their final destination the they're intended victims I mean a lot of these people you know former President Obama Hillary Clinton and so on I mean these people have various layers of screening that is done on all of their male none of them are going out to their\nMailbox and pick it up their male so the chance that they were actually going to receive these taxes is very very low\nFor most of them but but uh so so you have that so then you start to wonder like what what was what was the intent if but if he's devices weren't going to go walk they didn't go off and uh and nobody got hurt so was it just to create fear and chaos\nFoot for what reason for which side to that that's really a good question that still has to be answered\nIn a lot of people team over the last thirty six hours just turning questioning okay what makes the package look ... can you give us any insights on the line forcing standpoint on ... or\n... and and and the packages and they and the um the photographs that have been pushed out\nTo the media to the public are are very instructive\nUh you'll you'll see in these packages there were a lot of steps that were placed on on the package a there was a lot of tape that was applied all over the package\nA these were a very unusual a state of objects that you know the way they are they viewed [laughter] you know when you pick up the package if you look at that package you know it it was a strange size of object\nUm and that you know so you have to think about you know are there any like wires protruding or something unusual um similar to this you know like like a pipe bomb you\nAlso have to consider is there is some type of odor is there a you know maybe some kind of liquid that's leaking get some of those things that those are red flags and you've got to you know leave the package alone call the cops let them do their thing\nAnd all of the return addresses on them as they were Debbie Wasserman Schultz is that correct\nYes it was at least an address that was for it to her office which which I don't believe was the case\nSince you know Steve do postal workers or anybody at the post office have any kind of training to know hey this is kind of build off of Laura's question but I mean the thing was allowing upon\nBomb in his being delivered to an important figure like this\n[noise] yes I Do they definitely receive training I mean instruction um you know a lot of it yeah you know if they think that it's
