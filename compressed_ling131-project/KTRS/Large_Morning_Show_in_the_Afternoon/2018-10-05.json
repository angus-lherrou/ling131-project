but uh but the way judge Kavanaugh made such a partisan statement about a conspiracy theory of a cleanser Democratic Party what goes around comes around should disqualify him I think he's referring to

S. [noise]\nIt's time to plug yet [noise]\nPresented by somebody will\nGo one place to talk about all things related to the average changing landscape of today's tomorrow's technology technology thing is certainly moving fast to join the conversation\nLine drama on my five year old ... year old now guy Philips Katie R. S.\nHere but that's okay because cats curled\nIs lead engineer at something there when we were so happy to have you back to [noise] talk pack or ... ... talk to a remote [laughter] we're focusing today on ransomware attack [noise] can you\nBy just explaining\nDoes that mean for the regular person\nFor the regular person basically this is a hacker whose putting a piece of code on your computer but being crypts your files so that you cannot use them and then they're holding them up for ransom asking you to pay a a ransom usually in crypto currency to give you a key to the news to decode your files basically it\nIs something to happen in normal everyday people or is this something that usually just happened in the business sector\nHum it's more ... more than a business that they're not so much with individuals but it can't happen with individual to um I Would say that the higher profile somebody has um socially or something like that the more targeted they are basically\nAnd just so so if this happens like let's just say it happened to me would it be smart for me to go ahead and pay the people for that because I mean what what's the saying there ever actually going to give me the key and even if they give me the key what to say they're not going to re rocket I don't know next week\nThere's there there is a good argument there because you\nWalk it I don't know next week\nRight there's ... there's a good argument there because you self identify as the targets once you actually pay the ransom my recommendation is to not pay the ransom and to engage in IT professional to a council you all through the process it may end up that if your files or that important to you and there's no other method to resolve it\nYou know you don't have a backup to restore from or something like that that you want to pay the ransom boat there's lots of other avenues we can investigate to solving first\nWhat is Polly more sec\nYeah don't sound that that's the real bad news right now um there's been a handful of of a ransom where's that have evolved over time and so basically\nWhen a when a ransomware that's that's particularly nasty comes out most of the anti virus and time our companies create software that will detect that if it ever gets on your system and as soon as it sees the file to quarantine and throw it somewhere so it can't do damage\nWhat the new ones are doing is that they're actually the code is evolving so the result modifying and then there's hackers making new variants of them\nThat the evade detection from the programs in these insect very quickly we recently mitigated one that took down to servers and the course of sixty minutes over six hundred thousand filed the ... so\nIt still went to use tapped into how they get those files back\nYes uh well it depends ... you know you can get him back very quickly if you have a good backup and DR plan and we we we recommend one to our customers um they can engage us for our smart backup um solution\nAnd we were able to restore one server within sixty minutes and then the other ... store in a little bit longer period of time but yeah it's ... as long as you have a good backup plan in place you're you're you should be okay so what\nIs probably like the number one way because I mean I think most of the time whenever we're kind of you know doing the whole tucked awkward talking more so to individuals with just home computers so what's the number one thing that somebody at home should look out for the to not have their computer ransom to\nThe number one thing you can do is be a critical consumer when it comes to email the vector for attack for rent somewhere is almost always email though if you get an email and you don't know what it is don't click on any links and then\nDon't open

me this is something you meant to send to me\n[noise] so is this something that happens with the computer I'm holding in my hand smartphone too\nIs that an apple phone that is okay you you're actually in pretty good shape and I would not want to be an Android user because androids do have do suffer from those uh\nYeah uh I don't like apple products all that much I I get that argument but at the end of the day the Android operating system is a vector large of actor from our in viruses ...\nSo you're telling me that it's actually just as simple as clicking on an email link to download this

awareness nights up slowly I had no idea until you walking around the up so during October are there any tips you're gonna have to align we're\nWe are passing along tips on our blog and\nUm and we're also doing blog posts and every show that we do this month also is going to court correlate to the topic of the week and everything like this week you know being ransomware so and sensitive national cyber security months that if you just Google national cybersecurity months um you'll you'll see all sorts of links and sites out there that you can go to\nThat uh should educate you as an end user\nAnd I were to see him as technology continues to develop you're going to be busy over the next ... into the world\n... it's been a it's been an interesting past month for us because we've seen a lot of viruses and a lot of ransomware over the past month and I don't know what the ramp up as do too but\nYeah what any correlation no\nNothing I can see except maybe in preparation for national cyber security months he thought hey we'll do this right before that wants to\nStart really screw with that and now\nThere's just something that kind of popped into my mind and maybe I don't know if you're listening to the show on the way here today but I'm ... yesterday I went to the blues game this has been all over the news about the whole global ticket saying you know they claim that I think the main reason why they want to do the mobile ticket is to avoid having any issues with people bringing you know fraudulent tickets up to the the\nBut my thought is anything that's on a computer and apparently on my Android devices especially\nMy thought is what's really to stop somebody from somehow hacking in and making a big ticket or when that he was easier to fake than a paper ticket or not the\nEasier as relatives for some hackers that might be an easy exercise I think it's a little bit more secure the paper goes paper obviously you can make very very good copies of paper no matter what what you do to try to to uh you know obfuscate what's on it um but um but yeah I mean they're going to constantly have to be in a cycle stay one step ahead of the hackers all the time\nOr does that mean that leaves me and my second question can you give me tickets at\nHis game [laughter] I think it would need to talk to the marketing pull\nOut and we would like\nTo hear from listeners and find out how they hear about tech talk whenever you call something everyone please let them know how you heard about them that through radio hopefully social media website word of mouth\nAbsolutely and

Yankees I Want Yankees because I'm ... [noise]\nI think that um\nThey're so evenly matched offensively mhm I think it'll come down to pitching and I think um\nI think to the Yankees it's the red Sox are going to have to prove to people that they can trust their starting pitching in a playoff\nSeries but with with judge back stay in going well in the addition of a red hot little boy um the Yankees may be able to match the high

south Carolina secondary and by that I mean you will see all sorts of mine have to do with it if they give drew enough time I think he can be\nA South Carolina's defensive backs who have been very good they voted not given up more than one passing touched on a game\nAnd excuse me and I believe that but if given the time I think lock and pick them apart so I think that'll be the difference right now I'm for the last line I checked early today was South Carolina at one point favorite I think ms who wins\nThirty five twenty four oh okay that's good because I think the I think what they need to

would you rather be the best students in the worst college or the worst students in the best college\nWorst in the past\nYeah really worst in the snow you would want to be the best in the worst college that way you can say I better than you lose there as well I Know but whenever you go on a job interview most of the time people are like oh yeah that university they're more like ... where did you come in and your class of what was your grade\nPoint I disagree with that every job interview I've ever had the university is why we discuss we never discussed where did you finish in college now your grades now never had to share my GPA\nReally okay fair enough I Would probably take the well you know what I still think the best student a worst holiday thing\nWhy you're not going to be any better by you and you have no one to push you\nKnow but if you're really bad and the ... well I don't know unless you're in a college with a lot of smart people but still being the worst students means that you're probably not picking up on anything so you're just probably wasting your time I don't know I don't want to be okay All right hey this is a tough one would you rather stop using the Internet or live five years last\nStop using the Internet and either live longer I don't I Know this was a time\nWhen I couldn't do any of my nine jobs if I didn't use the Internet\n... see I like to

but yeah the\nGuy huh All right fair enough I'll be the ... position because I'm Bad at math and I think I could probably get a lot of cool jobs doing that guy so this one's kinda morbid but it's

no I don't want to\nBe ... but think about this Sherry really means is if you're a hundred and sixty that means that the rest of your family has since passed on because that would be hard but you'd still rather do that [laughter]\nYes because you know I don't want to miss any new episodes that could come for after with with either ... or game of Thrones these pre called I don't want to make money that Matt addicted [laughter]\nGee it's kinda hard I think I Would probably take winning the lottery because I'd rather spend the time I have like half of the time really happy with a lot of
