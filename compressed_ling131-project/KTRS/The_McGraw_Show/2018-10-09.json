you just can't get it clean a there's that spot in the corner that you've tried that won't nothing will work there how 'bout that ripple that that that stain or the the the cut of the ... in the carpet\nOn trying to keep the streets clean how was that even possible\nWhy when you do not that many million and help the homeless in the addicted as opposed to just spending\nIt on on lately now allergic cleaning up after they try and help these people so you don't have to clean up after him or\nChess really totally drowned the area with toilet paper [laughter] it's\nEr nurse ... comes just as a whole other story we're talking about here is just a second but waiting patiently for Sherry pressed into joined us uh ABC News his own show you press and there was a story out there that Facebook um after being hacked and being hacked again ... I'd gotten a number of these messages\nOh yeah right the identical message um I got another friend request from you blah blah blah hope push down the methods thing right\nThat's a that's a hack and they're trying to break into your Facebook page or whatever it is another hack will now a Facebook has announced that they're going to somehow put a camera they want to put a camera in your home\nAnd then say oh hey guess what it's really not going to work all that much it's really ... when you think it's on it's it's not on we're going to put it on but it's not going to work\nAnd the camera can follow you\nAlso you know the whole thing has got massive issues to calling him a smart camera and smart sound that this is they're they're trying to get into the elects the game which the more the more we get into this Alexa game the more I think people who are um conspiracy theorists have it right\n[laughter] or at least when it comes to a lecture\nAnd makes us all feel like we're conspiracy theorists I thing\nWell mine's just every once in a while just sort of as a I didn't hear you and you're like I wasn't talking\nTo you what are you doing or I didn't say anything I didn't\nSay anything that a little too weird it's constantly listening but it's not listening to you how was that possible so I don't handle like that but you have to kind of like oh that that open command don't you get to say Alexa you never had that Jennifer ... what time is it like you got to yell at it it's like [laughter] like I\nSaid that's why that's at our lives it was so funny Alexis Susan what's your name [laughter] I may have thought what's your name on the one of those boys doing over there\nThey're they're singing of this right now than I Am so sorry for us an ABC News a correspondent Sherry what is going on with Facebook what are they trying to convince us to do next\n... does it cracks me up and as I'm listening to you as you do this and here's what Facebook says they said the effect is meant to make it\nLike you have your own private camera crew following you at all times which I don't want\nOwn private camera crew following you at all times which I don't want you want that question [laughter] the one that I mean and they say it's because\nYou know it's needed because you know video conferencing can be bad and and it can be ... and you know shaky and things like that and and if you want a camera crew following the kids around so that when they're faced timing with grandma you can um it's not a\nYou know the kids jump all over the couch and whatever and they'll follow their every move and I'm reading this and I'm thinking\nI don't know if a lot of parents are going to be all over that\nAnd so what they want us to buy a unit with a camera on it it's a unit you can\nBuy one of two different kinds it's it's a two hundred dollar unit which just with like sit on your table top and then you can if I have three hundred and fifty dollars a unit that shifts from um you know portrait mowed down to landscape mode in case you want people to see the whole room or something like that both of them will track you\nYou have to give it directions and you would say portal call you know of a girl and Kelly and they would and then they would call you guys and you would pop up on my screen I Would pop up on your screen and you would have the video conference call going and they say also that it does hit record it doesn't track your phone calls it doesn't keep\nTrack of that but you guys what we've been talking about the Facebook for a year for for a really long time about questions about security\nBecause Facebook tracks everything else the only thing they won't track of this next thing\nThat's what they say they say that it is not meant to do that um you know but they were going to unveil it back in March but because of\nCambridge Analytica and the third party ... thing and the other question serious questions about security they didn't they held it until now and are they only get on the same day [laughter] that Google has dropped Google Plus because they've known that that that that you know there was a way to get in there um and they didn't say anything\nTo anybody who realize people have long memories\nNo you know they realize that people don't have long memories ... what is Google Plus jury explain that in in sorry to see it go what what can Google it was a Google Plus\nWas that was a thing that was launched in ... eleven that was to compete with Facebook\nAnd the idea was that you would go on Google Plus and you would can can you know can do pictures and things with your friends like that like today when we have the story I said even on Google Plus anymore\nAnd our news manager said well I was in a couple of radio stations have talked to today said\nThat they were still on Google Plus too but they had a flaw in the system\nThat allowed third parties to go in and get your information and get information from your friends on Google Plus two and according to a Wall Street journal report Google knew about this law\nBack in March but deliberately didn't tell people because they didn't want to be compared to Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal [noise]\nSo that's what has people angry today about this at Google knew about this disclosed it\nAnd didn't say anything the c._e._o. of Google says he will appear on Capitol Hill to talk about all this coming up in the next couple of weeks but every time we we have one of these stories about what is you know what's being tracked about you online how much they're following you and everything like that people say I'm angry I'm angry and then they just do right back on\nThe wall and the other thing too is we don't track oh wait a minute we're we're tracking it we didn't know that oh my goodness why don't we are tracking you by the way your ABC News room and that uh he should probably turn off his my space page to if he's on Google Plus\nIt at like ... or ... or their\nShare of experts are going to crush a guy he's seven twenty six year big five fifty gay tears I Wonder if he still has his products or you can do up and running [laughter]

a\nCalled a tenderloin or on hide street it's about a hundred yard long portion of the streets by the way we should also mention\nAlso in this neighborhood is a Twitter is their world headquarters there and a couple of a tech giants are are are are All right there it is so bad\nI'm that the city had to replace three hundred lampposts now why are they have to um replaced three hundred lampposts because the metal was corroded by human urine over the last number of years\nReally yes it came so bad that one of the polls fell down and collapsed and two thousand Fifteen crushing a car\nThe more common danger or ... of heroin needles and the public works department and a nonprofit organization picked up a hundred thousand needles from the streets of the last year but it gets worse\nAnd the public health department which has its own needle recovery program retrieved a hundred and sixty four thousand needles in August\nJustin a month in in August I'm listening to this where do we go here um\nYou know they should really do you know Paris they have this new thing um the the public ...\nYes have you seen those\nWhere you say no they ...\nLike a month ago they unveiled them where\nMen can just go to the public ... they're right there out in the open next San Francisco need something like\nThat ever Cisco has four port a potties for four thousand homeless people\nFor for\nFor yes I'd ever found rate is so bad that you can't walk to work without smelling like a latrine they are seeing a human feces pile up all over the place you have to walk over the human feces walking over the homeless people to get to your job\nYeah it is so bad believer that somebody ... they they they started a unit I'm In the city of San Francisco and it's called the proactive human waste unit\nAnd they are going out and cleaning off the human feces from the street in San Francisco it's so bad somebody just created an app\nCalled well there is going through this cold snap crap and do you take a picture and send it to city hall so they know where the problems are\nBoy that sound Seventy million Seventy\nMillion annually on street claiming you know the shame is San Francisco's beautiful city not ... I Love San Francisco and I realized that make sure you know the lamppost but um\nThat's just [noise] they need to do some type of a public health education thing and and find some place and\nFor the homeless if I'm if I'm mayor light a cruise and I'm Steve stinger why not call up these companies and say\nDo you enjoy stepping over human feces we have all we have our problems but we don't have those problems why don't you come pay less rent to have a better cost of living have have happier employees than than than going through this rat race and ...\nThe weather is finally turning ambitious post beautiful patio is ready for you when the sun is shining stop by and relax with a drink and good food on their patio overlooking a waterfall ships posted located off Chesterfield parkway when an extraterrestrial mall on line to ships post dot com hiring\nTrying zip recruiter unlike most job boards zip recruiter finds candidates for you and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates bashed zip recruiter the smartest way to hire trying for free at ... dot com slash joins zoo football color analyst Howard Richard\n... my father died without a will I ended up finding and insurance policy and an annuity when he knew I found that leaving for his effects\nScott Garcia premier estate an income planning most\nPeople are to the understanding that if they have a will they'll avoid probate that's all they have in most cases they will not have ... so we see the vast majority of people find that out too late and real estate planning is not complicated can be with us it's not complicated we have a Ninety Ninety proprietary process we can do most of the state plans Ninety percent of the Ninety minutes\nAttend the next educational workshop Tuesday October twenty third in Thursday October ... pm the pasta house in Arnold, Missouri called three one four five eight zero zero five to four seeding is limited reservations are required three one four five eight zero zero five\nTo four premier estate in income planning BEP network T.

I don't get it it makes no sense to me whatsoever because\nTechnically he was meeting with his boss technically it was let's throw as much garbage out as humanly possible to make Loretta Lynch look as bad as possible and make Hillary Clinton look as bad as possible\nAnd yet our guys doing the same exact thing maybe even worse and uh we don't mind that but he does it say that it's it's it's all political but\nLook at it this way if your boss called un to meet you got to meet with him\nNot if I'm investigating them and it's not the same as my boss I Am not investigating my boss or I'm not running the investigation that is investigating my ball I understand that and a you know what I Would love\nIf I was under some type of indictments I Would love to call in Bob cola and said Bob stop investigating me when I'm your boss it doesn't work that way that's not the way it works I understand that\nI Know there I can hear you now Tony either okay\nHere I'm Sorry to hear about your uh Rockies now is a tough tough wait oh\nGosh it was a depressing Sunday for me I'm never watching sports and\nTill next Sunday yeah All right let's get to it um talk about this proposition too which is not getting a lot of attention when it deals with the parks a you've been writing about this the last couple of days what's going on\nYeah well you know one of the things that struck me as we've got a big ballot in November there's lots of propositions their state wide or even mentioned propositions and there's a bunch of stuff on the county valid and and this one is really interesting and I thought that that might escape people's attention but\nI was driving by creek or a memorial park a few weeks ago and I haven't been there uh in in almost a year since I've been writing about the proposed arena that ended up going somewhere else in the ... over that was\n... and it struck me I I just went up to the park and walk around a little bit in that area of land that they cleared um you know hundred thousands of trees and and and do wild land area and just you know beautiful natural part of the park\nA still looks kind of like a moonscape if I mean basically they they said it at a grass and weeds are growing and some wildflowers that these big retention ponds that were built for a parking lot\nAnd a big growth are are just sitting there like big holes in the ground and and it's just what happens\nWhen you let government uh uh you know take over a park or without without any sort of plan without any sort of you know public process at all of that and\nAnd they sell proposition tune that the county council has put on the ballot for November is is a reaction to this but it's not just this park it turns out you know St Louis has upper wide here parks in its history where\nAfter a period of time at some point somebody came to the county executive or the county council and said hey we need a police station here when nine one one center here when he died in a\nUh and and you know the easy thing for him like they would say well we got land over there with up to buy anything left just build up there and and we forget the history of why that are there\nAnd and what people use it for and donate it the land and all of those sorts of things so proposition does\nIt it says you can't do that anymore if if if the county wants to use existing Parkland for something\nCommercial a government purpose whatever uh they've got to go to the people and uh\nI I I personally think that makes a lotta sense what the history of St Louis and what's happened to override if it's ... it's interesting I've got a lot of emails from the column\nI'm from people reminding me of other examples there silver springs which are part which is going to be dedicated to Jefferson Barracks a lot people think that's a great idea but still being done without a public vote\nThere's there's over ... west which where a a nine one one center was built again an important thing but does it have to be in the park there's there's there's lots of examples in this county history where our government officials have said\nYou know we preserve that ran for ... for the next generation but we're going to just skip over that\nAs a member of the great rivers\nIn fact we're going to skip over that\nAs a member of the great rivers greenway bored I'm not going to be very careful in in what I say I'm not going to take a position one way or the other on prop too but from what I understand Tony ... to ... will allow Jefferson Barracks to take that land\nFor the uh for the cemetery and then everything else would have to go to a vote after that\nYes that decisions are already been made it was pre emptive and and um\nSo you know that one has gone and I know there are some people upset about that I haven't done any reporting on that I Do believe there's been a lot of public process on that and that sort of\nOne of the main things about the spirit behind this law is to make sure that this stuff doesn't happen without without people really having to say now I also differentiates between really great parks like you know regional parks like create for\nMemorial park or small little parks like one I wrote about on the south side that doesn't even have a name\n'em in which the the county a couple of years ago and twenty Fifteen police crash sake and at the ballpark
