week to go to talk to you about your pets\nUm please give us a call here at the questions at three one for nine six nine Katie arrest we did get a text for a question about\nCatnip yeah absolutely I'd say I'm definitely if you have a cat that gets\nI'm excited and happy and a active on cutting up put it on those toys spread it around get him that might get him going some cats just want to roll around in it and take a nap so it might not help those cats\nKind of get 'em all adults like a stone yeah an ally but it never\nHurts the cat ever so you can give it a try\nSee what happens they make ... make toys are infused with now so I mean you couldn't they buy you can buy bags of catnip to having all over you know for those scratching posts and scratching hardboard things but also our towel flat out they do make toys and yeah I can literally you know we've had catnip infused bubbles\nAt our house before is that none of my cats unfortunately have gone for but like if your cat did go for that would be great exercise that I guess the plan is for them to like jump up and try to ... above bubbles I've never seen that I'll leave it to my husband he's bought every cat toy they're interesting\nIf Logan weren't so darn old and can't really jump I Would totally be granted right that'd be pretty cool oh my gosh that would be awesome for a cat in up in general yeah the cat and it was fantastic it using for weight loss obviously you want to make sure that doesn't cause them sleepiness and take I make him take a longer nap in the Eighteen hour nap that they take all day anyway\nSo [laughter] um catnip it's very cool and and you can get those at any any oh anywhere that's absolutely I'm so let's do a little diving into the consequences of overweight ... nobody knew yeah yeah so there's always consequences to your actions and who you're a\nLifestyle lifestyle choices unfortunately [laughter]\nSo ah let's see ... well I guess most of this really applies to both cats and dogs sure more heart disease a tension yup absolutely hypertension high blood pressure uh insulin resistance so\nType two diabetes basically a witch death as I mentioned I dealt with in my own chunky ...\nExtra fat leads to insulin resistance so it makes them not being able to respond to insulin as efficiently and you know we've got fifty percent of our all these cats have a decrease in insulin sensitivity and that it really really increases the risk for diabetes\nAbsolutely and you guys I had the sweetest cat and the universe but still I Do not enjoy given him shots twice a day oh no not not fun for me\nIt's a little bit uh limiting and the freedom to go out and enjoy your evening from the selfish human point of view and so we had to get shots twice a day well unfortunately\nDiabetes decreases our life and it turned out to you know they give you an average of of from diagnosis of diabetes to lung you know tell they pass away usually for years now and and unfortunately unless obviously the you know it's some cats are easier to regulate than others but they really you want your animals to live as long as they possibly can\nYeah and it's if you think about it you know if your cat is as big an early age and gets diagnosed with diabetes it six you know you've real shave some years office\nSince we're talking about cats yeah how about ... fatty liver disease I mean just the most simple is like hold of not eating for a couple of days can push them into fatty liver disease\nAnd this is where their body is taking energy from the liver and replacing\nThat with fat and so that can pretty quickly lead into a situation where the cat is in liver failure has to have be hospitalized have things like feeding tubes place it's a pretty significant\nDie from yeah I got I think so yeah so it's certainly you know if you if you have a overweight cat uh hopefully you are working on their weight loss but if they ever have a period of time even you know twenty four forty eight hours of not eating\nThat's a phone call to your veterinarian because we don't want to get secondary ramifications of the not eating um and unfortunately some cats can kind of just go on\nStrike to eat without any underlying reasons sometimes just a little bit of stress can trigger that and so it's really important is that does happen to to contact your veterinarian there are some appetite stimulant and maybe even some testing to make sure that there isn't anything else going on\nBut [laughter] but um anyway I I don't know a little out of power I don't know for that one that are in um both cats\nThe dog parks and recreation six one eight to Seventy seven twenty two Seventy five or take a tour on their website anytime\nThat lucky dog

S. or eight eight five fifty K. C. R. S. or you can text us at eight for one to six\nUm we did have someone who um\nMessage over the last segment and asked approximately how many calories her a female spade eighty pound Labrador Retriever would need and I I Know this is a frustrating question but the answer is we don't we don't know\nYou would really have to put our hands on her and determine what her body condition score is and what her current weight and then what her ideal weight would be in order to be able to calculate that so\nIt would probably be a very good idea ten maybe have a consultation with your veterinarian about that and they can help figure that out for you ...\nIt will tell you to just off the cuff I have an eighty pounds neutered male dog and he gets about two cups of food a day but that that is really I Can't really kept his ... he's really high energy not a couch potato\nAnd he is on you know I don't know what kind of food right food ... the kind of food also makes a huge difference because we also need to know what the calories per cop are for the food so in short\nContact your veterinarian and they can help you determine what the ideal weight would be and then the calorie requirements for her as well as like\nYeah yeah that would be my number one recommendation I'm ... and speaking about foods there are there really are huge\nVariety a of number of calories in a cup of dog or cat food so I'm just now if anybody tells you oh all dogs that way thirty pounds need this number of ... per day don't believe them because it all depends on um\nWhat kind of dog how how accurate that dog is is he neutered and especially what kind of food or see on that certainly and and be sure if you have an adult dog or cat\nTake a minute look at your bag of dog food and make sure that that food is for adult\nAnimals if it says for all life stages that means that it has enough calories\nTo maintain gross and either puppies are kittens and your adult animal is not growing and does not need those calories should not be growing up we don't want any horizontal gross and\nNot even necessarily just gross leads to use also are higher and protein they're higher in some requirements for that growth which can also have a negative impact on an older dogs organs kidneys livers et cetera so he's all life stages foods are\nJust they they they need well may sound great because you've got a puppy at home and you've got a twelve year old dog at home we we can feed the same food\nBut it really is not how you're supposed to feed your animals each one needs to have their own the puppies kittens need to have their own poppy kitten food I\nOn the on puppies kittens need to have their own puppy kitten food adult dogs need to have their own adult food\nAnd we know we know that they all want to eat each other's food I Know and it is hard and I don't have a magic bullet for how to solve this problem it takes creativity and you sometimes just have to stand there and be present while they're eating and then pull up their food\nWell I you know I I have two dogs and their their Labrador Retrievers and as if everybody's had known Labrador Retrievers they live for food that's all they think about twenty four seven is food\nAnd both of my dogs eat and completely separate area as one dog eats in one room and the other dog eats and the other room behind closed doors when they're done with our food the bulls get picked up and it's not left down\nAnd it's you know people people who feed their animals free feet free fat meaning they leave the food down all the time and just fill the ball as it's empty\nSometimes that can play in your favor if you've got a dog but just kind of takes the cable once or twice but there is no way in the world that certain breeds of dog and certain dogs can be fat free sad because they will eat until\nNow all of it completely down and you know three back to the food layers yeah so it's really important to be able to and and honestly when you are free feeding food you're leaving the food down all the time it's really number one difficult to measure how much food they're eating number two it's hard to regulate the other dogs or cats in the house that are trying to get to the food as well\nAnd it's it's also sometimes speaking of not even obesity but if you have any animal that's free fad sometime you don't catch their lack of appetite ... until they haven't eaten for three or four meals\nWhereas if you've got an animal who is fed at a certain time you know immediately oh they didn't eat there want to eat their breakfast this morning we keep rise pray\nAnd hope they didn't want to eat their dinner time to call the veterinarian mhm so so all of these you know it's it's important to be able to to know how much you're feeding measure their food and and it helps control their their intake\nYeah and and guys they're annoying like they are annoying my cat's drives me crazy from about if I'm home three thirty PM till five pm get fed at five PM like I I totally get it these animals\nAre they love food I Love food I sympathize with them I Wish I had somebody saying to me no\nNo no you don't get to eat anything right now\nYou have to wait till dinner and I had to listen out I I said I suppose that's why the celebrities are often and beautiful because they do have that person so [laughter] it's just thinking about it that way your dog or cat is going to be thin and beautiful just like the celebrities because here their their personal nutritionist keeping them on track", "show_name": "The McGraw Show", "year": "2018",
