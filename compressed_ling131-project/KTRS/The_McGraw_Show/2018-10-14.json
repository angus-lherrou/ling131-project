that one of the reasons why you tune in and I certainly hope again that you turn in every ... tune in every week to we're having a senior moment on the big five fifty today is going to be a little bit different when I talk a couple of different things a couple of different subjects\nWere actually going to be starting out with somebody who will help you with everything related to this incoming\nPart I guess you'd call it fall weather or winter weather um how about you but I Am not a fan of cold anymore\nI used to be that guy and and during the winter as in college a couple of years went out to the Rockies and enjoyed it with some friends we'd go skiing and everything everything\nI just don't like cold anymore if we didn't have a cold I Would be extremely happy I Know you say go ahead and moved to a better climate but you know what St Louis is where I Am St Louis is where I have my business and enjoy everything because\nI own this company called comfort care home care where we don't take care of homes and will do some light housekeeping and things like that but what we do is we take care of people in those homes no matter what the home setting is whether it's an independent living all the way to their and their own personal residents\nBecause now we're going to start putting lights out on her outside of our homes and at that point you may want to look to see that you have enough capacity in your real electrical panel to make sure it's safe\nAnd that's something that you at ... home inspections can do that is exactly right okay and so if people want to get in touch with you what's the best way for them to do that\nProbably the best way Sean would be by phone or my numbers three one for three zero eight six for eight nine we also text okay and we also have an email jar dean inspections at G. male dot com\nOkay that's great so you're checking their furnaces ear checking the electrical systems what else can go wrong in the winter I mean let's say we get a lot of snow\nOkay a lot of snow that's a good question because there is something that almost nobody talks about or even think about you know where the exhaust for your dryer is on the outside I Do\nYou want to make sure that that's not too low where it can be covered up by snow didn't think about that ah sometimes and it has happened in the past we found that\nThe driver was way too low and has covered with snow and all that stuff came back in ... that would be lent and all that other stuff all that other stuff and it's flammable and Lynch is extremely combustible yes it is so that would be something that you may want to have somebody take a look at the other thing\nIs the plumbing thing and that would be make sure you have heat in your basement somewhere around your plumbing so it doesn't may be correct the piped\nSo you're talking about the actual water supply not the drain so stuff that is correct okay that's\nTrue and and making sure that all the out side\nSauce it's our winter arrives what does that entail that means that you wanted to make sure if they have shut off on the interior of the home that that is shut off on the interior so there was no water that goes out to the outside to freeze expand the pipes\nAnd then they have a tendency to crack or\nBreak so what you're saying is hopefully there's shut off on the inside of the house that you can turn off and it should be there ... or so turn that off and and then open it up outside so anything can drain out ...\nMake sure you get all the water out take the hoses the way to take them off take them off that the big thing that those houses off and that is a huge thing no some of the newer a sponsored by the way have a ... valve\nI'm fine suits by the way have a ... valve to me I don't freeze in mess up your ...\nLike the frost prove kind of thing where when you turn it off all the water\nDrains out to exactly so there's space but there there's air space between the actual outside Fawcett and the inside turn off that is correct okay ah been there and done that I totally understand why so yeah if it's it's a great idea\nYou know white it's not only a great idea it is the only idea to turn off your hoses turn off the faucets going outside and disconnect ... absolutely okay so we talked about a little bit about your dryer events don't have to close to the ground make sure it's clear we talked about\nMaking sure that the uh inside water supplies are either insulated or have access to heat to keep them from freezing right um what about a sewer drain should you be looking at potentially having them cleaned if you haven't er or if you if you haven't\nHad somebody do throughout her own okay uh that to make sure that the lines are clear that there is nothing wrong with the with the old type\nUm that they don't have cracks in them and they have to cast iron right are you also want to make sure that the drainage is doing very well through a sewer lateral would do wonders for somebody okay you know when we go in and do an inspection we check all that\nWe just don't do the camera okay on down the main stack mhm that's where the sewer lateral person comes in her [noise] uh and that would be important\nRight and and so you know especially for people who I work with who comfort care works with you know they may be thinking about moving mhm so is that something where your company can come in and help them understand what's going to happen and what their house if they decide to sell\nAbsolutely would we do we do what's called the\nPre lifting inspection\nOr what we do in that particular inspection is we tell people what his there that somebody else may find so they can have the repairs done prior to we can also explain to the ... person selling the house in layman terms that\nEasy to understand better terms\nReally wouldn't needs to be done before the say\nSee folks Hank understands me I Need easy to understand because there's so much going on sometimes\nYou get these technicians and they say well the discombobulated is not attached to the thermal regulator and I'm like huh\n[laughter] so I look I get and and you're not there to tell them oh my gosh are never going to be able to sell the house God no he hasn't been there to help educate them about what may be seen by a potential buyer or their agent that's\nAll it is just to give them the information maybe educate them a little bit mhm that way they have everything in their hand at the time that they want to make the sale\nAnd on top of that I mean thinking about it from a seller's perspective\nYou may have buyers agent come in and say you know what you need to replace this whole electrical panel because it's going to go up in flames tomorrow God Forbid\nAnd you have already done the inspections say yeah there are still capacity left it is a newer model it's not one of these old ones that are prone to that so they have that information available in writing in writing with your particular stamp on it which happens to be accredited by\nCertification is by ... or the American society of home inspectors which\nYou have always said is sort of like a\nPre eminent the gold standard for home inspectors right it is the gold standard see folks I've known Hank now for about what eight nine almost ten years or every ten yeah and Hank was very very good mentor of mine when I first got started in this business not because he knew home care per se\nBut she knew what I as an no uh uh a novice business owner didn't knowing how to make things better not just for\nMy clients but from my employees and for me and perspective so I you know I give Hank all the credit in the world for helping me do what I'm able to do and to keep it\nYou know keep it so that my mind doesn't go crazy on me so thank you very much\nI appreciate and just so everybody knows out there I Am blushing\nNah he's really not um I'll let you know if he does look like in ... at the end but anyway uh so again how do people get in touch with the one thing that I didn't I didn't really ask you about yet so real quickly what is it that people need to worry about their roof and the winner\n... it's called ... where the ice goes up are actually the water goes up underneath the shingles so it melts a little bit in freezes and now you have damage going into the uh ... and that's the wood underneath the Shiites mhm and that can be an extremely bad thing\nThat can be extremely expensive if you have to replace it right you have ... or so watch out for that and now when you go and do an inspection you can tell whether or not the gutters are okay right correct okay and that'll help to prevent some of that stuff right that's part of it yes and if there's other things they need to do our their suggestions you'll make\nOh absolutely we make all kinds of recommendations or suggestions okay\nGreat and so whether it's you know let's say from the basement of the roof whether it's helping people

A. argues VA benefits for their pharmacy and also those that are chant VA he came in and he said here's a program that would be able to give back on the part B and I\nPerked up because I'd never heard of a program that gave anyone any money back on part B and he said most people if they make less than let's just say two hundred thousand dollars for the last two years\nAnd\nThen uh they probably fall into that category where they're spending a hundred and thirty four dollars a month for their part B and it comes through their Social Security typically and John said well if\nYou knew that trend and you would be able to say that there would be reduced this year by forty dollars every single month okay well my goodness that's four hundred and eighty dollars so my ears perked up ... and John said at the end of the presentation after he went through all of the robots benefits\nThat this plan wraps around those those military programs\nHe said does anyone know anyone that that needs to know this information well immediately I thought of ... from that assessed I immediately thought of\nAnother friend who linked to me to wane costs men with the Kaufman signed and then of course I thought of you shine it you need to know all these people to and has helped veterans along the way so we met in March\nAnd when we met in March I said okay every one we're going to hear this wonderful program from John and they were going to ask lots and lots of questions about it and then how do we get the word out to St Louis to let them know this is a legitimate program this is a program that can help their families it\nCan make a difference in their lives and it's not going to cost them anything extra but it's going to give them a multitude of different avenues\nTo have better benefits whether it's dental and vision or anything else and I know John can go into all the details but that's how we all came together and when\nWe did it was almost like a collision of the heart where all of us have the same heart to serve others especially to serve veterans and give back to those who the given so much to us so that's how we've all bonded and I'm thrilled that we're here today remember\nEverybody were here on we're having a senior moment on Katie are is the big five fifty and I'm so glad you're joining us today we got one important information but let me also remind you that anytime you're concerned about your loved one about yourself or we're happy to come out and do a free no risk I said free no cost\nSafety risk assessment around your house will look for things that could be done better will look for things that are really dangerous um I was at a home yesterday and I was speaking with the owner who's taking care of his wife and it's just kind of like ... ...

we're having a senior moment continues to be are asked\nTo come back again everybody thinks again for joining us the Sunday Morning on we are having a senior moment to show whose mission is all about bringing information resources help for those people who were planning for the future help for those people who are receiving care right now\nAnd especially help for those people who are delivering care to their loved ones we know so many times where that\nPerson whose family and then becomes caregiver and then becomes family caregiver and eventually they lose their identity you know they become more caregiver than family and there's so much guilt involved with that we want to make sure that you have the information available\nWhere you can make the best decision possible deliver the best most effective solution to help people live in their homes where ever they call home\nAnd live their best life possible so before we went to the break we were talking with for a very very intelligent people and me\nRadio news has received the award for overall excellent and assert exclusively on the big five fifty [noise]\nMichelle friends and growing tensions between the U.S Saudi Arabia the government's\nSaying today at rejects quote threats after President Trump commented that the U.S will take severe action if there's proof Saudi Arabia is responsible for the alleged murder of Washington Post journalist ... bc and panel is in Istanbul, Turkey with more on the investigation\nKnow that it's already too you have zones of the country but in the Senate coming here to assemble they went through the capital Ankara whether periods of hot diplomatic me thinks the Turkish farmers shooting a fairly stride and statements saying this joined director was underway but he wasn't getting the level of costs\nTo just straight long term care program so we're not going to talk about insurance per se we're talking about what happens when we need healthcare\nA and we're in retirement now that's October twenty third now here's three day\nThat uh I'm ... I'm going to give it to the gate that I Want you to write wanted it to borrow Arlene the river the fix that Tuesday voting day now why would it have an investment meeting voting they well\nYou know we're going to do are going to have lunch and during lunch or going to have a meeting and you're going to be able to come in at eleven thirty and probably ... or one o'clock\nSo I Want to see the little stickers on you that he voted or what you to tell me that after a while if you're going to go vote so that voting day and that will be at the royal Arlene and south St Louis and we're going to be talking about are you ready for this eight\nThousand days what does the eight thousand days ... you come to that meeting and a ... it's a public so come and have lunch with us\nIt's what we do folks when we don't ask you if you want to open up an investment account we'll talk you will call you\nYou do what you want to do and then if you like if your caller from say hey I Want to meet you where you get from that hey I Hope you enjoy yourself in that and\nThen the next day\nAh we have a private meeting only for our clients and then Wednesday November fourteenth okay folks this November the fourteenth this is my main thing that is not an investment there is absolutely nothing about the investment meeting\nA at this meeting nothing about it that's what this is called generations and you will love it you will enjoy you will laugh all the way through it this lady based shelled travels all over the United states\nHowever again remember those homes dropped more\nThan other homes yeah so the foreclosed homes lost more value\nIncreased more when they came back but you have to understand how much more they went down and the other thing that came up is it people that went into that business are already in that business at that time tab on the whole made more money\nUm on selling the homes than the people who let's say went into it the last year or two\nUm they didn't get the bottom of the market or near the bottom they went down so their recovery hasn't been that good\nSo those are kind of things that I think we really need to look at to see because there's a lot of lot of folks we talking dealt to do a lot of folks that are in that business and they are very very happy with that business maybe there are people who retired\nUh and that's what they're doing now so they're not they're retired from their job that they had for twenty Thirty years and you know people that are still retiring now many of those people work at the same job they did Thirty years ago so many of those folks have tensions\nAre but some of them don't and do more and more we go into the future in our opinion we're gonna see less and less tensions in in my opinion\nA for retirees so it's going to be very very important for people to take care of or taking a advantage of Irene programs for one programs individual savings programs are young people today\nMe to participate in my opinion in IRAs and in four one K. programs and in individual savings\nAnd need only by what they need all of us only need to buy what we need\nA far in cash and not to not let that debt build up so all of a sudden all we know debt debt debt we never get behind our from behind an eight ball a lot of things that we have to be able to do folks\nAh and it takes a lot of patients\nA lot of discretion\nOr because it's easy to go out and buy what you want\nYou know I remember all this was Twenty years ago one of one of our one of my doctor client\nWas building a beautiful home and he was about fifty eight years old\nHe took in Thirty years to build this beautiful home and he said after he went out to look at it with his son in law to be\nAnd the son in law said basically oh I Love that I think I'm going to be able to buy that in a couple of years and he looked at him and said\nSon his take me over Thirty years you get here he said yeah but I can get a big nose a big mortgage\nA and as long as I keep my job I can afford to live and stuff like that I think about that they can ... the young people can live in the home they can drive a big cars they can go on vacations but when they lose\nThey don't drive a big cars\nThey can go on vacation but when they lose their job they could lose everything has got to make sure that the young people only by what they need and paid far in cash and extremely extremely important\nNow one of the thing I Want to continue to cover as we get closer to the end of the year remember there are certain things that we can do\nA and a ... in my opinion to keep more money in our pocket\nSo we've got the ... year coming what can we do January first that we can do now well one of the things we can do is provide for charity\nAnd providing for charity is extremely extremely important I think for everybody\nOr when you travel the world\nAnd my wife Janet I had been able to travel the world who have been very very fortunate um we've been married for fifty four years\nWe've been travelling for fifty four years with the various investment company brokerage offices and things like that uh we've been given the opportunity to travel to China and the orient Pacific William\nUh Australia New Zealand South America all through North America Canada a Europe Russia\nScandinavian countries Africa I mean we've been very very fortunate and when you're fortunate like that we travel all around the world if there are some beautiful places in the world there are some beautiful lakes some beautiful mountains some beautiful\nUh homes there are some great restaurants but I'm going to tell you this\nThe best bad in the world is your bet right here in the United states the meal is your kitchen\nBecause see that years\nAnd that that whole regardless of what value is is your whole right here in St Louis and the reason that so important is because when you travel when you get the opportunity to travel all around the world you see where people live what they lived in some\nPeople live in mud hut and I'm not just talking about Africa okay some people don't have food and the food to eat some people don't have enough water to drink when we do here in the United states do appreciate what we have\nAnd help people who need help\nTo charity is extremely extremely important to have an extremely important to be able to give to help others and this time of year is very very important we're getting ready to go the water is turning cold as we all know\n'em and\nJackets codes gloves boots anything that you can do own use it doesn't make any difference\nPeople made these things so let's give to charity and that's one thing that we can do between now and the end of the year that provide tax reduction if you want to talk about\nYou know if you get certain things you can get some kind of tax deduction now you have to talk to your CPA to find out what kind of tax deduction that is but one of the things you might want to do\nIs talk ... events hey give I give a bundle of clothes away or if I get some money to charity\nIs there some way I can deduct it your CPA will know the things that are extremely extremely important it is I take a break when we come back we have a guest that\nIt's supposed to be calling and I'm I'm sure Mr Mr ... was held up today because it's a very difficult\nUh to get him on the line and ah he needs to call three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven three one for nine six magnitude five eight\nSeven seven but in the meantime we're right we're going to\n[noise]\nWhen you were referring to him for

opportunity and you know if you're going to think about diversifying overseas and the ways that we are discussing your you have to be opportunities to do that one is personal ... you know we're talking about retiring to a new country that's diverse find your lifestyle and a very big way and that has a lot of benefits an upside\nBut they're also practical financial potential benefits and so the other way to diversify a internationally is through an investment\nAnd so when you think about real estate again you're looking at it from both perspectives\nIf you're going to move overseas to live as a retiree maybe you want to buy a home of your own so it's an opportunity to diversify into another property market at this stage of life bottom line to give you a place to live as a ... full time resident retiree in that place\nAt the same time you know a lot of markets around the world offer real estate markets\nOffer very interesting opportunities right now there are some markets that are severely undervalued there are some markets where the U.S dollar is a very strong now historically strong\nCreating opportunities to buy low with us struck with a relatively strong currency and so to look then for upside in terms of capital appreciation in term thanks to your currency as well as you know movement in the market\nAnd as well to generate cash flow there are lots of great markets around the world for buying rental properties right now\nFor a I mean here's a question for this type of lifestyle living overseas\nParticipating diversifying waking up or maybe to a brand new life\nIs that uh maybe your your existing life a consistent but maybe it's boring him from what I'm hearing from you you can be excited about living overseas what do you own or rent or a steak ah this\nThis lifestyle doesn't sound like it's only limited to ... retirees either\nDo exactly that is a ... that's a really important point I think thanks to a twenty first century technology the Internet age all of that it's possible to to diversify in this way to make these to make a move overseas and definitely to make investments overseas at any age and I've been covering this feat\nFor more than Thirty years and way back then in the beginning a Thirty Years' ago\nNumber one people thought this was crazy [laughter] everyone I talked to about the idea just thought you know why would someone do that this you know if I'm going to retire outside the home town where I've lived my whole life maybe I'll think about retiring to Florida or Arizona but uh as well as we've been discussing basically overseas is today's Florida\nUh but the other point about Thirty years ago was that when I was talking about these ideas I was speaking specifically to retirees you know twenty and thirty and forty somethings\n... this didn't resonate with them at all but today it's anyone of any age and baby boomers are the the retired the generation of retirees\nMost interested in these ideas of any generation of retirees in history for a number of reasons one they've traveled more than any generation before them\nToo they uh they have many more years of healthy ... living ahead of them so that they've got more retirement fund to than any generation before them so they're looking for you know outside the box opportunities in ideas for how to do that\nSo baby boomers are kind of increasingly all in on this as a as an option but as well millennials even I my business is based in Panama or the country of Panama Panama City Panama\nWhich is where I Am right now we have in our office here and I've got a staff of about thirty five most of them are twenty and thirty some things from North America and Europe\n... their millennials who it to me it's still I have trouble still some days when I Walk in the office looking around at my American Canadian German French\nBritish and Irish staff thinking how all these people end up here in Panama City Panama and it's because of what we're discussing because it is so very possible I won't say it's easy because there are challenges it's not easy\nBut it's very possible and the benefits are very big of of doing these kinds of things today\nAnd I know that the enthusiasm kind of I'm all for there are a lot of Americans but live I'm gonna go call it a lack of a terminology up in the mountains up in the hills here and it is beautiful country\nIt is up in the highlands of Panama in the area around ... cafe is the main town there it's beautiful the weather's better here in Panama City it's hot and humid all the time and that's definitely not for everyone\nHad in my city is a great place for business but in the mountains and on the coast of Panama is still a really good option for for a living and retiring\nLean how can we find out more what can our money talkers to to find out more [noise]\nWell I think the first ... easy as best as you go online and Google this idea retire overseas best places to live overseas\nAnd today you find I and less and less resources including my group which is living in best overseas and I publish a daily you let her every day from wherever I Am in the world I send out any of that or a free I have about four hundred thousand readers are mostly Americans\nAnd I talk about these ideas you know every day it's a different a destination and a different way of looking at that destination so we talk about everything from you know all the lifestyle things we're discussing you know finding a place to live and making friends and becoming part of your community\nTo the practical things like opening a bank account getting your utilities installed and then that kind of administrative things you have to deal with health care health insurance establishing residency if you want to live in the place full time\nHealth care health insurance I stopped watching residency if you want to live in a place full time dealing with taxes back in the states as an American abroad you're always going to carry your tax obligation ... at least you're filing obligation for Uncle Sam with you so all of the topics are and we have lots of stories\nLots of stories of Americans who've already made this new who are already living retired in different places around the world and again it's free so you know read it for a while if it resonates with you if you start to think wow\nAll these people are doing this and look this is interesting then taken a step as we were discussing earlier take one small step and see where it leads\nIf you think All right this is interesting sounds great for them but this is not for me then you're just on subscribe\nAnd live and invest overseas that will do that's it yeah that will do it and invest overseas\nCanceling court thank you so much for

I think by the way that we have to document is worth it to make sure that you have an investment in the property that has nothing to do with it it really doesn't ask do with money laundering yeah sure that you know it's not drug money that's coming into the system okay\nSo he comes in and I asked him well where is the money for the down\nUp and it was a two hundred and sixty thousand dollar house is going to ask what the ... the modest nice house yeah he's got put twenty percent down fifty two thousand and he wants to know and I need to know where the money's coming from so he says well I got a bank account with\nAbout that amount of money in it and I said okay\nIt was it with bank of America up and down the application he then goes ahead and I gave them a list of what I'm going to need it so it gives me W. twos it gives me pay stubs I told them are going to need\nDocumentation to source where the money's coming from downpayment among all you know what I forgot to bring my bank statements out scanned them an email empty and I said fine I work so we go through the numbers we lock the rank he's very happy he understands how it's going to work\nHe leaves she leaves\nTwo minutes later that can come [laughter] you're not you're not gonna believe this raw okay we're two minutes later he comes back\nTo the store and this is a great story and he says to me look\nI Am going to give you my assets statements but\nYou cannot tell my fiance where the money is or how they're so they're not married yet they're not married okay because the money I'm going to use is from a trust uh-huh that trust was given to me by my grandfather who was a physician I'm the only grandchild ...\nHe basically owned the town that he was in and he left me all the money and the trust yeah now I Can't access the trust Tom Thirty years old okay but I'm allowed to take money out for a down payment is twenty three now he's twenty three\nNow part of the condition of the trust is that whoever I marry cannot have knowledge of the trust until they're married for six months\nWhile that's interesting okay this is a cool that's already six\nPoint two million dollars\nBy point to so he just said fifty grand it's not a sesame unless I'm going to keep the house for seven or eight six seven years the mortgage paid off I was\nA that was in the story we\nClosed below when that happens when it when it when you when you have a trust because there's actually this works for me to when I can you have a six point two million I don't I wouldn't say that but I have I have a trust I feel I'm curious\nWhen he tells you that is their documentation that he had that so he has to provide a trust of as a trustee\nYeah we have to show disbursement trust into account for him he just gets information from wherever that is and they got to see and then by that point was that six months later the highest fiance is in for a heck of a surprise [laughter]\nThis is a good human being right and I didn't get into details are praying operating and that kind of ... you know that was pretty that's a pretty big surprise that the interest but I'm you know only buy two hundred and sixty

and we need to talk about this and and I and this is going to be one of the main topics will do the McGraw thing and kind of give you a synopsis of the\nEr of what we're going to do on like a shopping by later later that's what I heard it was if you will see if you want to emphasize\nIs the Federal Reserve and what they did last week okay okay so we had been telling you all on that the Federal Reserve is threatening to raise the interest rate benchmark right and then we need it right okay and they needed emitted from two percent or two and a quarter percent okay okay\nThey also mentioned that they're going to probably raise it at least one more time this year okay so let me read more tied in December December three more times\nIn two thousand Nineteen okay\nAnd may be another time\nIn two thousand do you have an average of what they raise it by or is it just it's different no matter what happened and a quarter percent seems to be it's a conservative increase I seen I I think through history that down as much as a half percent guy that was what I you don't want to just slammed the door yet another large in Korea now\nA number of customers a number of customers have told\nThey are asked me that they have absolutely no idea what the heck the benchmark rate on the Federal Reserve rate is what it's going to do it any more than me or anything so we're going to spend a lot of time on this program today\nJust discussing how all this works good All right so the Federal Reserve requires banks to have a certain amount of cash\nPreserve requires banks to have a certain amount of cash every single day\nAt days at business day it's kind of like a casino they have to have a certain amount of money to do is they they do they have to have a ... and it's funny that I learned that from oceans eleven which is all in all the oceans eleven while literally bait on site and I said to have like somewhere upwards of a hundred million in cash\nTo for people gambling and then during the week it's like something like fifty million just to ... to find that entertaining side yeah just confined in case someone wins out so I was just\nSouth anyway you can continue so he you know so the Federal Reserve requires a certain amount of cash by each bank came out banks\nThe banks biggest business is to do what is to lend money course okay and they would love to land as much as they can yeah nine\nEffect cash requirements is such that they don't have enough because they lengths that all day that day the way they get the additional cash is they borrow from other ... which are good that's what they want right that's the benchmark rate yeah if the Federal Reserve raises\nHelpful ... only offered personalized service from dependable trustworthy stop were welcoming pen

that St Louis for him [laughter]\nI don't know how are you I'm doing great I got to tell you I like to be on your show by the new being on my show why why it was just a change of pace that's education\nOh he asked the questions and said yeah you got us questions right so are we just got done talking about two hours earlier and then I Want to tell you a funny story who who are trying to buy one of your shows yes\nI mentioned something about rocket ship mortgage it wasn't\nAnd one of your shows yes I mentioned something about rocket ship mortgage it was a while ago mhm and how I had a situation where\nThat's the one where you said this isn't the name but but we call it rocket ship more gr here\nAnd everybody knows who we are talking about right okay somebody from rocket ship mortgage got wind or something\nNew like way right away right [laughter] so now I just want to remind your brief of the story where I was refinancing somebody they called rocket ship mortgage and rocket ships mortgage was there right was a quarter percent higher score and they were charging thirty eight hundred dollars in fees\nOkay how much do you charge officials here oh that's where I had a lot of [laughter] everybody was higher alright\nSo rocket ship mortgage cause may\nFirst and and and and currently the got wind or something okay and they said to me\nLess than other rockets mortgages listening much of a vice president or something I I I sort of Mr rocket image and where it was a weird called it was\nSo he says look I'm the vice president of the national sales rocket ship ... okay and what we know that you do a lot of business you know there's a rumor that I'm I guess the number one in Missouri\nNot rumors fact ... lack of asserts I don't want to create anyway I Do have a regular and the best deal with it\nRight that's the way it is and they wanted to know whether or not I was interested in selling them my loans so we were closing fund it and they would buy it from us okay\nWell you don't care who buys it\nIs is I Do know the ... a mortgage is a security right and rent one of the reasons that rates are so low is that it is a tradable security camera and nobody actually use it their own money and that's for sure it ties in that loan on Wall street who in the service thing they get a service premium okay\nWhy would I possibly sell it to a mortgage company that's trying to take advantage of other consumers and tactics\nSo you're so because they would take it in and try and sell something given to me or something\nWell what they would do is if I have a customer and the customers comes to me if I go ahead and refinance that customer later they're going to try to refinance their customers switch but more importantly because of the practice that they have of trying to charge\nA lot of the oil is rising right and much higher rates in order for them to make better commissions why would I Want to and and the service things of that loan has not have the best of best response\nAs well as far as I've talked to for it why would I Want to put my customer into that and why why would you I Would say no to those people I mean I ... I was saying is I I I thought it was pretty funny yeah and then you know I ... well\nIt's a huge compliment it is safe from that one because they were like hey you're you're doing better than everybody else and you're a big going down that that in other offices or just sort of there's sort of like um if you can't beat them join them a it's a wonderful life when Mr Potter comes to\nA George

you how to swim African American so these mortgage programs the majority of lenders are ... that offer that\nThere is a set up charge and it's a way to set up a charge what you don't realize is every time they take a payment as your account okay right charge you a two dollars and Ninety five feet now here's how it works\nBy weekly if you have a two thousand dollar mortgage payment right my weekly means every two weeks they're going to take a thousand dollars out of your account ...\nAttack on that two dollars and Ninety five cents okay well I Know you're a smart guy right I think you're pretty

I wasn't always the swamps and while it was ... it was sort of swamp land of\nThe world's fair was there so those two really you know it was that was in the sixties were talking yeah these are the forties and the other thirties he would play there that's because he grew up in a store you and a story or\nIs there and it's sort of row houses in ten and houses and right it's a working class neighborhood right you would\nYou go to the same high school in New York now I Am a Brooklyn blind on the on the Long Island that we don't really associate with a guy I don't know I used to call we still called Jewish folks from Long Island\nJabs okay prints are princesses seriously they were all the stuck up and I don't yeah to anywhere or arm loans are coming into play now homes\nAll right they are they are starting to become more favorable will yeah because the interest rates are going I'm going to start or you don't know how people think the arm loans are dangerous because oh I'm going to go in and get this loan and next month or my payments going to go from twelve hundred to two thousand dollars a month right okay so they have hybrids\nThey have combination fixed rate adjustable rate mortgage arm stands for an adjustable rate mortgage she got to think now right get well how can you have an adjustable rate and the fixed rate I saw him again there's there's a very good product called the five one arm\nIt sticks to five years right and then then it turns into that adjustable guy now fear not because that adjustable have cats\nIs that adjustable guy now fear not because that adjustable has kept me and you can't go from five percent or four percent twenty percent right bath cats as to how much they can go per year and over the life of the law\nYou can't get killed liquor during that five year period\nYou get the advantage of a better rate than the thirty year fixed loan so it's advertised over Thirty years so you're making payments as if it's a thirty year fixed rate\nYou get the rate of a Fifteen year and this is where she gets forward you get the rate of a Fifteen year which is a half a percent better than a thirty year fixed rate now\nIs that is that a law or is that just the way the animal out now that that's the way it works out okay so the for five\nYears you're right it's not going to change and it's a better rate than a thirty year fixed\nRight okay so what's a five year arm now\nWhy it all depends on the ... the amount of borrow but let's say a thirty year fixed rate for argument's sake is foreign three quarters for four and a quarter a five year on hookah if you're and this is what we've got a lot of for some reason the last three weeks probably because the interest rates of shooting up right there are a ton of people\nIn their late sixties that intends to retire and the next three to five years they moved to Florida or they're going to downsize but and they prefer actually somebody just refinance from your show they prefer\nTo get a better rate for five year period knowing they're going to sell their house after five\nYears well that's I get that that makes sense right if you're going to move within five years are you going to retire and go to Florida and sell the house and whatever else yeah when I get a cheaper mortgage for the next three to five years that's what it's for right that's what it's for I bought\nIt and this is where I'm never going to I mean I got so you got me such a great it's a killer right I'm not allowed to move because if I Move out to go back to Iran or outside but I Would be afraid to get it it's almost like leasing a car right 'cause\nYou have long said ma ... it's not a good idea like\nBecause I Know at least a car great but I I can only drive ten thousand miles on that are yeah\nWell this is mostly for people that are ... first of all before we can get that the average loan I bet you don't know how long the average won't\nLast enjoy I Do know four years ago I did tell you that I tell you\nThat no I think the first person whoever gave me a mortgage told me that for years yeah 'cause I got a five year I'm like well no he's like look here's the deal life changes you're going to change you can be in this house for years like no this is the house or the rest of my life a year and a half later I moved to St\nLouis [laughter] and now they're\nActually four point one two years OK okay if you want to be specific but that's the history of the last twenty to Thirty years now that the economy is conservative away or steam rolling but\nFour years from now there are not anticipating rates to be lower in the past people refinancing it was easier you're going to see people sticking around a little", "show_name": "The McGraw Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "14"}
