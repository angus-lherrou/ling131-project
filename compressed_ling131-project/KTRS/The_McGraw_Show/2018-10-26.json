insurance because you don't have to buy insurance who pays for that line bike paid for that no I Do\nSo they asked so make sure you don't buy your insurance because it's too expensive on the line and go up\nThe careful on this ... and ... by wear a helmet and\nYou know what I I think that it probably makes some sense in that regard but here we go why don't they don't pious as simply call strikes\nUm well there you know there's I mean we we get to how many full comments do you see in a ball game and I you know of because they go on to and then you you got all of us now it's three and two it's just you know you're just in the number of pitches\nI I I don't know if I if I buy that that probably has a\nLaw that makes me so that is straight from the manager of the Astros that is the ... was AJ happy Jay ... that that guy saying that's him being quoted in front of the world series champion the Washington we ought to know what it is in the LA Times today and I'm reading straight from the top\nGame one of the world series ended after midnight in Boston invoking the annual ritual of anguish in the parts of America that border on the Atlantic ocean\nHow can kids even adults they up so late to watch the games why don't you start the games earlier pretty civil\nGoes on to say there's a little bit of east coast prejudice in these questions commissioner Rob Manfred told\nInquiring east coast reporters Wednesday before game to Mm there's an east coast bias in the whole question all really to the games are ending well past midnight on the east coast here's what he said\n[noise] I think LA is in the western time zone we are cognizant of the fact that we're trying to serve fan those fans as well I understand gain times can be difficult it's hard when games finished late but at the same token when you start the games at five o'clock eastern\nIt's in the middle of the work day in Los Angeles that's not quite right either now I have never lived in LA but five o'clock is not in the middle of the day in LA\nOh well now it would it be home and now he's saying five o'clock eastern then it's um one uh\nOne of the economy at two o'clock okay so it's limited out of the day but no\nOne's saying it should started five but\nHe says he goes on to say I'm trying to strike a balance and get the window where we can give the most people in the country a meaningful opportunity to watch\n[noise] game one lasted so long and parts of the gun and he goes on silent analytics and everything else um\nAlthough he played fifty two Super Bowls so they started every year at five twenty regardless of whether it's Green Bay a loud and right now chargers right a jets\nIt's a Sunday Sunday but his point being if it's three o'clock on the east coast right if\nIt's three o'clock on the east coast right if if you're sitting and you're the king of baseball and your argument is three o'clock on the west coast\nOr midnight on the east coast which is worse in terms of watching the game ... for a third graders or\nFor granted rather watch so what's the worst scenario well the wind doesn't midnight midnight on a Tuesday and hosts at three o'clock and I want to buy more than that though so I Do not just the man is supposed\nTo be the smartest met the man is running baseball right you need to be smarter than that Rob Manfred\nSo but and then it goes on to say that basically\nWhat he's trying to do that this is this is the argument that that they're saying\nThey're saying that look\nWe want to give everybody a chance to watch a little bit of the game in prime time\nA little bit yeah so so we don't care if you watch the end\nWe don't we don't care who watches the end and we don't care go watch is the beginning we just want you to watch some of them we just want you to watch some of it in the eight o'clock hour and that's why the games right and that's why the games start at eight o'clock because we think the best part of the game is\nIs eight o'clock and so therefore it just as long as most people watch it in primetime we don't care that you can't watch the end or the beginning\nWhich makes no sense Oh absolutely so it's three three and a nine to ... you're just supposed to say well\nRight I got to go to bed I'll read a lot of ... well you can't\nYou just physically can stay up right it would be like making a movie and saying you know what\nWe don't care if you see in the end of the movie we got your money when we eat and you already bought your popcorn now we've got to show you the end of the movie and it's ridiculous who go to our\nTen minutes and then you can see it just it wasn't an issue back in the day where I Am\nThe games weren't as long and they had some games during the day\nRoll a lot of ... yeah you know getting out of school as to get into another if you can bring an old black and white television sets a bright fifth grade geography right skip that watch Milwaukee\nAnd the ... and the games were no the games are two hours long the games were two hours and Fifteen minutes long now you are games that are for hours long prime time is only three and so at some point someone's going to lose out who's going to lose that the person who's three o'clock driving home in traffic in LA or the person that midnight physically cannot stay up at at midnight\nAnd kids you know there's no way that they are able to drop out this or a one way to settle it you put a put a clock\nOr between pitches you say you got twenty seconds so all this other stuff that you're talking at article say well we got to you know I I'm doing this ... you say hey you got twenty five seconds a well you know you understand\nThe other thing too is is is you have two giant markets you've got LA in Boston right and the ratings are down significantly\nWhy is that because the game is takes it's it's it's like watching molasses come out of a bottle right and and you're playing it at midnight so shocking that you know you're putting something boring on at midnight and you're surprised that the ratings are down\nSo a lot of people watching like on their laptops and and that sort of thing I'm not I'm not watching it on purpose I mean what can the games are on the I guess\nYeah yeah you can watch them where it was all about I think that counts towards the whatever Bogle rating system they have or whatever I don't really trust in ...\nOh my gosh listen on the radio well wall milk question is not an hour\nWell but again you're at midnight so you fit you fall asleep listening to the radio yeah they're\nJust starting at three o'clock starting to turn one two o'clock you know just\nAs it right five twenty\nFifty three superbowls says the same\nEvery year I is that right there were a terminal but there's so many opted not to watch it I honestly I I don't try to stay up all night right or like getting up 'cause we have to get up early for John here I drove to condense game if they do I know what\nThat's a that's a dangerous thing to where you don't even have to watch for hours of the game I'll watch eight minutes five minutes to recap the\nNext morning St Bernard they sort of outlet McCaskill Tibet yesterday by one of the like the hot part of it up on a tune minutes nip it on ... and that's it no we find sniff at a restaurant or bar it's all other issue [noise]\nUm baseball like in the old days and play a story gain like they ... they don't make it six in ... no I'm kidding I'm playing I well there there was an article in the wall Street Journal that said that you go to four strikes\nNewer and ... and I know I Know I Know and I know I Know they made that five or I Do but it isn't enough apparently I'm not the only one who's who's asking Rob Manfred these question also do some of the national media are getting any straight answer that other guy anyway\nSo I'm east coast bugs total these\nTotal ... that I mean basically that's what he said it was an east coast bias in this yeah 'cause no one's complaining about the game starting at five o'clock in LA\nAnd let's be honest the mid west hates this matchup the mid west or care\nOr do I care a less of a um if you you know I'd much rather watch a little humor rather watch molasses come out of a bottle in the last ... as long as we're here in uh Missouri\nKentucky Tamara way more interesting yeah um and that's well anyway Richard Clarke\nThree o'clock white clerical I was going to be around to watch the game it's already made three o'clock\nIn the area you know those are four hours long you're not going to stay in the theater for hours\nAnd I don't I don't mind a call ... those those college football games I've never complained about it being to live in ...\nThose are you know you're getting yourself all day worth and that's just the mean hey you know what it takes about a nice bottle of James and [laughter] well good how's your dog's name out there that you were just fine seven twenty eight new numbers next

I'm\nReally I mean I mean that's probably more than well that's three\nThree and does it it's probably more than what I'm Lester Holt or what Matt Lauer at the time we making\nRight and not only that she comes in at a situation where nobody likes her\nBecause she's now taken over people who already had jobs\nAnd she doesn't come from the open ... doesn't come from the the um [noise] the minor leagues if you will write so she's not home grown so she's not part of the culture and she comes walks in and she already had a bit of a interesting run at Fox\nSo it was a clash of cultures ... between the two of them remember she had that Sunday night show which went over like a lead balloon lasted maybe a few weeks yeah um they pulled back then they they gave her this show which she never looked comfortable\nI think she was miss Kass totally miss cashed she was great on Fox News she was tremendous on Fox News she had credibility she was um she was their star\nI don't know why they they try to make her into someone\nThat she wasn't I don't do they do this all the time I I don't think that's who she was on NBC and maybe that's who you know who she was hoping and trying to be but you know she was doing really in the light stuff like I'm writing segments then it just right it's just it is didn't say here's\nWhat I don't understand about and maybe other businesses do this but television radio they do this all day long and it makes no sense\nThey take somebody that is successful something mhm pay him a whole lot more money and then do the exact opposite of what made them successful in the first place yes I don't know why that how I don't know why that is Katie Couric\nIt's full ... in the first place yeah I don't know why that how I don't know why that is Katie Couric great example right in the morning show she was fantastic she was sympathetic\nShe could do the hard news but she was much more you know is featuring news much more conversational just great way to get your news in the morning and all of a sudden she wants a million a billion dollars more so then you put her as the CBS Evening news woman miss cast\nYou write she she loses personality give her a place where she can be\nAnd then she had a talk show and then she said well that was that was the last ... as well that was that was ill defined to gather all sorts of reasons you know now she's at Yahoo News which I was actually I'm actually pretty good stuff\nI don't know I don't know now that I don't know who knows but I'm Megan Kelly I'm but that Andrew ... black\nWas lacking some judgment forget this this whole situation and you and I probably disagree on\nSome of that I mean clearly what she said nobody can defend what she said shoot him and defend what she she said but at some point in this country you have to we have to somehow be able to forgive people\nWe somehow have to accept people's apology when they apologize so that we can all move on that's that's where were you when I might disagree um in some ways I don't I don't I I I'm not saying you're not somebody who I Want to put words in your mouth but I don't ... you are a very forgiving\nPerson sitting next to me every day you have to be forgiving present [laughter] so uh eight or\nNine to five fifty caked ers solitaire\nYou know I don't know you know I and I know\nI Know that you have to say something when someone sticks a microphone in your mouth and says why did why did you lose right and they're all we have well we didn't play skate hard enough\nYou know maybe there is this something structurally wrong with with this team maybe while you're right there and I mean maybe they are trying again you know the goal is ... ... you know maybe they are coaching find maybe they just aren't just don't have good talent\nRight I mean that's a real well you know the whole we're not we're not playing hard enough where you have to clean up the mistakes were not skating hard well yeah you have to say something because you can't do you say ... but you can't say sorry we just don't have the talent\nI think by Joel what he said the last little a bit there was we have to be tougher on the ice and and I think a lot of fans that go out there and and now we're over Seventeen thousand fans a site you know and the blues fans I think there are right there I think the cardinals fans and backing their home Jean yeah\nYeah I think Jimmy only about Jason Nathan's enjoy just ABC News entertainment girl good morning Jason\nHow are you\nOn fantastic it's friday\nOkay\nWhat do we know that um Halloween was going to be such a culturally it's\nI don't think we knew what was going to be as big as it was because you never know with some of these reports they do well some of them they flop and especially with the horror movies [noise]\nUm it's you know but the timing seems alright for this\nG Jamie Lee Curtis back forty years after the original tomorrow by the way is the anniversary of the release\nOf that original forty years later [noise] um it's a very kind of relevant timely story and and you know it's a good time there was a whole lot else being released and and you know it's October people like to go see scary movies\nAnd had the weekend to itself last weekend and now this weekend [noise] not a whole lot of competition nothing really coming out but it's going to challenge it a serial looking in a second weekend on top\nAnd All right what uh what's his side uh Gerard Butler movie hunter killer what's this one yeah\nGerard Butler Gary Oldman is a submarine thriller not getting great reviews were looking at maybe ten million dollars or less for the opening [noise] um so it's not really something you're probably going to want to rush out and see the other fellow opening why this weekend is a faith based film if indivisible [noise]\nSo this is really one of those weekends where if you haven't seen a lot there's a lot out there that you that is very good that you should go cat job\nHalloween if that's for you a shower is boring if you haven't seen that yet you know it's great to see that first man which is also fantastic about Neil Armstrong the very timely the hate you give all very socially kind of relevant movie which is getting good reviews as well\nAnd if you're looking for a little action that um is still out there and going strong as well so there's a bunch of options just not the new releases\nWe actually we have a clip here is uh Neil Armstrong um early in the film when he's a he's with his wife in the living room here here's a clip\n\nThere you go that's a great or I'm from those boys may come back I Know that I mean I'm an eight hour that went off it and I could you just hear the here they don't say anything even the other\nActors complain Neil you're not saying anything in this movie\nHow the guy was I mean do you want to make him into some kind of dumb sticks to for hero type guy you know you want to portray him as he is\nKnow I don't know it was in the right it was a very quiet Neil Armstrong your job to Megan Kelly for a moment what this is is she out or is she in and is she gonna get Seventy million dollars to leave\nThis is is she out or is she in and is she gonna get Seventy million dollars to leave\nShe is basically out and they see on the today show did a report this morning citing sources close to the situation which is kind of crazy 'cause it's NBC\nReport but they're saying that according to a person familiar with the matter the discussions have be gone over making Kelly's accent so we're not talking about a reassignment here we're talking about\nShe is done she is gone and now it's just a matter of the contracts and the money she apparently hired a high powered Hollywood lawyer\nHer contractors were three years for sixty nine million dollars reportedly so you know it's just about how much of that issue going to get um yeah I don't know if she has a claim for more than that necessarily they've already paid at least a year and a half out on that\nAnd this was really the controversy I think was it was a controversy it was handled I thought in a very good way and it was really more of a discussion they didn't get on TV in black face\nYou know I think it was a very different thing I think this is more of a Trojan Horse for them to get rid of her they've been wanting to do that for a while for show the ratings just never lived up to it and a lot of people that NBC never really liked her so this is an excuse for them to get rid of her\nSomebody said and I don't know who it was but they were brilliant and this is Andrew lack he should be fired for higher and her for three years for Seventy million dollars\nNot just that a whole bunch of problems with with him and his running of the news division there that a lotta people aren't happy about their handling of sexual harassment of Matt Lauer of they had the Ronan Farrow stuff on wind staying and they decided not to go with it\nI mean there's a lot of mistakes that he is made up they have a lot of people's eyes\nAnd it's kind of crazy that he's still around as well and yeah he bears responsibility for this\nAnd then they can Kelly thing that was one of those things where it was either going to work and work brilliantly or it's going to be a disaster it wasn't going to be anything necessarily\nIn the middle I'm because she was remember when they hired her she was one of the biggest President Trump a a a fair is at the time right um yeah during the election the ... that we're going at it back and forth\nSo I think a lot of people thought she wouldn't work over at NBC but that that the Fox stink just never really left or um and they did not accept\nThere I think she doesn't go back to Fox I think Jeff Zucker at CNN takes her and and and spruce up his nighttime give her back her own show and let her do what she does best exactly\nShe does need one of those nighttime politic shows it'll be interesting to see where she goes CNN I Would need a shot and they are like that I don't know it's another situation where I don't know if she would necessarily work there\nI think if she can patch things up what box she comes home hero because she was\nPushed out from the liberal NBC over a PC thing she could go back there and if if the you know the bad blood isn't too bad she can kinda right around the ticket and and that would be a big thing for them but I you know I don't know if that relationship is ...\nYou know the other thing too that if I said something stupid and it responds on the radio and somebody gave me fifty million dollars to go away you wouldn't hear from me ever again that the equivalent of winning the mega millions that exactly right yeah see so these stupid and give me fifty million dollars and I'll go ahead\nJason it's an ABC News corps one of things but I got a twenty six year big five fifty\nYears that guy that her the guy from Google who's actually arrest somebody gets Ninety million dollars to go away how do you get these jobs\nI don't know you have a really good agents you've really got a lawyer you have a really good contract and that they had\n... who knows when you're going for a job and you're like you know Mr Smith we would like to hire you as a junior executive and we think and here's your salary and everything okay great uh you know I Love this company ... hold on a second now\nIs in the future I sexually harass someone to the point where you need to find her me can we\nAn edge a severance package of Ninety million dollars I think that that sounds about right welcome to this one comes is local club\nMe let's just say when I when I get fired for sexual harassment I Need a severance package like\nThis because you now most contracts are written in the favor of those who are hiring yes\nSo I don't know who has that she's getting that's you know rest of her two year contract\nSigned with a a big company here in town not cage ers I won't tell you who was what it was a big a media company here in town I'm not going to tell you it was basically the contract says if you sneeze and we don't like it we can fire you and then and then you'll not be able to work for the next Seventeen years\nNew like great where do I sign [laughter]\nI'm In I'm all in black face if you wear two different colored black Sox we can fire you I mean that that that is that right you signed those contracts where they they own you\nAnd then and then you can't work for the next Twenty years and then they're like what we gave you a platform you're like okay this this is what I got to do and then these people make Ninety million dollars for saying that dumb as most inappropriate things in the world [noise] phone is blowing up right now eight twenty eight year makes the rest of the\nBig um need to buy a house you need to sell the house look I'm\nSome interesting times here when it comes to a real estate rights it's hot in markets hot and some places not so much in other places cooling off interest rates are going up so right you need\nA need to have your agents head on a swivel that's work at the big comes in because she's got a full team of experts buying agents and listening agents of showing agents and this is the full team she is fantastic she's been doing this a long long time so if you are in the market for the home\nOf your dreams maybe your I'm moving up maybe your downsizing whatever it may be a Kennedy how big that will be out at least color and see what she can do for at least have that first conversation with her through in four two seven six old too on four two seven six old for Kathy he'll be group dot com\nHey there's guys all of your home improvement project you've been putting off and wait any longer right now at universal windows to run you buy one window you get one free no limits\nZero percent financing for thirty six months was available\nWell it depends on what season are referring to but the uh the main season and most people think about is the November portion of fire and deer season and that's November tense\nWho's a twenty if that's a ten day period in November that seems awful shores uh that's typically what it is for years yeah four days that's for the main firearms deer season we have other deer seasons for example this weekend we've got the youth season that Saturday and Sunday\nAnd we have two portions of the season that's designed mainly for young hunters six Fifteen Years old\nThey get them a chance to get outdoors without all the adults hunting too and it's kind of a fostering mentoring type opportunity for them so they do have to be a with a a licensed adult hunter though you know it but it gives them a chance to be out in the woods and do a little hunting and kind of get introduced to the sport\nI Can't believe all the ... the deer hunters talk all year long and live for just ten days\nAnd you know pretty much yeah that's our biggest season that's when the majority of hunters are out there but you know actually the whole overarching their season\nReally begins September fifteenth and goes to January Fifteen that would be the postseason the archery see how they um you know the archery hunters are relatively small group of the overall hunting ...\nYeah and it's such a short amount of time there's so many people out there so there's a mix of safety issues I Would think well you\nKnow safety is always the number one thing not getting the day or whatever it's being safe and um\nYou know a lot of people obviously associate hazards with firearms and that's certainly true you need to respect your firearm but the biggest source of accidents and injuries and hunting is actually falling from tree stands that investment if you know he stands do more damage to people and firearms do basically thirty idea\nIs that you go up into the stand in a tree and then you look for the deer\nHad you looked down on the air and it kind of gives you a you're not at all there is a line of sight and you've got a good point of view and you can shoot down safely 'cause your backdrop is now the ground rather than the God oh that's why people like the deer stands\nAnd there are great tools for hunting but you do have to apply a certain level of caution and preventative measures to keep accidents from happening\nAnd so one of the biggest things that we tried to urge people to do is use what they call a ... a fall arrest system which is a fancy word for a harness that safety harness the ranks you locked into the tree as you climb up the tree the entire time you're on the stand because people have been known to fall asleep in the stands and fall out and then the entire time you're coming down and\nI mean how how high up are the ... you know they can\nBe like ten feet in the ... possibly you know so it just depends on the tree and\nWell and I think are you trying to get the perfect shot so you're leaning your hedging you're right you're on the edge of the seat and all of a sudden one too far and your your\nAnd your offer you know possibly wet damp conditions making slippery\n... said was make sure your guns not loaded as you're climbing into the trees then\nWe'll see now there's the other big thing an addition to keeping yourself tethered at all times to the tri stand with a a an adequate or a harness system this rated for your weight and everything properly but you also whenever you're carrying your gear up especially your firearms or bows and arrows and everything\nYou want to do that separately you have what's called the whole language basically when you you tight line to your gear and when you get up there you pull it up with a whole line and um you don't try to carry your firearm or your Bowen arrows on your person as you go up and down the stand\nThe other thing is you want to make sure your firearms or unloaded that's another common source of of problems is the ... someone trying to haul up or carry up loaded firearm an accident happens\nIn the fire on discharges and hurt somebody else has to make sure that the tree is living and healthy yes and that's another thing so I Know it's obvious but\nIt seems obvious but so you got different things you got like a permanent tri stand you can build in a tree with lumber and all that uh or whatever materials or you can get a portable tri stand the Jim Carrey and install either way if you're using a portable stay and make sure the ... and and nuts and everything or titan properly\nIf you've got a permanent tri stand up there and make sure that you build up two years ago that that lumber still sound the nails are still sound and everything is still structurally good\nAnd of course and make sure the tree is living in healthy 'cause you don't want to be up in an on healthy treat or could something could break on you and you know\nDo I have to wear an orange hat\nYes you need to wear a hunter orange and that's three hundred and sixty degree visibility not just a you know something on the front\nAnd it could be a jacket it can be a vast but it needs to be three hundred and sixty degree hunter orange including a cap and why is that\nThat so you were visible in the woods obviously there aren't orange so you're not going to be mistaken for a deer if you're carrying on people will be able to see from a distance there's a hunter they're so hypothetical you've got it here in front of you are you ready to take a shot you see the hunter orange back there you know nope don't take that shock because that's a dangerous\nWhen that happened someone who is taking a that's another thing\nWe we urge folks to do is when you are hunting make absolute sure of your target don't just assume all I heard something moving that severe you know and shoot are I think that's a deer or not you're about to take a shot anyway no you don't do that you make sure you can confirmed and severe before you shoot and you also need to be aware of what's behind it\nTo him well Dick and Dick Cheney vice president shot somebody well hunting and I can happen to anybody dating shows I I've been pheasant hunting they say never ever ever ever ever ever hunt from your car\nNo no that's that's not really bad yeah it's not leaving legal like oh okay yeah that's good to know how many cars and vehicles not legal so special roads and all that but um you know in some cases you might have a blind like a turkey blind dream you know would have or some are even deer hunting from a blind is is a possibility you know\nUm how many here are are you allowed to capture\nWell it depends on how to do whatever you know it depends really on the individual hunting season your end so are the best thing there is to check our check our regulations which are available in our twenty Eighteen fall during turkey pamphlet which can be found or any permanent retailer any conservation office or you can find out online too so\nYeah I Know there may be a silly question but I'm I'm sure hunters want to go out early in the morning you have to wait until you have to wait till the rise yeah as I Know yeah I'll tell\nYou what we we we still you were talking about here and be careful deer driving I have seen here are just everywhere I mean there may be it's going to live in Colorado a saint saint Charles I mean I'm seeing them they're all over the place well\nIt's going to women caught a little uh saint saint Charles I mean I'm seeing them they're all over the\nPlace well they are and what we have an an interesting situation in those populated areas that are ... that are still near some more a undeveloped areas because we have a situation where the deer flourish\nWe have a really good healthy population they got the habitat they're really good condition but there is no predators\nThat we have in the state anymore and we hunting becomes complicated in those areas we can't have normal hunting rodeo I'm announcing is our normal number one way of managing the deer population so you do run into this conflict where you have these areas where you see a lot of deer ball when a town of countries the classic example that you're mentioning coddled ill\nSo the the only way we have to really regulate those populations is with hunting and usually it's up to the municipality to allow bow hunting so the way that works is this concentration ... the overall arching regulations for the deer season and deer hunting and whatever kind of hunting\nBut individual municipalities or whatever can be more restrictive so ... example like during the fire and ... and well we say hey you can go hunt deer with firearms during those ten days but if you go hunting coddled bill perhaps they may say no you can't we don't allow firearms news charge so\nLet me ask you a very uh very city slicker question and I apologize can you you can't\nHunt children here right does and write little baby can hunt deer yeah you can you can on baby there yes really does yeah I don't see how people she or does the female dares or does it does our\nFemale daring yes okay female but you can ... a younger day or two\nYou can have a real yeah no it isn't like fish where you have to throw the the the small fish but I Know\nThere are certain counties that do have our what they call an or point restrictions where you have to have you're shooting at a uh about to have to have a certain number of points visible you know in order and and the and the reason we do that is to preserve the the males males yeah and so we don't\nEarn so there's only so many shows so you can shoot males female than children here\nAre younger and younger yeah you can invest in those areas and again that varies by certain counties will have an ... restrictions in there and that
