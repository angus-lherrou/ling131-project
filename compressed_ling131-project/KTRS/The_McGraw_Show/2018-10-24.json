standing by ... ... yeah All right first let's start with President Trump um\nFlip flopping all over the place first let's start with his claim that the a group of migrants who are working their way up in this quote unquote chairman some of them are middle Easterners what's been\nSaid this the other day he was asked to explain it and he'd get into the administration has asked many times to say where is the evidence of that and the\nCat and you know responded in a Broadway Sarah Sanders said absolutely there's evidence for what is it they didn't get it and yesterday the president conceded he doesn't have proof of that he says that they very well could be a part of the Caribbean but there's no proof of anything\nI think if you step back a little bit\nThe evidence of this statements from the president what is very clear is that the president is going to use this caravan as a rallying cry for Republican voters heading into that term election he's going to find a way to talk about this every day either tweet or a public statement and he's certainly getting a lot of questions still about it\nAnd as we've seen from Republicans and we've talked to former Trump campaign advisers and Republican strategist who have called this a political gift for their party heading into this very critical election\nAlright that's where that is now let's talk about uh his his comments about Saudi Arabia and is is\nUh the investigation there he he's he's talking almost and I don't mean this is a dumb disrespectful but he's almost talking like Tony Soprano in terms of um in terms of retribution for all of this\nYeah and I think his comments yesterday really clarified what he's thinking on this what he's planning on doing he yesterday called the um the show the is situation one of the worst cover ups ever he said they had a very bad original concept was carried out poorly\nA cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups and he said somebody really messed up and they should be in trouble\nHe was later whether he meant that the cover up should have been better you know like what would the signaling that he didn't like about that the the murder or how they handle that\nAnd he said it should never have happened again still talking about the cover up but he did call this a total fiasco from day one\nWhoever put this in their mind that was not a good side but we don't have any more on what's going to actually happen he the president seems to be pushing that can each day a little bit more of or waiting for more information at last week it was the secretary of state ... ethnic ... and the region when he gets back\nWe'll talk about it now it's the CIA director who was in Turkey this week when she gets back we'll have more information about the investigation but it's pretty clear the president is not right now publicly indicating he's leaning towards\nFierce harsh sanctions on the kingdom or doing anything that would I disrupt or water down that weapons deal he announced last year with Saudis\nYeah I'm also expect him to talk about uh the espionage with a no show jobs in that he needs to keep that going on with Saudi Arabia right they need to be punished but boy let's not touch the arms deals\nAnd you know they is also the interesting part of this to who is that a that need to be punished we heard the secretary of state yesterday say that the visas that some of the officials who were implicated in this would be revoked but the president has made it very clear from day one that he believes the king crown prince when they tell him\nThey had nothing to do it that he said yesterday that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told them it was at a lower level and that's just been greeted with incredible skepticism by experts in the region and Republicans on Capitol Hill who say there is just no way that the crown prince perhaps the king might not have known but the crown prince\nIs effectively in charge there there are officials who were in Turkey and you can see the videos of than a poor very close to him it's just hard to imagine how you wouldn't have any knowledge of this\nCar drivers NBC News correspondent at the White House ...

Lodi infused\nAbout that they think this is a congressional registering has nothing to do with it and they also believe that state reps in states centers draw their own districts and that does not have an\nIdea how does the process work now how do we draw the districts now\nSo the way it works now is that after the census says over uh the numbers are brought out and the two parties receiving the largest number of votes which is always going to be Republican and Democrat for the foreseeable future by they send names both parties and names into the governor the governor chooses five of those names five Republican names five Democrat names\nThey formed this commission that get together and use a demographer you know about you know how to these all stack up go with the federal guidelines for drawing district to make sure they're fair and minority representation so forth\nAnd then they tried to draw map if they are unable to draw mapping it takes seven of the commissioners to agree on that map\nThen it goes to the backup or fallback position and that six appeals court judges appointed by the Supreme Court against supposed to be balanced on on party and they ended up drawing the maps and so it was clean Missouri doesn't by the way clean Missouri You will not see that on the ballot you'll only see amendment one\nBut but what really Missouri does is it eliminates the appeals court backup it actually it keeps the commission's but the commissions are just for dress only because they can't change anything that the this one person this one state demographer draws up that they cannot change it unless they get seven to ten both\nWho then decides who hires this state demographer\nWill start with the auditor the state auditor will choose an auditor candidates and that those candidates will be submitted to the president pro tem of the Senate and to the ... minority leader of the Senate and between the two of those they get to throw a people out\nUh and and then the the person that has left if they can't decide\nThey stayed out of church is is that person so that's pretty easily gamed right I I put in three people into this mix I put in somebody I Know you don't like I put in somebody I Know the other guy doesn't like and so they throw those two guys and the guy like states right\nA sound like the way we do it now is a pretty bipartisan way we do it now\nCurl Darren with us executive director of United for Missouri you've made the text won\nA tell Karl I'm Sorry about the mess on his street he will be done soon Tom in St Peter's so very good thank you Tom ... they're making good progress and then uh do you really arrived when people criticize you on the tax line that tell car all its Missouri Missouri so there you go well I didn't grow up in St Louis Missouri [laughter]\nAll right we're talking about some of the amendments and some of the the proposition that we're talking about a we have this right amendment one which is the clean a Missouri title I'm which a lot of people are are are I\nI think don't understand the facts of if Enron have sort of made their decision before they know some of the facts you said something last segment\nAnd you said if you don't like gerrymandering now just wait for this amendment to pass what do you mean by that well\nThey're trying to artificially and subjectively insert fair and competitive if you will and show you know the gerrymandering that's going to occur uh ... if clean Missouri memo one passes is that they're going to try to protect the minority districts which they have to do under federal law\nSo it's it's the proverbial putting a a ten pounds of stuff into a five pound bag right and so if you protect certain districts and you're pushing a ... year affair and competitive a notion out into the rest of the state\nThat means you're going to have districts that range could range from Jennings all the way almost to Columbia and all sorts of gerrymandering or the or like that will occur and communities of interest while they're still in\nThe ... I'm clean Missouri which means you and I share common values we share a common goals we want the best for our district those are still in there but they will be a watered down a lot\nWith a suit you're saying there can be a district that could encompass Hannibal, Missouri with north St Louis city\nThere there there could be in a matter of fact the northern Missouri is probably a good good example because you know the population has declined over the years and you can have them stretch from from down to St Louis you them stretch over to Tim overly you could have a district school on a thirty six you know already to\nKansas City and so the the argument would be how does somebody represent the best interests of Hannibal and north city in Jefferson City 'cause there's two different worlds right\nSo you know our our son districts are already about a hundred and fifty thousand people such a lot of people are already so if you stretch that out I mean it's hard enough to cover now but if you stretch that out you're gonna make it even harder for state senators to to get around to their to their ah yeah 'cause they're dressed state rep districts are not so hard to hear their they tend to be compact because of our dense they but they can be stretched out across state and\nAnd what is it was an urban guy no about farming\nSeems like you're getting a lot of you are ... are being against this up amendment one is getting a lot of support from Republicans and Democrats that so we have lacy clay\nYeah I think a lot of support from\nRepublicans and Democrats\nThat so we have lacy clay we ... we have Republicans boarding and we have a Democrats or Republicans opposing it Republican or Democrats opposing it as well because there is a lot of danger in this I mean again the system we're using\nA no systems ever perfect system we're using now has served to stay well which again we've seen Democrat majorities we've seen Republican majority is a things will swing back\nOr if we want to make sure that we have to maintain the integrity of our representative process and our communities of interest and everything else is important to us we should defeat amendment was\nAlso in this amendment one a curl beard and you've been awful quit not to mention it's going to clean up some of the ethics rules right there there's a bunch of bunch of unethical people down there is this going to claim that uh\nUh actually it ah it portends to pretend to do but it but it doesn't do a lot you know one of the things that does is lower contribution limits are we just passed two years ago or one of them at large my hundred dollars another large by six hundred dollars not not significant it all everything in this bill regarding the full ethics\nReforms was ready to be passed and the Senate this year and would have been law today had the proponents in the Senate there are a couple of senators over there who are proponents of claims are um\nAre they not stopped at by a thread a filibuster we would already have the revolving door to two years we would already have a lower our limited a lobbyist gifts we would already have almost everything that's in this measure now would be law today because it would become law August when you're\nYou're saying there were senators who are out promoting clean Missouri who were against the ethics bills they\nBecause they knew that if they actually pass these ethics reforms at the house has passed a number of times it's always been stopped in the Senate if they pass these reforms it would be harder to deceive people to vote for amendment one\nGo so they want an amendment one they want an amendment one to be able to say we are the nights on the white horses got in fact ... is not required at all they could have done it and then it could be law today\nExplained to me Carl beard and how it is that um isn't there a law that says each amendment should only be one specific amendments and dealing with one specific subject and yet every single one of these has three or four different subjects in the right\nSo and this was challenged in Cole County court where all these things have to be challenged the circuit judge who study that spent the most time on it actually got it right and he threw him one off the ballot because it was multiple subject there is a constitutional provisions says you can't have multiple subjects\nThe western district court of appeals disagreed and they put it back on the ballot uh so what the western district court of appeals in the Supreme Court refused to hear\nWhat they've essentially done and said that single subject is meaningless a show with a legislature now has a has pretty much a free rein I think to say okay well we'll a couple of things up\nYou know and put things together and make it work\nSo someone's out there they're frustrated they don't see their state government working for them they see the cesspool down and Jefferson City they see the lobbyist owning the politicians um what can they do if this isn't the way to to fix that well\nThey they need to Bush particularly their senators to pass these ethics reforms because they are on the verge of doing it the house passes it every time and the house will pass very strong things it's usually stopped and set up so they need to make sure they're centered they need to actually pay attention you know to their elected representatives\nStop watching the TV stop watching the commercial stop listening\nTo the uh not necessarily all true word you hear a on on these commercials\nAnd start paying attention to what's going on and they can make a difference because I I Will tell you that when representatives get phone calls at ten phone calls on an issue they think their whole districts for or against it as a matter of getting engaged and getting involved because if you want better government you have to start with yourself yeah huh\nSo stopped farming out to other people and actually do do your do you do do ... and that's what we\nTry to do is you know from Missouri we try to give them a platform for doing that we try to keep them informed because we're all busy and but we try to keep them informed about what's going on and if you care about X Y Z issue that we're talking about getting engaged and we'll give you that opportunity to do that\nWhere are you on these three different medical marijuana bills will be voting so\nWe have three and we have two constitutional amendments and we have one proposition which is which means that go into law statutes the two constitutional amendments are extremely bad and the fact that\nThey put legislation they put regulation our constitution there is no reason and it should not go on a constitution should have gotten into statute what they should have done the amendments as say medical marijuana is legal in the state of Missouri and stop there\nAre they also all three of them have issues in regards to firearms or if you are applying to buy a firearm and you are a medical marijuana user under these programs you are on the list\nIf you go on to buy a firearm they're going to ask you specifically on that forum whether you use any drugs particularly marijuana\nAnd if you check yes you will not be able to buy that firearm if you don't check yesterday they find out that you do your subject a felony prosecutions\nShow the best one I Believe his proposition see that that legalized medical marijuana few or for that you'd want to vote proposition C because all three of these I guarantee you will have problems somewhere along the line in their implementation props he can be fixed right away by the legislature amendments two and three cannot be because it takes a vote of the people\nAre where are you on the vaunted and very controversial bingo fix\n'em you know that's a really a tough one but I think you ought to pass it\nOut and I are they going to go to another meal they accept\nPeople don't want to expand being about the run our expanding mango what this measure does is allow them to advertise if you're a nonprofit that's the only people can run bingo and the state of Missouri today for your non profit you can't advertise this would allow them to advertise that there's been a court issue on that sort of trying to fix that\nAnd then this would also allow uh people who belong to an organization to belong to that organization only six months instead of two years to be able to manage\nThe program so you're in favor of the ... are in far enough and then where are you on the gas\nTax acts as a is a big mess first off it has a problem where it was\nA single subject issue because it started out as only relieving the taxes on Olympian who earned gold or silver medals they wouldn't have to be a tax on it 'cause it's actually gold and silver ... oh okay and so on the last day they added this unrelated measure of the gas tax it got no vetting in a house they got no committee meetings\nAnd I and I think it's the wrong way to go so I don't think we ought to do for single subject but I also think there's still a lot of work we can do on funding that as as already prevalent are already presidents\nThat we could use before we start raising tax\nI don't understand that that's a perfect example if each one of these things have to be a single subject how do you get a taking away the Olympic Medals tax and the gas tax that's two completely different things\nRight so again this went to court and the judge said well you know the legislature we give them broad powers and because they're both taxes it's the same subject\nI don't understand that I shouldn't have been that way\nI don't understand anything about your your [laughter] your last all of our to understand that we all

tiara\nThanks Jim Dr Michael limb is with us cardiologist with access them how to hospital ... good morning so over the last couple of weeks and months we've seen a scooters\nAh get dropped off on the corner of the ride share throw your and throw what tap your phone on it and you're off and running on a bike on a bike sharing a bike scooter for every ... yang\nHospitals are now starting to see yeah scooter accidents coming into the hospital\nYes these scooters are actually get to be doing quite fast and are\nAre beautiful sidewalks and roads aren't necessarily the smooth is ... it's pretty easy to get out of control and so hospitals are actually starting to see\nA serious injuries from these uh and then the other conundrum is that ah when you're riding a bike or or similar type of thing you're supposed to wear a helmet and that sort of the modern day I Know you and I didn't do that right back and we're a kid we didn't ride home it right\nBut that theoretically now we should have learned better and we should be writing helmets but uh I think if you go around today or you you remember the last few days seeing folks riding these scooters there's no how much to be found and so\nI think that we do have to be cognizant of the union yang piece you know it's a little more convenient to be able to use your phone app to get on a scooter and it takes to someplace a little bit quicker but there's a safety concern to and you gotta make sure that you are looking out for yourself\nWell and just because you have the helmets it's doesn't that get into a false sense of security\nWell correct you to helmet does not prevent you from everything that happens whether you're on a biker scooter or whatever it is for your protection but are still trying to be careful you know so\nLosing control on this or how many hours have you spent writing an electric scooter to perfect\nOr your skills and balance and knowing how to\nLook out for people that come out on his unexpectedly around the corner a and then theoretically are also not supposed to ride them on the roads but then now when you take them on the roads that you're trying to dodge cars and trucks and and other things and so I think there's a lot of hazards and a lot of potential danger with these scooters\nYou know it's not just the scooters that ... the ride sharing scooters but you've also got the regular scooters\nUh and then you see these kids with these records and the the the I don't know what you call him the sort of skate boards the new the regular skate board the twenty first century skate boards and then the bicycles and I mean a use eyes you see kids all the time well doing all this stuff without helmets\nYou do and I think that's existed for forever and so I'm I'm not a proponent necessarily of uh the fact that you have to legislate safety and make a common sense a will usually when the day um\nA common sense a will usually when the day I'm you know we have to knock you're not going to a couple of times I think before you start sort of learning that why that might be a good thing for a while\nBut it also is I agree with you right we were we you know ... what are you talking about they didn't have so that was enough car seats when we were kids but you know what they're for the grace of God go any of us because there was a couple of us from our generation who aren't doing so well because they got it on the head the wrong way\nCorrect and winter's coming in you know I've been a big skier and it never used to ski with a helmet but now that's the way to do it and there have been some serious accidents so skiing you riding bike riding scooters skate boards all kinds of dying and one of the most beautiful changes I think from when you and I are kids as\nA they have skateboard parks now and so they they sort of have ways for these things to be out of the streets in out of the sidewalk I think those are that's a much better improvement a including the helmets and and the safety equipment\nI Will say this I started writing I don't know a couple of years ago and I rode um without a helmet on\nA summer I was like a helmet smell man you know how to ride a bike and I got to where I was going and there are three or four adults who kind of shame to me that they were like what are you an idiot and I was like really like what what are you where you're going to ride to the park in the street without a helmet go go get a helmet and so it was almost like a it was a herd mentality I was almost shamed into into wearing a helmet well\nGood for them or in a little ways because you know and we necessarily don't always make the best decisions for ourselves in it you know you're getting help from the people around us to make us realize oh I didn't think about that right I'm taking a chance that I probably shouldn't actually be taking\n... I Know exactly it was it was man it was like oh look stupid in that helmet\nRight and they were like shut up in ... so\nMy hope would be that we're not riding scooters bikes and whatever because we think we look\nGood right I Know all that but you know I'm as guilty as ...\nLike the getting out and doing things in the outdoors enjoying beautiful fall days I'm all for that I think we just need to be a little more self aware and are not take chances with her body we only have one of them so we should try to take care of it\nDr Michael ... is it true that if you would have one the one point four billion dollar lottery yesterday you still would have gone to work today\nThat's correct that is correct It's easy of course me to say since I did not win but that is correct I'd be doing the exact same thing to do that did yesterday\nThere was a rumor going around the you're the one of us who would still go to work the next day and you do what you love so we appreciate rumors choosing a cardiologist as as I said ... hospitals will get Dr Michael ... have a great day twenty six five fifty K.
