being nice when Kentucky\nI'm barely got by Sandy I guess\nFourteen of light or they scored the winning touchdown was about eight minutes remaining and again but that just goes to prove you already knew there was going to be difficult you know because the Wildcats will be ... the last three times but now when you're talking about Vanderbilt\nSomebody that Missouri is kind of old and you know

All right thank you are there knows well the news this week cp snow number twelve or so there you go All right do we have Molly hunter\nMolly hunter ABC News correspondent assemble turkey covering the I'm a bizarre story I'm Molly hunter or over the weekend it seems like Saudi Arabia has changed their story once again\nIraq in the morning I get my cat is that the third radically different plenty to what happened to Jamal ... twenty two and a half weeks ago\nFatty official originally sad you know it's a show he walked out on his on a on a kept our second and we are getting pretty quickly that probably true\nThat over the weekend they cut out a official government statement that said okay with a thick accent and he came in the fifth grade\nAnd that's how he died and I didn't even tricky for like six I use the word for all of which I think we can all agree that commonly commonly used and we stuck with a fatty official yesterday and this that you said actually it was not like\nHe came and he tried to reverse that physical altercation and see what else F ... fighter Eighteen guys spend attain credit card and not have the guy\nDo we know where the body is\nWay down and the guy that had the big question that is that everyone talking today about the same fatty fish that we suffered yesterday\nAnd told us another narrative that runs counter to the Turkish narrative at least I Am and they said if I was given to a local coffee trader and ... percent gay who gave it to cooperate and who is a local cooperate or whether they decided that\nWe have no idea where he can have a report that the body was brought up in Iraq\nThat the last three weeks Turkish officials had said ... he was brutally killed inside the conflict he ... his memory and that that wouldn't have than a body per se ... found the Turkish officials instantly through cold water on that\nYou know what a Molly hunter watch the endgame here what what is I mean the Saudis are trying to weasel out of what I mean right I mean what's the endgame here if if they come out and said yes she was murdered he was killed we did it a little what's right I mean what's the what's the plan here\nRight the game it's I think every from the states I think President Trump is going to have to decide if that if what if I Am saying that\nWhat the us is going to dinner and we have heard of ... from President Trump where the last couple of weeks is that we need to wait for the investigation into it kept the president's access to anything that the next ten days he said we need to wait and get the cat is a time\nAnd finally over the weekend she exercise or at least to voice a little bit of caution and is that a narrative that he called the Washington Post and said okay obviously they spend a lot of conception there for life\nBut he's not the point the finger at content on at the time I became\nBehind somebody like that guy that President chocolate shake his foreign policy in the middle East that Saudi Arabia what his first day that his son in law\nHad maintained when built in very close relationship which cuts shuttered said nobody's talking is responsible and nobody has told me he is not responsible I read if he wasn't response about which ...\nAt least for shadow was like the U.S may not do if in fact is that is cannot and say we have\nYou know brutally killed this man and had broken international norms\nWe have you know brutally killed this man and had broken international norms and I think a lot of people in the United states Republicans and Democrats have on their satisfaction with interest on that far\nWhen when last we left this melodrama there were investigations going on where where are we in these in the investigations\nWhite so terribly there to investigations going on there for Turkish patient with sharing a sample I see the the Turks go into the conflict into that conflict rabbits for rent here come out with boxes\nAnd we have seen that ongoing noticed that it had said that writing an investigation as well they even handed it running and joined today that's the case yesterday the foreign minister said is is that we work with are\nTurkish colleagues but there's no evidence of that the only thing I Know that the investigation that apparently and according to secretary of state on how\nBad it is and why and they said it would be thorough and timely and President Trump that that that's not it and so I'm On the crime print personally promised that they would also complete investigation design out that the fat investigation\nShare the story of this morning or the Saudis tried a body doubles have you heard this story this morning\nThat the story going around ABC cannot confirm it seems that the CNN Turkish channel after finding this report leaks by Turkish officials shows that ... show these clothing\nWalking out of the conflict and then that surrounds it continues to share this guy what am I hearing assemble which is one of the biggest threat they showed his hair at a restaurant and then finally said just setting up the clothing and we have not confirmed that they not edited surveillance video is real\nConclusions from it if it's true is that it's going to be really hard for the fat is to say that this wasn't premeditated if they rarely brought a guy with a job with the the body\nIt's going to mean another possible explanation but right now we're going to the Turks after that's more refined fatty questions about\nMolly hunter you're the best be safe in assembled turkey thanks good to talk\nTo you than six twenty seven that's the best

I don't know what exactly happened but\nIt is not uncommon for those injuries to happen at the same time if it's a you know a lot of times it's you know they're both they can both happened at the same time um so that that's not that rare but it does suggest it was\nIt was not you know a subtle tweak it was a you know a bad one um it's it's really cool because just the day before\n... who had its tip off of there where after the football game they had a you know folks go over to the basketball arena dumped contact and did a little scrimmage just to give folks kind of a teamster of so many players things like that and Dante we really\nLook good I'm to the point that you know he at one point jumped up and threw down to put back dark that we've never really seen him get up like that before and he was asked about it\nAfter that scrimmage and he said that you know he deals with you know need ten tonight at sea have had some he has always had you know sore knee you've asked about\nUm you know his family has a you know a long history of of the problems is from starting with his his dad who who you know as you can tell as he walks around the court he's got you know he's got problems with with Disney is er\nWhich aren't they using this as a positive way he was saying I feel great you know my knees are behaving I feel like I can jump and fly in and do the things that I've always wanted to do but haven't always been able to show it can be\nAnd then the next day this happens just the cruel thing for him to have to talk about you know how good he feels in that area and then the next day you know one bad move and all of a sudden you're season's over\nSo last week you were on the show and then you went and it gives them a news conference a with Moe and everybody was all a foreigner over what most said did he say anything about Bryce Harper or allude to Bryce Harper ... in any way shape or form\nYou can't I mean you gotta you can't you can't say a into free agency officially begins you can't talk about a guy I mean you'd ... you'd face you know ... punishment in front of the league right he did\nSay you know he said they need the hitter he said that that's just the top of their shopping list um he did talk a lot about you know\nHe his decisions are going to look for off in ... and you know there's only so many positions to upgrade um at least ... that makes sense on paper right now that could change and he talked about kind of the need for for someone who stabilize the middle of the line up he also said that look you know\nSome of the decisions that we make might not be the popular ones um so I think he's trying to acknowledge that they need in office of booze she's also trying to think\nFanned the flames a little bit that it's hard for a bus this off season because that's not ever have the cardinals operates so she did not he did not throw gas on the fire but he did say we need someone who's going to be kind of a middle of the order presence on the line up because we once\nAgain lacks that he did throw a little shade on those you know what that shoulder injury\nA little I'm no more than that yeah basically I think is to get it got tired of being asked why the cardinals didn't get it was you know shoulder right any I mean he's very adamant about pointing out it's a two way street when it comes to that\nI think they felt like march so\nFor whatever reasons was you know kind of stubborn when I came to getting treatment and that's going to be a big theme of the off season those guys being diligent getting a write in coming into spring training ready to go not coming into spring training ready to find out what's wrong\nUm you know and it makes every ... since ... to\nTo do that this off season I mean he is entering a contract year he's not just playing for the cardinals the season is playing for every other team that might want to sign him\nSo you know he he made a commitment to the team to be ready to go um they told them they will help him in whatever way they can no matter where he is this off season he just has to follow through with that you're supposed to eat meat with his doctor\nAround the end of the month and and they're going to decide what exactly is the plan is I guess there is still you know some sort of a chance that could be some sort of operation but it did not sound like that um at least at the press conference so it sounds like it's going to come down to rehab and you know physical therapy which if he's not diligent and like I don't know how he could expect much different\nResults next season and then lastly Ben ... today dot com singles posed this dispatch a columnist sports groups do you agree with me or for you wrong headed when it comes to\nUm the bullpen use right the brewers are great bullpen was it just burned out and abused and exhausted so over used that that that they couldn't overcome the Dodgers\nSoil I mean they didn't have any other options ... I mean they if they had that they had a bunch of good starters I think they would have been a more traditional style the ... the bird we all season that's been there starting rotation\nSo they they tried to find a way to to work around that and the way to work around that is to lean heavily on an elite bullpen that only got better as the seasons are more alarming that's risky anytime you're doing it but the more and more teams are doing it\nToward the toward the post season when every game matters so much so if they were sitting or pulling really good starters all the time to do it I Would say yeah I don't know five ... if I'm by that if they're pulling Clinton Kurdish off the mountain to weddings that I'm maybe I'm not the greatest idea but they don't have that guy\nThat one good start or one of their other starters dealing with down um you know so so he had the ankle injury so they even lost one of them and he was just okay so\nThey really didn't have any other option I I think what they were trying to do and I understood it was they were just trying to pitch their best pitchers as much as possible and then their case their best pitchers were relievers so\nInevitably you know it didn't it didn't work out but they got further than most teams\nOr who were some of the states there are above the Missouri [noise]\nWell I think notably is a state that went on about Missouri state of Tennessee and for a long time we have compared herself to\nTennessee as one of the faith that does tax all the right and this is the year and we actually moved past them and you look at other states that do it pretty well and you're looking at states like Oklahoma you're looking at states like Florida generally speaking they fight taxes\nBut I think Missouri has been a pretty good spot I don't think that we're quite a low tech state yet I think we still have a long way to go particularly on the sales tax and with the fact\nThat is less a question or or you know direct problem upstate all the more problem of local uh taxing district and local policies that kind of stack up sales taxes overtime [noise]\nUm but I think by and large where you're looking at is a pretty good taxing environment for the state I think there's you know work to be done as there always will be but I think that we're having the right direction and and you know fortunately after this you know this past year were ahead of Tennessee So that something could be very optimistic about\nYeah you know you mentioned Texas or Florida or you can't drive to the gas station without having some type of a toll road on your car so right they got a bunch of toll roads the easy pass\nSo we don't have that here so we we we tax or roads right this prop ... is going to be a a sales tax or a gas tax so you know it's not always apples to apples when you compare state like Florida having a low sales tax\nAnd and no state income tax as opposed to Missouri [noise]\nYeah I you know you you end up having to weigh those uh you know costs and benefits of having toll roads are having higher gas taxes or instead if you want to provide funding for those\nThat infrastructure or whether you're going to do it through like just a general income tax we long talked about how important to to make sure that if you're using the road that you should probably be the one that pays for it first and foremost the best way to do that\nIs through gas taxes answered going in your exactly right you really don't see towing here in the state of Missouri media at all I Can't think of a place off hand where we actually do that here\nBut they do it in Kansas they do it all across North if they do it you know in lock places across country an antique that you're trying to mitigate the tax burden on everybody and and try to concentrate that caught people who are using it I think that you know polling is an option but if you're not going to be telling like gas taxes and the next best option\nYeah Patrick go more on the website about this stuff yeah gosh I mean that trick is my I have a good day Patrick thanks for taking it very too big five fifty a K tiara let me\nTell you about speaking of vehicles Johnny loaned up Chevrolet highway two Seventy or the Washington those are the ...

the corner saying ah you know please I'm I'm I'm homeless give me five dollars or\nThe overwhelming majority of those people\nAre going to take that money and to give it to the drug dealer so my argument was or is if you really want to help the homeless\nGive money to St Patrick's center do you know who says that\nSt Patrick's center the people who run the homeless the right the people who are our job it is is to run the programs to help the homeless get back up onto their feet if you give money to a homeless person you are not solving the problem you might be making yourself feel better\nRight they are it's it's safer\nTo grab whatever we can put it on our back and walk north then to stay where we are I have no idea\nTo do with these people [noise] um I I don't know what the laws say we should do to these people right uh what is it what is the true definition of a political um asylum what is the the definition of somebody right I I don't I don't know I have no idea\n[noise] um\nI Do know that I Do know that we do have a statue of liberty that says give us your poor your tired your hungry yearning to breathe free I Do know I Do know that sort of one of the tenets of our country I don't know where these people who are tired hungry and broke and I'm sure there are ... for a better life I don't [laughter]\nI'm sure [laughter] I think those people\nAre we have always in the past been open to refugees right people seeking political asylum people who are afraid for their life right so I don't know where the whole thing goes in there but there's something

of me you do to me isn't that isn't that a passage in the in that in Matthew somewhere\nAnd so as we try and figure out as a country what to do with these five thousand seven thousand people who are taking whatever they have on their backs and walking up to Mexico and they don't know where they're going but they know they're getting out of\nHarm's way that what you do\nTo the least of my brothers you do to me isn't that what Jesus said at some point\nRight and so isn't what we do to these people\nWhat we do to Jesus\nAnd I see a lotta people praising Jesus around here and around the country and for years right praise Jesus\nAnd so if these are the poorest among us\nIf these people\nTired poor and hungry you're earning to breathe free that would get on\nTheir shoes whatever type of shoes they have but whatever they have in a nap stack and start walking north\nUm that's the least among us and so as a society as a person who is\nLiving on the earth in the richest country in the
