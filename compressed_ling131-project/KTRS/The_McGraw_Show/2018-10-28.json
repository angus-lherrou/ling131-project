[noise]\nWanting everybody happy Sunday to you thank you very much for joining us on the big five fifty Katie arrest or we're having a senior moment\nShow that's out there that here for you\nThat's just a great source of information if you're planning on receiving care if you're receiving or even if you or that person delivering care to your loved one because again to comfort care we want people to live their best life possible you know in the past we've talked about\nHow we're sort of like the family that there when the family can't be there\nBut it's more than just family you know we try to be a resource for all of our clients all of their loved ones their neighbors even because nobody lives in this world alone everybody\nBecause nobody lives in this world alone everybody has a series of orbits to help support them a series of people and resources and things that they need whether it's\nThose folks who work on their financials those folks who work as part of their clergy support or their medical support or their family or their caregivers and then sometimes what happens\nIs that family becomes caregiver and then they become family caregiver and then they lose that family identity and we see that so very often as a matter of fact over the past several weeks we've been helping a family um actually it's just a husband and wife\nAnd my husband has been in the hospital for quite some time he had to have a procedure done uh I guess it was oh my gosh what was she telling me about seven months ago he had a procedure done in a hospital and I remember folks you don't want to go into the hospital\nAnd something went wrong so he's been in a hospital or in\nA rehab community ever since early March\nI don't know about you but I wouldn't want to do that\nThere's a lot of things that can go on number one there's loneliness there's depression there's all kinds of things but on top of it you end up\nLosing a lot of the muscle tone you lose a lot of the things that you can do so they asked us to come in and to provide the wife with some time where she can go off and do things that she needed to do for herself\nBut in the meantime she wanted to make sure that the husband was doing things to get better\nSo we go into the hospital were there with the client I won't call them a patient because even though he's a patient and hospital he's not our patient he's our client\nBut we make sure that he does his exercise let me tell you something he doesn't want to do with exercise is he's just happy if we're sitting there making sure that he's getting skin care that he's that we're helping to make sure that\nShe doesn't end up with beds source and things like that but you know what\nThat's not necessarily what is best for him\nHe can make a decision and say I don't want anybody here that some time but he hasn't done that yet because he knows when we're there we're going to make sure to the best of our absolute ability that he does his exercises and he does the things that therapy has said he needs to do\nAnd again that's something that we really do enjoy\nAnd we enjoy doing that because number one it gives us an opportunity to again help that family feel safe and we'll leave that everything is going okay but it also gives us an opportunity to be around other caregivers and just kind of help everybody understand that you know we have a culture where we want to help people\nUm earlier this morning you heard me talking a little bit how this hasn't been the greatest of weeks for us but you know what every day that we wake up and every day that we're able to help somebody is another day that we get the fulfillment out of doing what we do\nSo before we went to break we were talking I was talking with you guys a little bit about helping everybody understand a little bit more about our process so we have a very very special guest in this morning I'm somebody who really is you know part of the backbone part of the\nWay that we're able to keep calm for here in our families and our caregivers happy so we have our office\nManager our primary scheduler um I'll call her are Jill of all trades a Adrian who is in the studio with us this morning say good morning Adrian good morning everybody know you're supposed to say good morning Adrian come on you know man [laughter]\nAnd Adrian has been with us it come for comfort care for quite some time now um I should have looked it up before coming in here it's so over five years it's over five years and a comfort care actually as a nation wide organization\nI'm you know my business covers all of St Louis area on the Missouri side um\nBut uh you know it's it's been in business for quite some time this particular location is going on almost ten years now oh my gosh I Can't believe how time flies when you're having fun and a Adrian started\nOut with us as a caregiver working with some of our um most affected clients those especially with MS and helped us to really develop kind of an overarching kind of way to help those folks so I'm so welcome to comfort care welcome to the studio this morning\nThank you and I wanted to bring Adrian in a little bit because a lot of people you know when we get the call they ask okay so how does this all work and I'll just kind of start kick this off and I'll let you talk a little bit more about it but generally it starts with the folks calling us\nTo take advantage of that free no risk no obligation I sit for yes no cost a safety risk assessment in your home you know you might be dealing with somebody a loved one whether it's a mother a father and a half to or even years\nYou might be dealing with somebody a loved one whether it's a mother a father and a half to or even your spouse\nWho isn't able to do all those things that they are they really shouldn't be doing if they're going to live independently um I think we call them ... activities of daily living and those are things like bathing and grooming interesting you know transferring from bad to a chair from chair to bed I'm as well as eating by themselves\nAnd bomb Adrian you worked specifically\nWith some people with MS um what are some of the challenges that people who have a little bit more advanced form of of that particular a challenge have with you know managing the eighty else and and doing those videos\nWell in some cases um the people could be bed bound I'm\nStill not they're not bound in their bed that out in their ... and I'll say stuck\nSo they have a little bit more challenge then some of our clients that are able to use walkers are don't need any assistance in walking so that sets up but in a different case of challenges for the caregivers\nSo we always have our nurse with ... first start out with a new client we have our nurse go in and do an assessment so that our caregivers are prepared to meet meet these clients needs and what we do is we develop a care plan\nSo that when our caregivers go in\nThere are aware of what the special needs are if this person needs to be transferred\nUm if they need a whole year left\nA wet lift a whole year left what is that\nIt is a mechanical a mechanical device that will help lift a person from a bad or chair to a wheelchair\nOkay so in other words it's it's basically allowing one person for the most part to help somebody else who and I'm going to turn of phrase here not the greatest afraid says but afraid somebody who is potentially dead weight getting them up out of their bed without injuring everybody involved\nOkay and that's that's generally the kind of piece of equipment that a lot of people in hospitals or nursing oh excuse me skilled nursing facilities or that they see them all the time and we train our folks on that kind of stuff don't weigh\nCorrect we have um several lead caregivers that um\nAre um higher level caregivers that have more um have gone through training that\nThey are more skilled in certain areas and then they take that knowledge and helped train caregivers that don't have that knowledge so we utilize um their education and they assist us with um training in certain areas\nSo so basically when we're putting somebody who has not been with a particular client in an assignment we want to make sure that that new caregiver knows the client knows the process was after that client and actually has\nSeen somebody who is more experienced with that client do the things that that client needs for help\nCorrect and so you know we call that shadow training folks\nBut other people call it on the job training some agencies do it I Believe in investing a lot of money and doing that so that everybody is safe you know we don't want somebody lifting somebody in an unsafe way because that's not good for anybody involved\nAnd depending on the clients needs and I'm Down a level of care that this person needs will determine how much on job training that they can't get a new caregiver going into a ... a client will need\nAnd we've got some pretty particular clients yes we [laughter] and and and I mean there are some clients where we actually make sure that newer caregivers get two days worth of training with another caregiver and more experience somebody who's been there before\nRight correct and we don't ask the client pay for that do we know we did not charge declined for training so so let's back up a little bit and talk about the process we started out by talking about\nThe no risk safety assessments to help them avoid slips trips and falls and then setting up an nurses assessment right right\nFirst thing is to get a nurse assessments so we know exactly where our client is as far as health and um wellbeing and then to determine what kind of care they're going to need\nAnd then the next step would be to determine how much service they're going to need whether they need one day a week if they need three times a week four hours a day um\nAre the ones that we really love those twenty four seven clients right definitely those twenty four seven ... and that actually is your principal responsibility of the company right right is a developing determining and coordinating schedules between the clients their families and our caregivers right\nAnd then going from there and then trying to match up the best care giver to the clients needs and personality\nYou know you brought up a really really great subject to most talked about it in a minute but first we need to take a break real quick here on we're having a senior moment and thanks again for joining us every body and on Sunday Morning I'm

[noise]\nCome back every body and thanks again for joining us this morning this beautiful Sunday Morning on we're having a senior moment [noise] getting a little chilly we know that and so it's always a little bit tougher to get yourself up in the morning and get out and start moving around but\nThat's why in this segment we're going to have\nOur medical moment with Dr Chris ... of the gear health and wellness center say good morning\nGood morning and it's always a pleasure to have you here um and again just so that people who aren't always with us every Sunday Morning tell everybody who you are where you're at what you do and how they can get in touch with you before we even get started\nSure thing well ah my name is Dr ... Proctor and functional nutritionist so we help people with um spine related issues as well as how to get help from the inside out [noise] so um\nYeah today I wanted to talk about exercise not just um for your muscles but um how can impact your brain and it does it does use it or lose it absolutely applies to both\nThe Moscow skeletal system it's hard to say as well as your brain I mean we see it all the time so tell everybody what it is that uh is new and information that they can use insurance\nWe talked a couple of weeks ago about the importance of keeping mitochondria healthy in your brain ha ha ha ha I'm so mitochondria are those power plants for energy and everything was okay and uh there's new research tongue in mitochondria helps with anti aging\nSo um do that exercise can increase the number of mitochondria in your brain as well I did not know that but now I Do that's called mitochondrial biogenesis it makes sense if you consider all the muscles are tied to a nerve fibers in your brain okay make that connection\nBut understanding that regular exercise increases a new brain mitochondria is a game changer for a lot of people\nAnd our research is also showing that the body produces and tore as well as anti cancer chemicals are wary exercise and so what you're saying is that ... regular exercise not just brain stimulation type of exercise\nHelps your brain work as well yeah physically exercising has its impact on the mitochondria so that's incredible ... so go on you were going to talk a little bit more about this [laughter] yeah well just the concept of losing muscle mass and strength as we age is called ...\nAnd uh this increases the risk of falling getting fractures and essentially losing our independence which is obviously a significant ordeal especially to us\nAnd yeah yeah and uh I don't think that's a new information but I Do want to emphasize that we need protein to build muscle you know it's about a little less than a gram for every ... kilogram that a way is the recommended or ...\nAnd um but just as important as eating in a protein we have to be able to digest it so digestive enzymes are very popular and this is just another good reason to consider them in your diet so digestive\nEnzymes are we talking things like probiotics and all of that oral addicts\nAre great it's not necessarily a digestive enzyme that just depends on just help you break down a proteins breakdown fats breakdown carbs whenever eating them so ones for protein specifically\nUm I mentioned a couple of weeks ago how we produce less and less stomach acid as as we age now that stomach has it helped to break down a protein molecules okay so if we have left stomach acid we are getting worse and worse at digesting so we so we\nMay be taking in the appropriate amount we are just not using the appropriate amount\nYeah exactly okay if you can't break it down and you can't use it to repair tissues and potentially wasted food that's\nWasted food so what you're saying you know if we can kind of draw the bottom line here on this is make sure you get enough protein and make sure you get enough exercise to utilize that protein because that's also going to keep your brain from\nGoing into a you know I hate to use the term atrophy but you that's going to help you prevent losing brain processing power\nYeah absolutely another one of the thing I just wanted to touch bond with growth hormone okay that's a hormone um it's very important for tissue repair and we boost that naturally when we exercise or as well as when we sleep\nOkay so so sleep helps that whole process\nYes asleep is when we're going to the relief sought it as growth hormone okay and um so the exercising you're going to stimulate your mitochondria and try to exercise you're also going to boost as a growth hormone okay and that can help you\nSort of my other so that so these mitochondria that are there in your brain\nYou regenerate them read us reactivate there\nWill you both um as we age we tend to lose that capacity who we talked about atrophied\nSo um as we age we tend to lose that capacity we talked about atrophied so let's do what we can to now read generate that okay and um so yeah that's what I talked about earlier the mitochondrial biogenesis okay rebuilding right then ...\nWhat I wanted to make sure that I heard that the folks out there also heard is that you know you may not have had it to begin with or you may have lost some of it but you have the opportunity to rebuild it by bringing in again enough protein and making sure that\nYou keep your digestive enzymes and inappropriate level yeah now clearly that's great information so if people want to get hold of you to hear more about that or to find out about more of your services Chris how do they how do they get in touch with you\nOr they can call us our office directly at three one four six eight one two eight zero zero or even visit our website at a doctor to gear dot com D.

ten during their first break out to the market update to wrap up\nAnd the thought for the day so I'm with you stay a week and I tell you what the delta where they're seven days a week because they get too much going on\nTo that stay on top of the investment markets to help you feel more comfortable with your money and say this is we always start out the ... always talk about the weekly review that let me share this before we go into the actual numbers\nOver the last couple of months I've been sharing with my thoughts and that's all they are no buddy has any idea what the market you're going to do but I mentioned many many times almost every program so I felt the market was going to get more and more volatile going into the election folks we have\nMore trading days before\nNovember six six more trading day Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and friday this week Mondays and next week and then that Tuesday a week from this Tuesday it's election day regardless of what your problems are concerns are\nIf you don't vote that you don't have anything to say please go out and vote\nVote for whom you think is best for America but hold please vote\nOn what's happening with this volatility nobody knew what was going on I thought something big was going to happen I still think things can happen between now and election but can you imagine that terrible horrific things that have happened this week pike by\nKilling and the Senate guy a I mean it goes on and on and on I mean it's shaking in markets all over the place but our economy in my opinion continues to stay strong\nPeople have jobs people are making money people are spending money people are buying things companies are making money that the key for me to feel comfortable\nWith being in the market if you have a well defined balance investment portfolio now again we've talked about this some of the folks that were in five or six stocks last year\nFive or six different investments [noise] some of them did extremely well they were just in a very few so they weren't diversified now this year\nAgain they may have made a lot of money one time and now it down and it's up it's all around but we still feel at dealt investment services company ah I still feel\nThat the well defined balanced portfolio not having all your money in the stock market not having all your money and CDs\nThat had to go all your money in stocks are buying our preservation of principle type programs but being diversify having money in certain areas where yeah you probably won't make too much\nBut you can't lose that your CD your money market account you gotta have money people tell me I don't want to have any money at the bank you've got to have money in my opinion [noise] some of your money in the bank now you know everybody here we can't tell you you have to do this you have to do that because everybody\nYou know everybody here but we can't tell you you have to do this you have to do that because everybody is different but we have to have a certain amount of our money in my opinion is guaranteed\nThat we can do that at the bank and then we have a certain investments they give us what we call preservation of principle benefit to stay on those programs would follow the guidelines then we can't lose any money but those investments are only back by let's say the insurance companies each other or the company's backing those products\nAnd how good are those well they may be really good that they're not good as good as he FDIC had been so much money in stocks in so much money in ... and so much money and alternative investments so much money maybe in coins like we're going to be talking to ...\nLike a well defined balanced portfolio not everything making money maybe something's flat maybe some things making money may be some things down just slightly but a well defined balanced portfolio that to me is the key to long term success\nAnd what are the thing before we get in the numbers I mentioned to you a couple of months ago that I Would let you know if we at delta we're\nGonna move out of the market before the election\nBut what happened this month and again this is a off much\nI don't know how this month could be a month with six days left it could be you know by its head off much\nAnd we're back with lower bunny talking about are castle with money talk I've been hosting money talked for over Thirty years now here in St Louis every Sunday Morning for Thirty years\nAnd I just want to thank you so much for being with me I it doesn't matter whether you're a first time or money talk or you've been listening for many many years and so as so many of you have\nIt's a pleasure being able to share our views with you\nAnd help you maybe feel a little bit more comfortable with your money and somebody who's been with us for many many years as clay tea and somebody who's been with us for a long long time as Scott those Corey and clay welcome back in money dark how are you today have\nThings or rural and Bob how things on their money talk land\nIt's always it's always busy and I know you're busy because you've got an upcoming event you like to share this morning with all of our money chocolate search\nAbsolutely matter of fact what's going on is that it's our second option here which is something really big in St Louis because what happens is that not only is this coins shovel watch really high quality stuff in that category as it always is\nPlus this time we have jewelry and watches it all kinds of futile states that category so it it's going to be a big auction it's gotta be November second it starts at six o'clock in the St Charles convention center and um there's live video catalog choice I have time to stop a store and get a catalog so it's a quite a big deal going off\nAnd I think it's open to the general public on what November second and third so what happened the first one of the first\nSecond third there was a big coin show at the same place at the St Charles convention center there is a St Louis rare coin expo silver dollar ... and it starts on the uh\nFirst of November and that's of course on Thursday and friday rushing tend to ... and then the third which runs from tend to foreign and also it's free and free parking like always so it's a real good situation for a\nWhile [laughter] I don't know I Know that we always have a lot of money talkers or that are there is there anything the city that kind of stands\nOut there in your mind clay that you'd think this might be something that the money talkers might be interested in\nWe always these options you better coin you get your three legged buffalo those that are for the buffalo Nichols series everyone should always knows about you 'cause you're real high rate Nineteen or nine or ...\nYou get your coins that actually you don't see very often in a coin shore because they're bitcoins and these are ones that actually sometimes people travel ... miles for\nAnd you get your better gold in there you get your goal to log in Charlotte different message you rarely see so there's all kinds of stuff for everybody had a tough spot in our collection\n[laughter] you know we've got the holidays coming up I'm I'm changing gears on yeah OK talked about it last month but here we are now were less than sixty days were about sixty days away\nFrom the Christmas holidays and the other holidays that occur in December and I mean you've got so many nice things\nThat are in my opinion a almost available for everybody ah your silver rounds your silver coins with all the beautiful and grading on can share with our money talkers a little bit about that\nSure you know is something that you and your wife really like a whole lot the silver while that come out every year for the holidays are ones that are saved and everyone used from your ear decorate the tree\nEvery year for the holidays are ones that are saved and everyone uses from your ear decorate the tree and trim the tree and stuff makes it look really really pretty are a lot of people have done this for years there one silver Morales\nThey have different designs on there like Santa maybe on a sleigh or you know short of a beautiful landscape of the snow ... with the church or something that actually might fit everybody's kind of home and start to add to it of course we always have a beautiful silver eagles for the year\nOf course being two thousand Eighteen we have the holders they have a nice little holiday wishes on so we have that as well and then of course if you wanna grow bigger we always have a full line of jewelry\nWe also have the silver proof says a regular process so there's a lot to pick from a lot to offer people so they can find something for that hard to buy person in our store\nAnd you know clearly when the thing that I think is so great\nAbout um you know the holidays and Scott was coined\nThat folks can come in and they don't have to worry well I don't have a hundred dollars I don't have fifty dollars I've got twenty five bucks you can actually buying silver around with a beautiful like you said snows setting or Santa Claus czar\nOr whatever on it for less than twenty five dollars\nThat is exactly right too 'cause basically we have spot value right now at about fourteen dollars and sixty cents\nAnd then what you do is you add a little premium to that because of these things are made with a nice gift box of capital 'cause they break him or an arm and holder to your choice you can pick either one so it'll cost you around twenty three dollars and sixty cents and that you're told the fee for is beautiful while so around they'll be treasured in your corner that box forever\nAnd ah as you know you know clay and many of our money tigers who lives in the years I we Janet I purchased those for all of the grandkids all the kids\nEvery year and what fun is when you're putting up the tree and you're starting to put the arguments on and you come across\nA silver

people tend to not realize too is\nWhen you have your auto insurance the insurance on your car that you pay for it covers it follows the car and it covers the car not necessarily you know I'm not saying that that you wouldn't be covered in some instances but for instance if you had a friend part your car you didn't have insurance brings a rigid have insurance\nAnd got into an accident it is your policy that would be the ... the first policy to cover it so you know if your friends driving your car whether or not he or is there is not a sure he gets in Iraq that's a claim against your ... years and always come and play and the same thing if you're driving someone else's car\nWhether or not you have insurance or not um the car itself whoever has been turned on the part though is always the first policy that come into play however oh you have to be driving someone's caution was not at not have insurance which helped you wouldn't be too that\nUm if if there is no interest in the car and then you personally your insurance could come into play for your auto insurance so you're you're covered\nIf you if you have an ... you're going to be covered both ways so people don't realize that's not the first insurance policies pay that the person who owns the car that policy is going to pay first and that can use the speed limit and especially when you signed up to maybe your insurance card getting us into it they're just kind of bad about it\nAnd you're thinking oh I Want to I'll I'll have my insurance pay for it that's not the way it works they will go to the ah\nCar owners policy first convince them if there's anything that that doesn't cover they made with two years so people don't realize the nuance of that and that can be a little unsettling ain't disrupt prefer ...\n... what about um we've heard that um you know young people\nPay more for their automobile insurance and maybe the people who are married or older that type of thing what about women uh ... what did you find it by a cause for women compared to men\nAre our survey came out and said that sixty percent of people did not realize that women in general pay less for car insurance than men and a lot of people were surprised that that that seems discriminatory what happened to do that well the reality is\nEach state's um governs the laws of of insurance so each state can mandate how a auto insurance can come up with your premiums\nThey can look at a variety of factors in each state's different so some things like credit report some some states can't use that to come up with your if you have bad credit they can charge you more other states they know the one thing all the things happen in general they all typically um we'll all\nThese charge more for your age in sort of makes sense you know you're older drivers driver\nYou make the impaired your older less experience you're younger but the the male female thing really kind of wrap it doesn't sound very fair for the insurance companies say well here's the deal we have all these studies and all this all these high and being the same then to to be more reckless they're more in touch with\nYou know ... ... are more likely to get into an accident than a female drivers so fair or we're going to charge them more and almost all states say that's okay so if I was like an ... quite a rule that you are going to pay less in general if you're a female to male\nSo when you're looking at all of these let's say ... that people think it's one thing that might be something else what advice do you have for money chocolate shares who who may not know the difference between what's truth him what's admit you know like we are talking about\nFake news all the time and things like\nIt really comes down to being informed and\nYou've got to be informed or your policies and what they cover and not do insurance sometimes it's not that will starting a topic that part of my job is to make it interesting and can super friendly and and make you want to do you really understand what's going up just being informed can can save you a lot of money in the fact that\nYou may have the wrong kind of insurance and it can also save your money when you find out\nThat you don't have a something that's covered so being a foreign just so important and it it it can be a matter of your pocket book too so I don't want to ever think that this is you know users savings that you can have one way or the other but also when it comes to health care that's even a bigger issue um that's important that's really important stuff that you're talking about what's going to be covered\nFor any kind of a sudden this that may arise or an accident\nSo I said the uniform that I really try to stress that and we really try to one of these things out but the key is to know your policy and be ready for it it whenever they come your way\nAnd it's just going to take a lot of you know talk to your agent shop around if you if your

Rosenbaum\nAffectionately known is doing which my wife does not like to comment by John ... he loves the ... John calling us from Susie who's with us today than it was not like call me that\nI don't really like calling you anything right now all belong I'm In the doghouse walk up to the program a beautiful Sunday Morning a little bit chilly but you know falls here leaves the fall and whether or not and whether began\nTalking to the environment okay for those of you that that a journalist in the program this is a a show about mortgages and financial affairs and more things related to our pocketbooks but you got to remember something okay and this is something that Robin I\nWere talking about before we we started the show is that money is there for quality of life\nMoney is not there so you can produce more money and\nWe we got into a discussion Robin I about the issue of well how come very wealthy people often when they have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank going strive to make more money more money and you know there's an element there of unhappiness very often was wealthy families we hear about all the time\nI'm sure there are lots of all the families that are happy as well you can't I don't know why even our heads so this\nCongress lousy name up because we are talking about the lottery and someone who won one point six billion dollars in South Carolina and so we were talking about how he's going to you know you take the lump sum it's nine hundred million dollars can literally sick and do anything he wants but he could put away a hundred of that money for the rest of his life and don't make millions off of just interest\nAnd so we were talking about was just the fact that there are people who are worth that much money and to them it's just a score it's like it doesn't even if it's trying to do is make more and more money when they could sit and\nDonate they could create chair they could do anything they want which they do but they also do that Dr\n... there's actually a show\nOn one of the charter channels how the lottery destroyed my family or something like oh yeah I have and to think about the fact\nThat there was an actual weekly show where they have one person after another person after another person telling their story about how money destroyed their lives that have been ... that it's just\nKnow you got to remember folks and when we talk about refinancing I'm paying off that and other kinds of things and yes this is a mortgage show so we're going to throw that in there that the concept here is for quality of life I had a customer\nThat the concept here is for quality of\nLife I had a customer or six months ago they have had a tremendous amount of debt\nThey have a mortgage they have a mortgage ... had a mortgage at three percent on the thirty year effects so they owed about a hundred and fifty thousand on their mortgage they're Seventy five thousand dollars in credit card that harrowing month\nThey're under stress and pressure okay trying to make their payments and they refused six months ago to consolidated that improve their ... their cash flow which would give them a better quality of life\nThat killing each other they're fighting they can't make ends meet their credit is is going down the tubes and they just didn't want to get rid of the three percent yeah okay\nThink what why why don't you know when you get money from his mother\nWith is okay and then he asks me and he says can I go ahead and if I Can't take the cash out can I buy a house in my mom's name since I have a general power of attorney\nYeah so she owns a house but she's not living in it because there's been a nurse she's a nurse and okay so that's got it\nSo I you know I kept explains the guy I said you why can't you do it in your name he says what my credit's terrible and the only way to put out a down payment and now [noise] so you're using mom's house give a general power of attorney which by the way we require a specific\nPower of attorney or power attorney that is specific to the transaction that says yeah mom is going ahead and giving power attorney to son to buy this particular home or refinanced this\nBlazer who has been and kiss you can't do that I Know that that's why that's my point is power of attorney general power return so I'm saying to myself something doesn't yeah do you get that impression yeah he\nYeah and the moment anybody would tell me like hey I Want to buy a house in her name like that just ... there's no upside he wants\nTo he wants to cash 'em in the house to buy another house she wants to do both loans\nAnd I was ... like I think you have to take out he spoke the oh I Can't get an opinion on what he said it without hearing his intention in his life\nBecause if he was just asking because it really does have an engineer and he does have power of attorney and was just asking if he could buy a home in her name hits hits credit let's wherever he could be a loving than he could be just meeting to help and that's and that's why his client to ask you\nYou'd have to know and ... you wouldn't know unless he spoke to him unless I stopped\nI thank God I got the impression I got a very very uncomfortable and let me put him in a different number to call\nI did [laughter]\nHow he took it I did I had the same situation where I think we talked about it and there was a guy that came into my office\nOkay and they were not saying that this matters anything because it doesn't but they were each of different ethnic persuasion doesn't matter in today's world\nBut they came in and he was Seventy years old and she was twenty five\nAnd he wanted to do a reverse mortgage on his house and give her the cash for business yet\nAnd he called me came in I said okay I'm a little suspicious if there's some influence here yeah they said okay I'll I'll do it for you then when we got started he calls me and says she scanning me I don't want to do this\nAnd so I Can't for the whole thing\nThey can any causing back three hours they're not on our we worked everything out I'm giving cash\nSo we refuse to do it alone because I you know there's too many red flags area I don't want to be on the news next week saying that a stroke went ahead and funded somebody's a extra ...

or do you want to say no we just had like I switched from ... to charter ooh God because they didn't like the harder and are not and I mean not charter and I didn't like the Eighteenth whatever we just had issues with the Internet\nAnd and our phones and they couldn't come out to even our home for like three days a TNT Sarah and I'm like but I'm using like for my business and I need it and they're like sorry we can't we can't send like okay well sorry to you too and I switched to charter and charter does\nOkay now I remember for conventional loans it's four years from the discharge yet\nF ha two years from the day so what what would cause that to be waived of and the actual verbiage is after one year extenuating circumstances you can go I get now\nExtenuating circumstance does not include a divorce mhm\nI'm you know somebody has some issues lost their job yeah that's actually not to consider is more like maybe a death in the family or a sickness or vows if a medical thing occurred so we had a customer that unfortunately one of the spouses\nA got a terrible foreign cancer mhm uh lost their job couldn't work and they went through a series of about a year and a half worth a medical bills and\nAnd then had to file chapter seven to wipe out everything they\nWe gave them a ... a year later because she\nThank God she's in remission mhm she had a reestablished her credit course over that year period paid her rent on time and that's important pay your rent\nOn time and by the way don't paying cash mhm okay you got to document that you made the payment so if you're renting from a a company that will take a company verification but from an individual you have cancelled checks are proof that you paid on time\nSo and if you don't have that you're not going to get the la area\nSo she went ahead she went into remission and we were able to give her an effigy alone a lot quicker so I lost a spouse a medical issue that consider extenuating circumstances aka divorce is still in your control to make the payments are lost her job unfortunately they think are the governments do things that uh\nUh that loss of you know if that's in your control and therefore\nThey're not going to give you that exception because of that so we keep in mind that F. ha has a lot more flexibility for foreclosures\nAnd for bankruptcy and you can buy a home even if you're in a chapter Thirteen when you're in the chapter so with ... with losing your job what if you didn't do anything wrong they're just laying off people will will they look into that are now just automatically you know that's it they say you could have got another job for less money\nOr you know I could have found something or if you're an account and you can still go flipping hamburgers or McDonalds or whatever it is that they have a bill to make something somewhere you don't have to file the batter you lost your job doesn't mean you can't go and buy or you may have had some credit issues mhm okay if you go ahead and not filed chapter Thirteen let's say you were\nAn engineer at Boeing ... and then you lose your job ... instead of making eighty thousand a year you know making forty thousand dollars a year managed McDonald's\nStore you you don't have to file chapter Thirteen you may have some creditors shifts but I think she will look at that and with a lot more leniency hey you got some credit I can ain't gonna get your less maybe ... what happened in regular life but it's not considered\nAnd extenuating circumstances that's the key verbiage and if they were forced to do so F ha what\nAn edge to add the population that file bankruptcy I don't know\nThat's a good question a lot more common today I was just going to set a ... you know it's a lot it's no longer an embarrassing thing it's not it's people are I mean it can look some people can think that way but I think it's more of a just okay he's he's going to try and start over and\nIt's it's ... ... today I mean I've had people say okay we're going to have filed chapter seven because we don't want to pay our bills anymore so we've lost a little bit of an element of\nSurprise I have to prove that has to approve it tonight in just decide you don't want to pay a\nLong process you get a good attorney and you're not the one speaking anyway let's turn to us so I think the other thing that you need to change the government does charge a very large feet up front that you will finance and your long you don't have to come up\nThat's certainly not a way to get people that do in\nThe disadvantages I'm not trying to convince you know just trying to tell you the truth and they charge monthly PM I but very often that we have customers that start with the F ha and then later on with the big alone yeah we refinanced them and we take away the P. M.
