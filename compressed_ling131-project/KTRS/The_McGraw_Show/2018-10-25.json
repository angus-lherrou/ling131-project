Soros is Obama's\nUh who else was their own Maxine Waters John Brennan at CNN Wasserman\nWhile debt the Debbie Wasserman Schultz won they sense whoever did this tried to send a bomb to Eric Holder but got the wrong address some Eric Holder and on the package the person put the return address as Debbie Wasserman Schultz so so they\nSaid that I think the senator vaccine so they sent it back to the return address for during the era and the return address was busy with\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz so ah I Would think they are fighting and now Robert De Niro\nEverything seriously it is truly a matter of time because it sounds like each of these or you know the the the spelling of the names and and maybe that's the throw them off who\nKnows you you have no idea right we should say that it was set to Robert Robert De Niro Z\nOffice I guess yeah he's right back after yeah [noise] um and they are saying that the bombs are similar in nature we basically have a serial bomber on the loose\nNow is it true I was listening to him I guess it was CNN and they were saying these\nPipe bomb types of bombs that are being sent aren't really\nPowerful enough well are even work\nTo go on well I don't I don't at this point I don't I don't know what we know because I can only assume that the feds are keeping whatever information they have\nClose to the close to the chest I I I'm assuming here that these are inch um\nBombs to do massive amounts of damage but I think the intent to write the intent is the terror part of it and so whatever little damage it in terms of where it is in terms of bombs I don't know if it's the um\nUm\nThe Atlanta Olympic bomb or some other rom right I don't know I don't know that\nBut I it it is meant to their apparently there functional they have some shards of glass in them that that's been reported I'm\nRent is CNN was that in LA or is\nThat in New York um Columbus Columbus Circle there in New York Stephanie Ramos ABC News correspondent at the White House could voice Stephanie Ramos he get morning President Trump last night spoke to a rally what did he say about this new American male bummer\nWhile he definitely took a different tone he had a more unifying message we initially heard from him at a at an event that was already scheduled where he said that the administration was extremely angry and upset and happy about they had about what they had witness\nYesterday in regard to the pipe bombs but then last night at that campaign style rally the president uh started a little differently he called for all sides to quote\nCome together in peace and harmony he did not specifically mentioned Hillary Clinton representative Maxine Waters CNN the Obamas or any of the others targeted yesterday and those are the names who are routinely mentioned\nIn his speeches at these campaign style rallies\nAny ah any comment about from the White House about him praising a politician who ah threw down a writer as just a few days ago and then all of a sudden you of is\nNot at all not at all I Know exactly what we're talking about and that the president applauding that politician for for bodies that reporter and\nGiving him the route of applause that that his his supporters eating it up and that's what they that's what they usually do at these rallies that is what you see when the president goes down this route of the ... of mocking or a plotting some sort of\nViolence or physical aggression he gets he he he gets applause for that and yesterday we saw last night at that rally up the latest rally we saw the yeah the president started off with a different message of civility and any unity but still\nKind of joked about his own change in tone saying see how I'm behaving we're all behaving and we're going to keep it that way will will see a but he also suggest that the media was to blame for those pipe bombs that were received throughout the day after I got\nOut of the blame the media for the pie bumps\nHe said the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility he said the the negative stories\nI'm a A R ... this is a result of of that coverage basically I mean we know the ... the president has been very critical of CNN and the past we know that we've seen that here in the press briefing room a one on one between Sarah Sanders and whoever that CNN correspondent as I said that's so that's no surprise\nUm but ... the president and in saying that the the ... the media ... bears responsibility for this you know\nSeems like CNN president Jeff Zucker is a a fighting back in some ways\nHe he is he put out a statement yesterday saying\nSomething along the lines at the White House has a lack of understanding or a lack of a understanding what what the consequences are when the president does go out there and continue and and and consistently\n... attack CNN or the media in general this is this is what happens they become targets I mean it's\nIt's clear that the the the targets were uh some critics that the president and others like their bombers who we don't really hear\nCome out against the president all that often as opposed to others that were targeted like Maxine Waters suggest sucker up putting that said been out there I'm not just not pleased with the White House's response to this\nSurvey Ramos what's what's the plan for the day with President Trump\nSo the president is expected to meet with Gina Haspel today after her trip to turkey to look into the murder of a Washington Post journalist or mall ... uh the Washington Post is reporting that Haspel while they're in Turkey was able to listen to the recordings\nThat that um [noise] a documented the interaction between ... and and those individuals and Saudi a consulate\nStuffy Ramos

Democrats all liberals All right there's there's all\nThe is the greatest hits when it comes to\nA criticizing Democrats I guess I'm ... now Robert De Niro um\nThey all the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz or John Brennan who's the former head of the CIA at CNN 'em all with the return address to visit the Debbie Wasserman shows in which the pipe bomb sent to Eric\nIs it a Debbie Wasserman Schultz in which the pipe bomb sent to Eric Holder former attorney general um\nThey send it to the wrong address so they sent it to the return address which was Debbie Wasserman Schultz which can only assume\nThat it was sent through the mail and not necessarily dropped off\nRight you have to assume that it's some of these at least were sent through the mail where we're we're we're we're kind of flying blind on a lot of information because they're not releasing a lot of information but\n... you could drop off a package if you want it to ride you could put the stamps on it you could drop it off which then wouldn't have the the Post's Marc on it that\nThere's set all different parts of the country right\nRight I don't work right somewhere right some work some were stopped uh after they went through the mail process and got to the secret service others were stopped\nIn all varying degrees and then they sort of alluded to the fact of this morning I was reading where some of them might have been dropped off by it but you have to drop it off at ... at a post office somewhere and then if you do that has opposed mark on somewhere so they know how to track where that package that package got to where it got so\nAccording to CNN police were called to the building or a ... Becca around for forty five this morning which was on the building seventh floor so I don't know if it actually got to the exact location that meant\nFor over wonder how ... how could it be delivered and then say this is suspicious but then you get through the mail\nThat was suspicious yeah and\nMaybe that's something even ask Brad Garrett how do you\nDetect that suspicious looking back\nAnd why and why does the person why why how can the secrets not critical of the post office at all buttons and um you know somebody who was it Robert De Niro production company there are no more trained in

offer that the buyer was contingent on the ... getting a loan up to Ninety five percent will be ... ... there's not really a lot of products out there\nThat would match that so then that's an out for that buyer so little things like that that consumers you don't need a ... little trickle down to the other thing is to consider is is pre qualifications and pre approvals so again\nGoing back on experience last week had two offers come in both of which look to be okay on the surface as you dig it and you realize that their pre approval letter was actually a pre qualification letter which there's a big difference because one involves underwriting ones that's not\nSo this pre qualification letter as we dug deeper into it had all kinds of\nWell we'll get them alone but first of all they haven't even applied yet I haven't verified anything and they were going to need this this and this and so when talking to the loan officer we found out that you would they be qualified right now based on the information they have no they absolutely would not be and they might not even be able to be qualified until sometime next year\nSo how do we not pressed into those type situations on the contract and just took surface information we could've lot that sell her up to have a deal fall through two months\nLater and so and then you take the house off the market in the old way to go to start over again yes yeah\nClosings make a difference here's another example know who the buyer is so for example we haven't had multiple the scenes are multiple offers last week one of the agents calls me and in conversation lets me know that the buyers had not even viewed the house yet but they're wanting to bump another buyer off\nOf a of an offer and go with theirs when the agent flat out said people are out of town they've not even see in the house are relying on me they're going to cut the next week and look at it now had I not had conversations with his age and and I just looked at an offer not asked questions we might have taken an offer that\nCould fall through next week when the buyer watt cynical\nAbout the pictures look like right on track right so ... thousand dollars is a relapse more lately absolutely\nDon't fall and the ... if you're a seller don't get caught up in the emotions of the buyer letter so again you've got you're looking at different\n... and you're getting sucked in by the early ...\nSadly my ground there yeah yeah but yeah but you write that letter\nWorking for you to work if I don't like me I mean we shouldn't tell you this\nLetter and you're

tell somebody who is showing a house and get so full price offered the first weekend and accept it was the house price to oh\nNo not in this market because typically what we had been seen although we're ... we're not seeing everybody racing than getting full price offers you right now is often but coming out of what we just came out of\nIt the houses priced too low it would sell for higher than the list price okay\nSo it's really kind of level market market value and\nIf you priced at too high ... then you don't get the multiple offers so it actually ... started to become a better strategy when things were super hot ... to come in at the lower side of things so that you bring more interest label and then everybody else would admit it up to the to the max that the market will\nBear so if

nationally have signed onto and support a lawsuit to get rid of the the remaining parts of the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare\nAnd part of that lawsuit gets rid of the protections that Obamacare offered for people with preexisting conditions that's just the fact it's it's in the lawsuit gets word for word\n... the same folks that signed onto that lawsuit have supportive of you know multiple votes I think thirty or forty maybe more votes in the in the house of representatives to\nTo overturn Obamacare So when Josh Holly runs an ad that says I support preexisting conditions\nIt's it's just the exact opposite of what he's done in action\nAnd and and to have that discussion\nIn in the public uh atmosphere is next to impossible these days because it has to be calm when you have a president who has been documented ally over and over and over again and that becomes the new standards it makes it impossible to have a discussion on tax\nThing I'll say is I'm a ... I Know Trump supporters sink um they're the only ones being picked on but there is a certain there's a certain portion of Trump supporters to certain portion of\nDemocrats liberals who are very similar in their antagonism in there we don't want to believe that the truth we don't want to pay attention to the other side rights they should have discussed and so no I'm not the turtle one you were the terrible on and on to each side\nTruly understands the point of view of the other person we're never going to get through this\nYou know when I used to cover the Missouri Senate ah it seems like a a a century ago but you know eight nine ten years ago\nI remember a debate one time or in which a Jason crowded and Curt Schaffer will going at each other too conservative Republican lawmakers 'em and they were getting\nIntense and crawl was having the better of Schaffer in shape first started getting a little personal when does criticism growl Ken and senator crowd stood up and said hey wait a minute\nYou want to argue my fat she want to argue my position\nLet's let's argue over that and again these were two Republicans going going at each other but don't question my motives\nAnd that's what\nOur our our political debate has become today everything is about motive because facts are no longer on the table I mean\nThat become very difficult to have an actual political conversation about what's really going on you can't discuss immigrants caravan ineffectual context because\nYou're disagreeing with what the president is saying and therefore you're just an enemy of the people who's going against the president instead of actually discussing what the facts are related to the immigrant caravan or preexisting conditions or the fact that\nThe ... when it's cold\nPolls very very positively but then when you ask the exact same question and call it Obamacare get both negative way back to the reality of of our political discussion today and it makes it very difficult for well meaning people most people who are ... or more like my wife who are not\nDemocrats or Republicans or even involved in a daily basis in political discussion but every four years you know show up at the polling place\nAnd and and become involved in the very important political system that we have\nIt it it becomes impossible to have these these reason discussions of policy and that's frustrating\nI said yesterday well even with this I said yesterday if only these elected officials could actually that the power to pass a law to fix our immigration system to sort of compromise and come up with some type of plan to solve some of these problems if they only had the power to write laws like that boy it would be much better place\nThey've got the power they don't have the will\nDoes hold on a thing and now does he have to go and have or sign off on this\nNo she doesn't even know you just have to bring somebody ... dinner find information to show that you're married\nTo a marriage certificate maybe your divorce decree and so I'm tell them this and so he says yeah I'm going to go down there and go get that taken care of so he sends me this email me says Kevin did exactly what you told me to do that brought my divorce decree I even have a marriage certificate down there and I was married twenty three years\nWas when I sat down at this office and this is one here in this area it's said I was advised that I'm not eligible to receive or Social Security benefit because my check is greater than half of her check\nAnd you know so then I started I started thinking wait a second here that sounds like a really reasonable thing he sounds this person sounds like it's all correct and I started doubting myself\nAnd then I take a step back and I say\nYou know they've done this quite a few times why am I doubting myself because I've been doing this for a long time so here's what I did I jumped on Social Security is the website and I found exactly where it says he's eligible for it I copy and paste and I think the bacterium email so here's the thing\nSocial Security gave him the wrong information\nMore giving him the right information unfortunately some times when we go and we ask for advice from people\nAre like Social Security or any other types of offices sometimes they just don't know what they're talking about they think they know but they don't know and and I see obscene is tons of times where people just did what they told them to do\nBecause they told them the wrong information\nSo now this guy goes back and he does actually started receiving the I'm ex spouse benefits getting a seven hundred and fifty dollars a month and the reason you're doing this because he wants to get paid by the way in his benefit is get benefits guaranteed to grow by eight percent\nSo not only do you get the eight percent you get the cost of living adjustment which this year is going to be two point eight percent it's a guaranteed ten point eight percent increase in your check\nThat's why he's doing it but Social Security gave him the wrong information and it's very unfortunate because stuff like this happens a lot and here's the funniest thing this guy McGraw has had for financial advisors\nNever told he was he was eligible for this\nIt's not one of them told him he was eligible for these types of benefits\nSo we do we talk about this on the show the ... the other day and I am a friend who's divorced a nice woman that I Know she's divorced she's a retirement age your husband is a retirement age\nAnd I told her that hey you can apply for his ... no I Can't\nI said yeah you can know like you know my guy didn't tell me that I mean she was almost angry with me when I was explaining to or what you were explaining the husband was retired it doesn't matter I don't want my husband to know he doesn't like you don't have to go ... signed by him it's amazing how many people don't notice\nAnd and really put their head in the sand and don't want to know this ...\nI I think we want to know what I mean think about we do want to know this information but the problem is as we've been trust in this this financial person our entire lives or this is the amount of time we've been with them\nAnd it's hard to think that they're actually wrong and they've been given us the wrong information and I'm and I'm telling you McGraw Ninety percent or more financial advisors financial planners are not real financial planners\nAnd I'll I'll go back and just say most of them talk about investments and investments only they use some sort of computer generated programs to help with financial planning and then they that's all they do\nThey don't talk about how you can not pay tax how to avoid taxes how to maximize your Social Security how it all actually comes together\nThis individual he was losing out on a significant amount of money um for the next four years that he was just going to delays benefit to Seventy and not even get paid so she got paid a significant amount of money over the next four years while he's waiting\nSo here's the thing I Can't control that the market was down yesterday or the down last week of the week before that and I can't control it the market comes back up\nBut what I can do is make sure that my clients control the things that they should control so when that stuff happens it doesn't affect them that much like that individual getting over nine thousand dollars a year in those Social Security benefits that helps the situation\nTo me when people are out there who are divorced married more than ten years divorce eligible for these benefits and not going and getting them either because they're guy or gal not done um or the Social Security office isn't telling them the way to do it that's why you gotta call Kevin ... is your within five years over time it's\nThree one for six for one ten ten three one for six for one ten ten and of course the website when retirement happens dot com Leno's show on the weekend chock full of information like that given a good ... thanks for checking in and we'll talk to you this weekend\nYou both have a great day then again in an amazing it really is\nRight my my friend three other financial advisors life right now the oh by the way have you on the gear divorce yeah how long are you married twenty something years to get a great well uh you know you can you can collect is\nYou can collect has been no I Can't on a whim I Know I I just get no he's he's not retired yet he's delaying no other understand that that's not that's not part of the deal\nYou know that in ... and now that you need to call Kevin all I Know I don't think you really do but\nYou know it's unbelievable through in four six four one tent and that's one of about a million things or you will help us if you are close to retirement and or retired called Yemen Lloyd what you don't know really or just a through in four six four one tent and a

a there's a there's a terrorist on the loose who is\nSort of 'em right he's he's engaging so that's really all we know I don't know how to spin it any other way I don't know how to talk about it we don't know much that's kind of all we know\nUm we now know that they've sent a devices to Joe Biden to I'm John Brennan at CNN Eric Holder\nA that was sent to the wrong address so they sent it to the

well of course pass it along but as of now\nI don't know how to I don't know how to spin so I'm not I'm not a very good I guess I'm not very good talk shows 'cause I don't understand how to spin it though there is something else that I find kind of interesting sort of on this kind of similar topic may maybe not\nAnd that is this I'm Jamal 'cause showed me this Washington Post columnist who was living in America\n[noise] legally right he was a resident of America and for all indications who's doing everything he could to become a citizen but he was working as a Washington Post journalist he came to America he sought asylum in America\nBecause he was a fearful of a intimidation of public shaming um the you weren't allowed to speak your mind in\nSaudi Arabia so he came to America because he wanted to fight for all the freedoms that we take for granted right criticizing\nThe government uh living the way you want to live right not fear for your safety when you speak up against whatever current government use ah the you uh you have or you want\nRight [noise] a pretty special place this this country is and then from all accounts the man is murdered on foreign soil now\nIt's the it was this Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey and I know that's weird illegally because it was on its on foreign soil I don't know if that's technically deem Saudi Arabians soil or if it's deemed Turkish toy soil I I don't know but he was American resident\nWasn't a citizen\nHere's my question for you now we don't know what happened\nAnd we can sort of gas and then he was murdered in some way shape or form because now the Saudis are now saying something went terribly wrong we don't know what happened to the body but now we're going on three weeks let me ask you a very simple question\nWhat should the American government do if he were an actual citizen\n\nIf he had a he he got it legally I I don't know I don't and I haven't read anything about the legal status of somebody who was here legally right he was legally allowed to work\nHe was legally allowed to be here he was going to get married I'm\nFrom all different from all accounts he was well on his way to becoming\nA citizen of this country but he was\nSo if a citizen is killed\nIn on foreign soil by a foreign government that happens to be friendly with Americans what is our responsibility what is our job what what right is is are we supposed to defend one citizen well\nRight [laughter] if you're kidnapped we do all sorts of things\nTo write to deter people from kidnapping other Americans we don't negotiate with terrorists but we still don't have any type of form of relationship with Iran because they took some of our Americans hostages for four hundred and forty four days\nHere Saudi Arabia kills a resident if they would've killed and American what what has been our response\nAnd so we live in a world where an American resident was killed for speaking out against a foreign government killed for speaking his mind killed for his\nRight for his thoughts for his writings and I don't really see a whole lot of people upset by that that's really that's really disturbing to me\nJust what would have happened if he were in American\nWould we would we still be like well whatever I don't know it just seems there's there should be more of an outcry here in America\nSeems like there was more of an outcry when Amanda Knox was arrested for murder in in Italy then there was for this man who was came to America because we're the last to beacon of freedom\nGo side and then he found his his friends in Miami elect guard even is married and he moved out and I think for twelve thousand dollars\nAnd ... used to pay I called a conflict here in D.C I've say hey I I Would get you if this is my in my name in a life\nAnd the
