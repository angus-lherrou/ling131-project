improving tuning for mortgages and more which doing that to me where we can go all the different types of mortgage programs in simple terms\nYou and me hilly you become an extra after the first show listened to mortgages it more with Julie at its new time Sunday mornings at Nottingham on K T. R. S. [noise]\nCome back to we're having a senior moment Katie are asked [noise]\nWelcome back everybody and thanks again for all the calls that we've had\nA pouch or new segment on the show called the medical moment and so he's agreed to join us again and we'll keep bringing back crush the gear as long as you guys are good with it so don't be afraid to give him a call to give us a call and we talked last week\nAbout a Christmas thoughts around minerals the mineral deficiency did I get that right Chris yeah that's what we'll be talking about this week so hit us with it and again this is Dr ... of the gear health and wellness clinic\nAnd his officers are located increase core right and I we I sixty four highway forty for all of us old folks um and balanced wrote in the seven seven seven building are great clinic so\nTalk to us a little bit about this concept of mineral deficiency\n[noise] yeah so um you know I wanted to shed some light on this and not just it's effect on our bones but just our health in general and uh you know something we're told with osteoporosis is uh we're lacking calcium in reality we're lacking a lot of minerals and that and the calcium in this case\nBut early warning signs to look for just the white spots on your nails including you know they're just in\nYes I did look right down it might not even saying that a fingernail okay you know white spots thankfully but a lot of times\nThat's indicative that we need the minerals you know ... maybe not one specific one but you know it's a just a cause for looking a little further but\nPolitically we want to ask um are we getting these minerals in our food and secondly I we digest thing in absorbing that food are adequately so you know taking high amounts of calcium supplements is that it's not always the answer I mean sometimes it can cause more harm than good\nUm you know what happens when we get too much free floating calcium in our blood ... bone spurs can get kidney stones or even the calcium deposits mammograms or what we have ...\nUm too much calcium can also push out or displaced other important minerals like magnesium potassium and those are two huge minerals for heart health\nSo you know we need enough to stomach acid to break these things down mineral speaking\nTo break our feet down so that we can extract those minerals or to break the minerals down themselves in\nBrick ... so the the minerals are bound together in a certain way\nThe minerals down themselves break\nSo the the minerals are kind of bound together in a certain way and when he in the stomach acid to be able to break apart into we can absorb them um after that [noise]\nAh so what the influx of you know having to so many antacid some ... ... it's a really make it a lot tougher ourselves to do this just natural a digestive process\nSo are you know we end up making less and less stomach as soon as we as we age and we talked about this last week our you know it's very rare that we're producing too much stomach acid or so you know it's odd that were prescribed so much and pass it\nBut if we can't absorb calcium um we can cause calcium deposits related to osteoporosis heart disease and heart attack\nUm but the bodies really tried to tell us something if we get indigestion if you see those white spots on your nails or even a poor growth of your hair fingernails\nAnd certainly what we see the bone spurs or kidney stones I'm already even a calcium deposits rather joins mhm [noise] so um you know what's the cause of this poor calcium usage lessons of her drinking carbonated drinks\nOr too little stomach acid and antacid use okay so we're functional medicine we focus on digestion and absorption in this case um you know a lot of our patients improve digestion a relief from heartburn and then you know as well stronger hair nails and skin by just boosting their digestive system\nSo I'm not saying if you're taking calcium supplements it's a bad thing just make sure you have the right call factors and digestive ability to use them so I'm going to leave a link on the website with easy to follow the recommendations on this topic but it's a big one and I think it was very useful for the listeners to get a hold of\nYou know what it really really is an an an okay folks I don't know how many of you when he said that it could show up as\nWhite spots on your fingernails how many of you look down um but I got to tell you everybody in the room here did and so it's kind of funny because we all look for simple ways to find out what's going on and what's going wrong and how do we fix it and you know you talked about kidney stones and that\nToo much or inappropriate forms of calcium in our bloodstream can lead to that and and that's that's an incredible fought because\nI mean I see it all the time my my friends are talking about that and what you're saying is that if we're doing a better job with our nutrition if we're doing a better job in terms of getting the coal factors that we need if we're doing a better job\nOf just managing our bodies overall than we don't end up with the stuff yeah\nYeah and that's achieved with you through the functional Madison aspect and there's a chiropractic manipulation in adjustments and things like that right\nYeah I mean we're really dealing with sub clinical disease meaning it's it hasn't manifested to a disease yet you know there's a lot of parents precursors that we can pick up on sure it will get ourselves back imbalance become before it becomes a big issue\nIn ... and again folks

the app as well so\nAgain a Stewart's AMC dot com or you can go I had just Google bailout and sell Rob you want to know how\nThat okay so here's here's what happened [noise]\nFirst of all okay Yahoo Google convinced me Yahoo yes Yahoo and Google convinced me yup that having a weird name for a kind of a childish name yeah that's what I Would call it\nDoesn't necessarily mean that there's a lack of integrity or that you're not big or ... or ... yeah when I when I was growing up if you have a name like Google will look at you like this is a company is\n... is higher right so that's that's one of the things that\nConvinced me to go ahead and create something called the bagel bad and the other thing that convinced me that people normally don't thinking numbers they thinking pictures yeah oh on the hundred percent ... right yup\nSo if people want to remember the best deal around or they want to remember what the options are if you give them something to to picture mhm they're going to remember\nThat garlic bagel with an old guy go except that some people are telling\nMhm I remember at all a bagel with them yeah it'll sell guy go except that some people I tell them they go on and there's no clothes and cars and they can't figure out\nWhat the bagel has with no clothes and cars yeah well so and I explained it to the early ... looks like a zero it out it says no closing costs involved in a transaction at all\nI still get people saying okay you're going to roll and the title outlet Iran and tell me ... no there's no title fees there's nothing is no closing costs at all you get the same or better rate than anybody else that's out\nThere mhm Thirty Years' worth of service my personal cell phone number a Thirty Years' worth of experience I should say not service will I mean\nWell certainly kind about it that you know Thirty years in the industry has that\nDown ticket in the market can affect how they're raising interest rates and for the for the last time this year well I think I think that the housing market to slow down the housing market which is probably the biggest ticket item in our country that you don't see too many\nYou're not going to buy a car for four hundred thousand dollars I mean yeah ... ... is slowing down and when people buy homes\nThan other industries get affected Home Depot gets affected and so on and so forth so if you see is falling in the housing market that could be an indication that can cause\nOther markets to slow down which was slow down our economy data okay so I'm looking at the illness was like a tremendous stop and\nOr slow down in the housing market in our in our region and I wouldn't be surprised if that slows down the economy and so maybe we'll hear the Federal Reserve in March sometimes and you know what we're going to raise it but we're going to be very very cautious and doing these raises so\nI just think if you're considering buying a home people usually push it off the spring because they want to move into a house when the new school you know in August by August and it's not freezing and it's not freezing if you want to get a deal\nI think and the interest rates are not bad right now they could go out [laughter] you know what I'm saying that you know I think we've got to come down with it you\nCan get the better deal right now yeah and if you buy a home now and you get the five percent for example interest rate if rates go down in March or April guess what I can do for you\nCan float down while you can't wait to home you can read and you can do it can refinance and has a bagel and there's no closing costs so you don't lose anything most people have always thought that doesn't pay to refinance your your alone\nIf you're not saving a whole percent or three quarters of ... percent or ... percent on your mortgage because the cost offset the benefit\nIf you go with the big alone which has no claws and costs you're not losing anything there's immediate savings so she ended up getting five percent are somewhere around there today and then in six months from now the rates dropped that all you do is refinance for free and they go you're not going again so I Would encourage\nAnybody that's considering buying a house do it now you get the better prices then you would I think that you're going to get in spring\nOkay you'll pay a little bit more in the interest rate maybe now versus later if interest rates shoot up and you definitely did great yeah so it's almost a win win option if interest rates go down you refinance with a bagel if interest rates go up then you've got you a great deal and you're you're in great shape so don't procrastinate this go ahead and do it\nAnd get it on our next segment of them are ... and kind of tell us talking about we're going to talk about next segment I Want to talk about\nThe customer service but I Want to talk about another bank of America thing it just happened oh my Florida yeah yeah yeah yeah and we're also going to talk about effort ha loans and a little bit more about credit card debt so they'll get way I\nLook at it away don't go away it's actually ...\nI really think that the fact that you can ... everyone's going to stay in lifting everything you just said you're going to\nTalk about well I think they can lose because you're on the show ... we'll be right back [noise]\nHave a question for you

I have between ambrosia is all I had all these rules now between between\nApplications and closings I have ten to twenty a day\nYou know that's a lot that's a lot of people from my ... my wife or I Love things\nOut there how many husbands here things have been was when they watch call them the wives expect them to answer on the spot so I my best friend has the same challenge that he's a doctor and a physician my wife calls me and she just expect me to stop doing what I'm doing and\nThey just have to come to monitor this actually it's a great story because this particular customer before I go into the other finds\nShe was looking for cash flow she's a nice elderly women or men women widowed and she has a installment loan for two thousand dollars and she wanted to in clubs include\nThe two thousand dollar debt mhm in the long ball if your path other dead it's considered a cash out refinance and the rates are different than if you hire a lower their higher\nSo an existing mortgage and redoing is called the rating term that's a lower rate okay but when you're refinanced your loan\nYou have to increase the loan amount to cover the amount of taxes and insurance that has to be an escrow account\nRight mhm you understand that oh yeah okay I'll feel a hundred and fifty thousand and then you have five thousand dollar escrow requirement we're going to give you a loan of a hundred and fifty five thousand yeah to cover the cover that we can bring in the money but that's what most people do their they add to among the five grand [noise]\nShe has an America trade account with ten thousand dollars and then she doesn't want to take the money out but I told her to do this take out the money pay off the two thousand marijuana mhm\nWill close you're alone when you get your escrow refund from your prior loan reimbursed yourself to two thousand dollars you pay may go so you actually ended up financing\nThat two thousand dollars because of the fact that you're getting and that's an escrow refund indirectly and you've got the better rate\nShows he's sure bank and help with that now sure no so she did it that way and all of a sudden she's like oh my God now I Am I going to drop
