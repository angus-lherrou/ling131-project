S. policy is well there are two important of a\nOf a friend to tell them right from wrong\n[noise] well yeah but if you want my opinion we've always just the you know this is what I call sort of a desktop for our\nPeople you know get outraged that at the end of the day they don't actually do anything to change but let's face it it's a really a moral business when it comes to the intelligence intelligence collection and to a certain extent I suppose business\nThat those two things are going to rise above what is right and wrong and because of our relationship as I just talked about with with Saudi Arabia as well as the number of other countries\nThat that are into big time brutality based on our definitions of that um that ... it's just going to go on because right or wrong the girl that ... runs a world\nWhile right but I mean what's the difference between gassing children in Syria and killing a journalist in in Turkey why why are we are morally outraged over one and not the other let's just be friends with all the dead spots in the middle east\nWell I you know in on some levels even the ones McGraw that we act like that we hate we still have relationships with on the intelligence services work together\nA from terrorism to fill in the blank so that even Iran I mean people think you know obviously our relationship with them as is horrible that do we work with their intelligence services that's my belief and understanding so that's how this works\nUm and I think most people go well that's not right well of course morally it's not right at all but that is how it works\nYeah quickly while we still have you a lot of tension in this uh Wisconsin a story of this Thirteen year old a girl who's missing the parents were murdered in his home in Wisconsin or what do we know about this story\nIt appears very little I mean the sheriff in this very rural community about Seventy five miles from a think Milwaukee is it it seems like they're a bit stuck I mean you've got a Thirteen year old dismissing parents were shocked to death\nOn you know the odds McGraw that that's a random and a stranger did that is really small\nSo when does it in her life Thirteen year old or the parents like is there are there are drugs involved is there a financial debt involved what is going on in their three lives from you know you're going to look obviously social media cell phones hardline calls interviews people in the community\nSo you know something is going to get connected I think between three and in ... and then why is Jamie not there you know why did they take er there's gotta be some motivation to that obviously to that kind of play into whatever the final answer is to this\nThis on top of that story earlier this summer with Molly tidbits who was out running in Iowa who ended up getting killed on the side of the road so terrible story when it comes to rural homes spawned save 'em rural America so All right Brad Garrett ABC News crime and terrorism thanks for checking and have a good day\nThanks to care seven twenty six year big five fifty Katie arrest will do numbers will do that next year big five fifty gay tiara and dental care\nBeat oh eight I and I got a number for your number one that's um how many more minutes that so many um\nOffices he has won a that's he's not a corporate tendency has hasn't sold out he's he goes to work and he's been going to work there his father's been going to work there for generations\nTo the business over for his dad but that doesn't mean he can't do everything to big corporate census can do he does and I'd argue he does it better than everybody else because\nHe focuses on the patient\nFocuses on you many times and I've seen it I've been in the office where people call now like my dentist doesn't do this or my dentist wants to charge me twenty five thousand dollars\nCan I come in and talk to you absolutely that's what he does go in and talk with him he's got plenty of models he's got plenty of space plenty of time to sit and explain how dental implants work and or implant dentures and if you've got dentures\nAnd you're tired of them flopping around your mouth and not being secure column because\nI'd have small small fraction of the price you already have the dentures\nNow all you need all the implants and it's a very relatively simple procedure um I Would have Dr Boeing doing but you're enters probably might not do it it might even not even bring it up to you\nThat's why Boeing dental care is doing so well his bedside manner and there's nobody has three one for nine to one thirty five hundred or enforced in on done road B.

I'm a ... a last week or a couple of weeks ago you did a story about I'm being arrested for being poor and it was a pretty interesting story you're now back with a part too which is even more disturbing than the first one you talked about\nWhat a lot of counties throughout Missouri is is very similar to what\nWe're used to here in St Louis what we reported on a lot\nBack in twenty four and a twenty Jay related to them you know it's awkward throughout St Louis county only what's happening in rural Missouri is worse basically people are getting arrested for small offenses are one of the women that I've written about actually two different women that I've written about\nRelated to this case both in ... county got arrested for shoplifting makeup and and I'm not condoning shoplifting but in one case it was twenty four dollars worth of of a nail polish and in another case it was literally an eight dollar Cuba mascara\nThey get arrested actually get jailed rather than just issued a summons because they the judge that's bad they can't afford bail so they're in jail for\nFor a period of time sometimes thirty days or longer before they can get a public defender get a bond hearing whatever\nThey end up pleading guilty to something that maybe they only get probation or they get time served so they get thrown in jail for their shoplift\nChin or they get time served so they did thirty days in jail for their shoplifting which isn't necessarily unreasonable if that's the standard you set in your community but then this is what happens the county status them a bill for their time in jail and it's about fifty bucks a day\nThese are people that couldn't afford\nA ... a small amount of bail a couple of thousand bucks to get out of jail now they've got this bill\nFor several hundred dollars or a couple of thousand dollars for their time in jail and then the judge said some months we're hearing called a show cause hearing come in and show me that you're paying your bill or that you pay down and not be your ...\nSometimes they missed one of those hearings sometimes they show up and they say sorry judge I don't have any money I haven't been able to pay ... stand it puts them in jail for a probation violation\nThe woman that I wrote about this last week broke broke and did a year in jail after her eight dollar shoplifting charge because she felt behind paying her jailed bill\nHer jailed bill now I wrote in the column is more than ten thousand dollars\nI Would stay spoke with her last night each Eighteen thousand dollars now she's got to go to court again in November to show the judge sorry I haven't been able to make payments on it you keep kicking me away from my kids and away from my job and then you get me an extra bill when I go to jail\nShe may get sent to jail again in that Eighteen thousand dollar bill becomes something something else can committed any other crime sense that\nIt is it is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen it is purely a debtors prison\nAnd it's happening I've written about it in St Francis county it's happening in ... county it's happening and Crawford county it's happening all over the state and this was a massive problem for the Missouri judiciary\nTony I thought you mention debtors prison we all learned about it in high school it was illegal how does it will be legal in the state of Missouri\nBecause what they're arguing is that\nThe the jail bill they call it a board bills don't bore during all they're arguing and the public defender's office just before the appeals court all three appeals courts in the state saying that there's this constitutional\nWhat what these county judges are arguing is that the board bill is part of the fine in court costs\nAnd so they're arguing that these people because they aren't paying they're fine they haven't fulfilled\nThe original sentence so they're the judge is arguing that says and debtors prison I'm not putting them in jail because they're poor I'm not putting them in jail because they can't stay at that I'm putting them in jail because they haven't fulfilled their probation\nBash the argument I think it was on its surface\nAt least one appeals court has already ruled that you can't keep adding up these court costs on decay suits and and and then put people in jail that the the judge just wrote it creates this endless merry go round that um\nThat that these poor people in these rural counties are having to deal with and\nUltimately I think the Missouri Supreme Court is going to have to not only rule on these cases to tell these ... just you can't do this anymore\nYou're gonna have to have the Supreme Court issued new rules in some guidance so these judges no it's just not reasonable practice and down and watch the county's realize they can't fund themselves on the backs of poor people you're going to have to face some of the same questions we're facing here in St Louis county\nEvery one of the hundred and fourteen counties in the state need their own courthouse need their own uh you know judicial system or do we need to start talking about some form of judicial consolidation so that we're\nSo that the initial courts that people are dealing with in our society are are run with the same sort of professionalism and expectation that we'd like to see and all of our judicial system\nTony this was an amazing story of this one woman how do we know it just isn't this one woman out any more evidence of this being widespread happening ... scores of completely\nWidespread I've been emailing with public defenders all over the state and I will be writing about this nonstop for a period of time there are all sorts of cases and every time I find one I get three or four more calls from others I'm working on cases in Franklin County St Francis county\n... county Crawford county down in southwest Missouri it is widespread and there are fewer judges that have been identified as sort of the worst offenders a but it is something that is happening in lots of rural counties all over Missouri\nOr is it working its way to the Supreme Court or you just stay on as it is\nThere are three cases right now before the the the the three appeals courts in the state eastern southern west or\nA affecting different parts of the state and those three cases are all brought by Matthew Mueller who works for the state public defender and their cases on behalf of poor people who got minor charges but\nThen it ended up doing larger in jail time because they couldn't afford to pay the jail bill and and they're asking the court to declare that practice on last\nNight ... is it we got a text message here on the line and they're saying that these are the cases in states are not the county charges\nCorrect these are there any ... and my my one of my columns explained why the reason they county wants these people convicted on stage charges it is because they're they're holding them in their jail on state charges they get reimbursement from the state\nWhich means you and I our tax dollars\nAre paying for this and so they're double dipping\nHere's what happens there counting pills the stage because any state charge that you're holding somebody in your county jail on the state reimburse if it's about twenty two dollars a day but then they go ahead and build a poor person who was stuck in jail for fifty dollars a\nWhere you can see their full inventory and get useful information like until one guy that will help you make sure your vehicle into the unit you want to buy easy

just put a final\nCap on the woman with the video and the condo downtown St Louis\n...\nOh is she filming anybody know there was no the media probably look below my just wanted to see what the layout was\nSo yesterday late late in ... in the show I floated my theory that she wasn't\nIt wasn't a racist um wasn't racist that she was asking the guy first key fob it wasn't safety\nIt was that she was hitting on the guy\nAnd it went it was she was hitting on the guy and it went completely wrong and then um what happened was she got into the elevator where oh where do you stay and then\nHe was kind of like well you're a bit of a ... and so I'm not I'm a black man I'm not getting into an elevator with a white blonde woman in downtown St Louis who knows what can happen let me turn my video on I turned my video on she's like oh well where do you live follow me to my house right only to keep this on and then she got then then she was like\nOh my goodness\nI put myself out there and I was just rejected by this man ... he is going to pay\nNothing worse than the woman scorned so I was explaining this theory yesterday to a couple of people off the air\nAnd they're like no no no she was drunk and I was like yeah OK\nYou think she's drunk\nAll the more reason she was sitting on the guy [laughter]\n[laughter] I I Am not kidding I Am getting events this woman was hitting on this guy he was like a bit of a creep her black man I better turn on my video camera you don't know what can happen you don't know what she can say who wouldn't believe me if I got an elevator and she had a rich blouse\nSo let me just turn on my camera and let me go into my apartment\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it\nI'm Still with you on that really so then he went racist with\nNo he didn't go round on just he just posted the video won't notice caption though was all about how he felt the victim of racism\nOh well yeah I'm sure this crazy woman was you know it was such a\nBad hit by her yes\nYeah no I'm convinced that discredited I just I and and it's just better it's a better theory I had a really bad something well and she if she was married to a black man so maybe they already has the inkling that she was attracted to a darker skin man\nIt was a quick rejection that they both that she picked up and so then she got all sassy and that's\n... you know she ... let's just you know maybe she was maybe she had a couple maybe you know maybe she was ... she was and I don't know but people are saying she clearly was drunk okay well if she's drunk and that\nLends itself to my to my side of the the argument we all do dumb things were drunk right and it's all of a sudden she writes once the guy was once a woman\nOnce a woman initially\nPut yourself out there and then the man rejects the woman you got to find some way to cover yourself that strikes me as a man asks a girl out\nThe ... hey do you wanna go see the images that she was like you were discussing ... leave me alone the guy's like well I I tried who walks away girls aren't that way and go hey would you want to go to the movie I usually like ... thank you very much but I think you know really well you're a jerk you're going to pay for that around here are gearing idiot\nYeah because women can't accept no as an answer\nTrust me you're on the drivers went\nCrazy speaking from experience that's why you know you want to

eighty six percent or forty two point five percent but and this isn't I'm not being\nI'm not being sexist I'm you're right I'm I'm being anecdotal right there are when when you tell women know when when women especially a drunk on when women are told no they tend to sometimes\nUm lose control a little bit\nI won't fly off the handle\nA girl and the lights right\nNow I Know so I'm sticking with my theory and a lot of people were like no and then some\nAnd so I'm sticking with my theory and a lot of people were like no and then some people ... ... that's an willy willy doesn't want to admit it but that's a pretty good theory\nI Can't describe it as a theory got ...\n... ... it got totally blown out of proportion she then called the cops because I had to come and then of course she couldn't say well I was trying to hit on the guy and he rejected me so I kinda felt bad\nIt's got a safe is so right she has to do what's that that that's where I draw the line she can't say racist because that's a ... so then she's got to say no it's safety\nSee that's where that's where I you lose me because she has been vilified she has been smeared she might that change your name cetera et cetera if that were true what you're saying I Would have just admitted like you know what I hit on on that went badly [laughter] forget this yes\nYou would and I would want\nTo raise that no matter what it had not a guy at the end it better it is better as a woman to be known as a racist and by the end of that and I reject not buying it\nLook is the is the um [noise] it is the to kill a
