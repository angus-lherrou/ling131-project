the end of the day Hooters that well that could cut it both ways my girl a cash usually helps stronger leader the guy in the White House ah ah the but usually that's a man with a steady hand it to tailor Donald Trump is both the\nThe a strong leader and the provocateur tour the cause of that show\nRight now we're still looking at Republicans winning the Senate to keeping the Senate maybe adding sheets fifty for maybe a close last for Republicans in the house\nYou know it's interesting as you bring up a great point after uh nine eleven [noise] uh right after the challenger with with with with Ronald Reagan after nine eleven with with President Bush right there were these national tragedies where are the president's would would get and command\nThe cameras and and and to help a sad nation but but Donald Trump isn't picking up any of that good will because he just doesn't want it\nNever he never becomes the president he always remains the candidate\nWho is campaigning who's polarizing energizing his base\nHe never elevation herself to that leader of all Americans I was talking to someone the other day it was just it you know what it would be great if the president would resign from his political party when he was elected and say\nLook I'm Still a Republican or a Democrat and that's what I Believe but I'm going to be president of all the people know\nBoy when we think of things like that it tells you how divided polarized we really are at the moment\nWell whether you are a Democrat or a Republican president I think the idea is that they are usually president of everybody and even though they bought their own party once in awhile miss president\nLoves the fact that has championed the facts commentators like you have commented that he doesn't want to be a president for everybody he he wants\nTo eat right this is he he plays to his base that's all he cares about and that's his that's that's why he was elected\nAnd there may be a larger reason for that and that is he wants to really destroy the old Washington establishment of both parties he is not a a he is not a unifying force here's the very opposite that's why his voters sent him there because\nHis supporters he Washington is a threat to the country that can't be fixed unless it is torn down for Donald Trump is the wrecking ball that comes that does the job before the builders come in\nHouse costs on us if Democrats take control of the house of course they're going to do a lot of investigations allows subpoenas and all that but is there an upside to the Republican Party entered Trump if the Democrats do take over the house\nWell I think you could see two things happened want is it would be good for Trump politically because he would campaign or as the brake pedal against Washington Democrats who are going to the extreme\nA show yes I think that would help him but also remember Trump is really not a Democrat or Republican but he does love dispense specially if it's not his money you get a Democratic House\nDonald Trump in the White House the Republican Senate would be the only thing standing between\nDonald Trump's spending more to stimulate the economy when the fed is trying to tighten up interest rates so stay tuned this is going to be a new political geometry in twenty Nineteen\nThat's a great point we're talking about Paul Ryan for a second speaking of the house he came a burst onto the scene talking about cutting entitlements and ... and all being about the debt he leaves a as speaker of the house with the national debt ballooning like never before a demand when the opposite way what happened\nBefore uh the man when the opposite way what happened\nWell erosion politics to become a potential vice president leader the Republican Party\nKind of ... out of town as a failed account for the man who was not able to balance the books or early\nShow right now if you're getting the tax cut through is your only accomplishment Republicans really credited order Trump then right\nYeah yeah so uh it's interesting how he he leaves and he was he was a deficit hawk and he had he had a lever and never used it to\nA girl he was the leader of the city and encouraging the

sat down\nAnd it wasn't great so we just took a day by day and\nMy sisters my mom my dad my parents and my wife's\nHave all their kids at school\nAnd we live in LA just had\nWell not necessarily other people but some body or some entity dishes or\nI've written to columns on this and I'm working on on another follow up basically you have a situation where a whole bunch of lawmakers got letters from\nA allegedly their constituents with with names and addresses and emails are advocating for the state legislature to ah change the law to make it harder for out of state people to connect with the state\nPeople uh on class action lawsuits this is\nSomewhat of a um reaction to the Johnson and Johnson shout out or law states including the big four point seven billion want him in the city of St Louis this summer and the effort is being pushed by\nThe U.S chamber of commerce\nAnd what state lawmakers got a bunch of letters from constituents and some of them recognized the names and called them and and and the people are saying to the law makers and to me I didn't send an email\nI don't care about that issue or I don't know about that issue where I disagree on that issue but I definitely did send you this email and the chamber of commerce and it's very I guess I'm a nurse and contractors are saying we didn't do anything wrong\nWe've investigated those are actual emails we show IP address as they came to the website to send a letter\nAnd it's a mystery right now and I'm Still looking into it to try to get to the bottom the bottom line is these folks tell me quite clearly they did not know sweaters and so now you have state lawmakers\nGore saying what can I Believe when I get letters from lawmakers it could have a real damaging of fat on citizens ability to uh\nHave an influence on their lawmakers if all of a sudden lawmakers aren't able to believe that he's emails are real and I can tell you and this is one of the things that I'm working on this has happened in other places with either entity it's become a real problem in state legislatures\nOkay Toni there's there's a there used to be not so long ago where somebody would say hey write a letter to your congressman come to our website sign up will generate a form letter and send it to the congressmen the senator or the politician whatever right and so\nThe politician the elected official the journalist wouldn't get\nAny letters they'd all be the same but they'd be signed by somebody different are they\nWhat happened and that's what happens here but people are saying I go to that website I didn't\nBreak out that letter I didn't register I didn't sign up that's what they're saying and that's where the dispute is right now\nSo it's more or less like rushing box have got a hold of this letter and it just sort of ... you know like they do on on on social media they generated likes and re tweets abusing people's real names but nobody knows who's doing it\nI Want to be careful that said that I don't necessarily believe that it's it's Russian botched I don't know what it is if if my last column wasn't clear or their lawyers involved with the U.S chamber of being a very aggressive in terms of trying to uh make sure that the system's cashed in\nIn a negative fashion to them all I can say is I don't know what happened yet but I Know that the people that have to to me said they stand the eating\nI don't know what happened yet but I Know that the people that I've talked to me said they didn't stand the emails and I believe him\nHow many letters are we talking about\nWe're talking about at least since I've I've talked to forgive truck lawmakers who say they haven't identified a single individual on the emails that came to them that says yes I sent that email a and we're talking Republicans and Democrats\nThey do uh I like that stories they do know now when I got quickly do we have time to talk about the city has seen in\nTells the story I wrote a column this week about a a a woman and her son who have to fit\nBowls and uh apparently one of them had gotten out once or twice and and see fixture fans I looked at the police report there was no\nNo no damage to anybody or anything but she thinks the fans Scott at taking care of and uh uh a couple of weeks ago\nThat dog was gathered in her yard but apparently that was long enough or he could jump over an animal control officer came over and here's where it's not clear because the city has provided\nA lot of paperwork yet at some point the two dogs that were in the yard got confiscated by CNN and were quarantined and the woman got a letter\nSaying a word checking your dogs there were or declaring them bat animals under ordinance and she was afraid that we're going to kill him so she got an attorney and attorney\nThat's been try to communicate with saying you know and say hey look I represent this woman in her dogs can you tell me what happened can you give me the police reports can you show me the justification for declaring that dog a bad animal\nThey won't get much in a way of documentation that says this is what happened and so he says I just didn't want to ... as the state law says the lawyer for the city for sale and says\nWell you can't just to me you got to protest to the animal control or so he goes to the city website\nThe animal control or doesn't exist on the city website I think the same thing I look for it I couldn't find it so we sent a letter to the mayor to the police chief who's in charge of the animal department to the cities attorney he does all of the things you would expect\nA reasonable person particularly in a journey to do in this situation\nThis attorney sends them a letter to say no you didn't do it right we're taking the dogs and that's what I got involved and I called the city attorney and all of a sudden the city attorney says well I don't know what a big deal is weren't going to get is taking care of nobody's killing any dogs but I asked him I said\nIf if if I have a dog problem in the ... me something and says I have a bad animal how do I caught check the animal control board this journey for the state may well I'm not sure that's not my department\nSo just this poor woman\nIs trying to everything right to protect our dogs and and and make sure that they argue it tonight and her attorney says look if the dog it's wrong just tell me what the dog so we can have a hearing about it and figure out what's going on the stage just not really very helpful in terms of sharing public information\nSo the dog the dogs are still alive and being being held onto like sitting on\nThe dogs are with their family right now um\nAnd uh and the city attorney told me that that he believes they're going to get it taken care of amicably that there's not going to be a problem but in the meantime as I pointed out if there really is\nAn animal control boards but it's the place that you seek a hearing if your dog gets declared dangerous or a bad animal spinach his responsibility to let people know\nHow they can contact that entity\nAnd some due process that's what the woman or a missile do any watched that's what the the attorney watch they just watch them your process if the dog gets something wrong let it average day in court\n[noise] Tony messenger there you go that's the latest and feel today dot com every Tuesday and Thursday

done but there there are hundreds of miles away from the U.S\nHow many ultimately make it to the doorstep and ask\nKnock on the door and ask for asylum we don't know yet we're still weeks away from that\nAnd and the argument\nThat they're just going to pour into the border with no that's not the way it works you can't just walk in like you can go to Illinois okay you just can't cross the river and all of a sudden\nYou have to seek asylum there are rules there are regulations there is nothing illegal about getting somebody getting to our shores and asking for asylum\nOr they are running out of a burning building they are seeking asylum if they do get to our border\nUm they are not invading our country\nWhat is interesting about this mic is this is that this Robert Bowers\nThis Robert Bowers who was saved\nHis life was saved by Jewish doctor moments after he ran into a a synagogue screaming kill all the Jews what's interesting is if his name was Robert Mohammed he would be called

back\nThe law says if you come to our short if you land on our land and you are seeking asylum the federal government will do a\nBackground check right and if it is proven that you are a seeking true asylum by whatever definition of the day is uh you are allowed into this country if you'd like to change that\nThere is a way to change that right I Am not\nHow can you say I Am for for paying for all of their health insurance I Want everyone to pay for their own health insurance that's why I think\n[laughter] that's why I like the Affordable CARE Act where they force people to buy their own health insurance so you're screaming at me because I Want to pay for their health insurance should pay for the immigrants health insurance\nWho should pay for themselves I agree so we can all agree that the Affordable CARE Act and the rule says we should all by on health insurance is a pretty good rule\n[noise] sorry John you in the big five fifty ... good morning John\nMoneymaker yeah just one reminder that would have a back in Nineteen eighty of the Mariel boatlift I'll read it for ... it was discovered that a number of refugees have been released from Cuban jails and mental health facilities [laughter] I haven't heard this yet but [noise] gotta feeling the same thing may be happening here as well\nBut but that's why they're vetted that's why they're there there are stories are taking it and they're processed that's the whole idea if there's a better way to do it let's come up with a better way I'm not sick but to insinuate that these migrant workers are invading America is ridiculous [noise]\nWell I said it was before the coming here to do the job we don't want to do\nThat is exactly right that's exactly right okay like things are a mark on the big five fifty ...\nHad a quick question regarding um you know that the immigration policy in the country [noise] um [noise] let's say that you're in a country that has a war of a war going here and you can't make it to the border um does that mean when should not have that country or shall we can help the people that get here\nWell we we we we relocated a lot of Bosnians to America during the Bosnian War right right so there were a lot of refugees and I I don't know exactly how that came about but a number of countries that will take a couple of the refugees and uh I Know there are a lot of people who were just a half a plastic over it\nBut I think it's um I think the St Louis could argue Twenty years later I think the community has added a nice flavor to saint Saint Louis um yeah but I\nI agree with that but but I guess my issue that I think the rest of the world should play a bigger portion I I agree that there's enough that they're not that America do more but I also like to see the rest of the world stepping up because there are so many that the conflict\nWill know when the president of Honduras is like personal friends with John Kelly the chief of staff so you think maybe they got an end to the White House you think maybe they could help solve the problem as opposed to have the the er the gangs and everybody run these people out of there are other countries they're fleeing a burning building\nAnd so if they get to our border at some point if they can actually get to our border hundreds of miles away and they show up and they say I'm running from my country I'm seeking asylum in this beacon of freedom please take me in and\nThey'll go through the process\nSo this is the process that has been in place this is what they do but we're really afraid of a bunch of mothers running out of a burning building with with strollers that's what we're afraid of it and if there are a couple of bad apples will find them will seek them out right if there are a couple of Russian botch in their\nRight well we'll do a better job than Twitter and Facebook will do finding them\nOr not a lot of people don't want to really admit why they're afraid of ... immigrant is just because the world is changing and they see their place in the world is changing also it's a fair I mean I I'm not sure\nWhat you can do about this lawyer blood ... and I thought the won't be better right now but I've seen that which gradually going backwards\nLook look the President Trump will look here here's the deal on immigration and I said it before yesterday and I'll say it again look Americans are not producing enough people\nTo continue our way of life\nWe don't have enough on skilled workers\nWe need workers talked to any business out there they can't find workers\nAnd I'm not talking about computer programmers though they have a hard time finding those people I'm Talking about workers who will put the roof son who will cut the yards who will pick the lettuce right who will pick the apples and so there was a massive problem in this country we need workers okay\nFine you don't want to bring 'em in okay then don't hire them\nIf they're here illegally and they crossed the Rio Grande and they write ... and ... all of a sudden the federal government gives out tax id numbers so that\nIllegal workers for a aliens however you want to call them can work in this country and still pay taxes\nThen get nothing on the back end okay so it's a nudge nudge wink wink we don't want to hear but if you're here while you're here we might as well employee you okay so this this snowflake idea that they're coming to invade our country is ridiculous\nBecause if homeowners were so upset they stop hiring illegal immigrants and you'd hire the American companies whose bids are significantly higher why because they are paying healthcare costs because they're paying taxes and it's shocking one voted to do your roof is ten thousand dollars another bit is five thousand dollars and you're wondering\nLet me go with the five thousand dollar bit do you think maybe there are a couple of illegals working there so the person who goes with the chief forbid is actually helping to cause the problem\nThey why why did the illegal immigration slow in the in the early Obama years because the economy was terrible and there weren't any jobs\nWho's hiring these these people\nSo let's not you know let's not oh my goodness how dare these people coming invade our country gifts\nWell let's not you know let's not oh my goodness how dare these people coming invade our country give me a break nine forty seven here big five
