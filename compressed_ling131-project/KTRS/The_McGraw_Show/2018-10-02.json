justice nominee and the two\nUh it's just a\nCoughing the of criticism\nAbout everything and anything to do with sexual harassment right it's like women who've been sexually harassed or all of a sudden they're speaking out and God love them let them speak out right that's the hashtag me do they feel empowered by other speaking out\nBut it's it they're like yelling at me\nFor having an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh I agree with everything everyone says about Brett Kavanaugh\nI agree and the positive I agree with the negative why because everyone's got a point that it's a legitimate point and I know it might sound Harvey Milk toast to have an opinion on everything but it's actually everyone's got a point and I see every one's point and everyone's point of view and I I agree that\nThat it is a valid concern\nAnd with that being said I still get yelled at\nYa okay now there is there is one\nThat might very much in my eyes disqualified Brett Kavanaugh from being sitting on the Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd this this came out I guess the last twenty four hours and what's that [noise] so you heard now that they they have some police report of him getting into a bar fight at a at Yale ... are now\nWell apparently\nHim and two of his buddies were coming back from a you'd be forty concert\nAnd then got into this bar fight afterwards and\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is you'd\nBe forty fan I knew that you have do you have to question you have to not a joke you have to question the man's judgment if you'd be forty fan you know\nNearly forty now is like\nComplete blast from the vast from college\nRed red wine was overplayed the minute it came out the second game out who would go and pay money to go listen to that song that that is questionable I question his judgment if he's a you'd be forty fan\nI'd like to question I sue serious judgment that this man can actually interpret the law correctly if he's a you'd be forty fan thank\nYou now that song is\nA ... going to join us\nA check roads will have the markets Mary Alice parks is in Manchester New Hampshire where Senator Flake just happened to find himself ... why would Senator Flake go up to new ... that is interesting ... or ... or it has\nThe a list of all the news that uh is Brett Kavanaugh\nTony messed are going to be on federal actually is going to be on and then there's a new book out which I'm brought was brought to our attention a couple of weeks ago from you have a chance to get the guy on\nHis new book is called the weaponization of social media\nExactly what it is\nThey have now weaponized social media to be a blunt instrument for someone's political point of view ... no longer you trading recipes and checking in with old high school friends and now ... telling you to do something that is and anatomically correct mhm mhm um so\nThe showing their muscle throughout the year with having Milwaukee's already won the division right now you know you got to possibly Chicago maybe being a second while I'll tell you what Jon Lester Nancy what you want about the guy even though we cheat sheet metal you know who you were\n... ... ... no no no he he got caught put Vaseline on the glove during the world series with the red Sox and the cardinals and he's the guy who can throw the first base but\nPlease sides that both sides that he gets paid a lot of money he's been a pretty good is so new to me there's been a pretty good free agent signing I'm probably one of the best ever feeling and the the young writer for the Dodgers ... outstanding yesterday was the one the other thank you uh do you call them\nLet's talk to or else has to be checking with him every Tuesday he is the Trump whisper and uh I Hope you're getting paid overtime ask us all on us because we are in some weird place in this country\nAt a theater that it would like we've never seen before if you wrote this up as a novel or a movie nobody believe is\nFirst of all President Trump didn't do his Supreme Court nominee pick any good to yesterday in that news conference talking about his drinking\n[noise] no no and that seems to be where the Democrats are going they don't seem to have much on the\nSexual assault for if they can't seem to corroborate any of the charges leveled against Kavanaugh so now how can they stop and well it's his credibility ah he didn't tell us about the seventh of beer that he drank\nThan so that seems to be where they're going [noise]\nUh it tells you that there's nothing that's going to satisfy the Democrats there's nothing the FBI is gonna come back with a lead a Democrat to say you know what we we have no corroborating evidence of this assault charges so we're going to let him go through [noise]\nWell I mean look there's nothing satisfies either party it doesn't matter what the FBI comes comes back with Republicans aren't going to leave him Democrats aren't going to trust him so I mean that's where we are we\nWe generally give the benefit of the doubt innocent till proven guilty or in these kind of matters because otherwise anybody could charge anything [laughter]\nAnd uh and the argument I think now wait a minute he didn't show traditional demeanor he was outraged by this terrible I think a lot of Americans look at this and saying wait a minute that's how I'd react if I was accused on justly and the Democrat position is will do outrageous things but you can't be outraged\nOil will burn you at the steak but you can't you have to whimper\nWe'll we'll make political attacks against you but if you respond while you're politicizing the process show I think the Democrats have not help themselves and this pressure I Will\nSay this depending on and mark my words ask us on us depending on how this plays out if Kavanaugh is confirmed and put in that helps the Democrats in the midterms\nYes he is ousted and has to be taken down or is voted out or whatever else that is going to rally the Republicans so really uh depending on winners if Kavanaugh wins or loses the opposite wins or loses in the midterms\nI think there is a good argument for that but I add something to it and that is that the Democrats are already showing cancer pink wave is so large that I don't think it can get any larger ... the Democrats are on fire and you can set fire on fire\nThe Republicans are the ones who lack the energy\nAnd so they were party and retreat and you could see that last week in the Senate hearings that Republicans are hiding behind a prosecutor scourge of female prosecutors courage they found their voice last week now we have a Republican Party we have some intensity and I think that's actually going to help Republicans either way now\nYeah it is a it is a interesting times in a Washington DC also it's a it's a it's a\nA house I don't know about you but it's it seems to be a national moments right this isn't just politics this has crossed over no matter where I go in town people stopping me who have never talked about the news and are talking about this story\nI think that's right this is a big moment because it's not just about a Supreme Court justice we're talking about the most powerful force on the planet sex gender we're talking about women's long march here to independence from gender from suffrage and the right to vote to the birth control pill to\nTo what they call now choice control over their own bodies there's something so big here and for a lot of women it is about stopping Donald Trump from taking women back\nThat's why this is such a big moment of a rural meeting around the water cooler\nNow Scott salons there was a good way thanks for checking in going to be with you\nAlso yesterday a Josh Hawley issued this story you had it in your news where five five thousand plus rape kits have been found untested\nThe kids have been found ... untested\nNot only that they also said that's how many they found there could be a lot more have not been tested\nYou want to know why women don't come forward\nWhich makes my head explode Everytime I hear this you want to know why they don't come forward because when they do go to the police\nAnd their rape kits aren't tested\nSo that's why they don't when you go and they don't match you imagine if you were sexually assaulted\nYou undergo yeah you know\nThe procedures in energy humiliated hair humiliating procedure of a rape kit right because you're violated again with this whole how they go and take the DNA and everything else\nRight now they really tried to\nI understand it but you have to sit there and I don't do this again right right in the medical setting where it's got to be extremely painful and everything else relive\nThe whole attack I'm only then to have it all collected and then sit on the shelf somewhere it's unreal it really is\nIt good it's it's unbelievable\nThe five thousand plus and they said\nThis is all we can find but we know there's more because of all the police departments out there nothing's coordinated so the chances of these other rape kits being in these other police departments is a very real deal huh [noise]\nWhile it [noise]\nThat's why women don't come forward it is it is\nIt could you imagine if your car was stolen and you called the police and they took the report and then they didn't do anything ... magic at the store was five thousand five thousand burglaries happened all over the last number of years and nobody ever do anything about it right you go and you investigate\nA robbery a police breaking a but you don't go and test a rape kit is just really\nIt's that's why women are so angry with one of the reason one of the reasons again again don't yell at me my one of the reasons one of the reasons frustration anger early much I have no absolutely it's it's no question about it it's it's when I heard that it was um\n[noise] it's staggering\nBut as a man you have to think to yourself wait a minute hold on a second\nYou're telling me the five thousand plus women went to the police and said I was abused I was raped I was a what I was here here let me subject myself to this task and then okay great thank you very much will get get back to you and not and they put it on a shelf and never do anything

billion dollars\nAnd and and so what they want the legislature to do next year is to make it harder for out of state of victims\nTo combine with in state victims in order to file the lawsuit cheer and so what happened is they started their campaign they've got this website up with with letters to Missouri lawmakers and you can go there and click on the ladder incentive to your ...\nAnd lots of state lawmakers are starting to get these letters from their constituents saying hey we really want you to change these laws we don't want these out of state trial lawyers coming into Missouri going after our businesses which isn't really what's happening but that's that's that's what those letters sake\nWell a couple of state lawmakers looked at 'em and they do their constituents praying wealthy keep photojournalist state you know they walk a doors in their state districts and and and knock on doors and they recognize some of the address doesn't make that I don't think these are real people\nAnd so they called me and I started walking uh uh some of the blocks in into our road south Peter married at the state representative represents that area got a bunch of these letters and I found a guy so\nClearly is on the list of saying he sent that letter and he said he didn't sound that letter and not only that you can do a little bit about the issue and he said no accent that letter

talk to them or call if you've got a cell phone he knows I'm ... and and he's one whole allegedly sent an email [laughter] and so what these lawmakers are telling me what appears to be the case and

because whether you're on the left or whether you're on the right you don't want to be able to influence your state lawmaker when you actually care about something that state lawmakers tell me and and and in this case\nThey they always have their legislative a tell me how many of those letters week God send a response to say thank you [laughter] they they they count up you know I got forty letters for a dirty letters against or whatever they pay attention to these things\nAnd now you're at state lawmakers and their legislative age being paid state you know taxpayer dollars\nHaving to take their time to address the emails and and now you're going to have that situation when they're going to be saying well he's clearly are real and those clearly are real and these might be real and how do I

on Tony along with Mike but this notion that people remember things\nPrecisely is not true Malcolm Gladwell got a whole podcast about how people don't remember nine eleven and a shame they have a whole study where they interviewed people every five years\nAnd they recorded them and they said where what happened on nine eleven all my gosh it's indelibly etched in mind I guess what every five years it was a different story so the notion that his grandmother remembered what she was wearing when JFK was shot maybe she was one of the few but it's just not\nWell no I Know we're all on everybody remembers exactly what they were wearing exactly what that doesn't mean it's true that is just how the ... remember it\nRight I mean his point is that she handled by the way I'm One of those ... female Republican to support capping off so I'm you know\nOn balance like when you're the one you or I Am I the only\nOne and uh so fortunate to live in this very open minded Jay I'm all of a say\nYeah the idea that people remember things exactly correctly is just not the case that it I thought it was just more a point of scientific fact [laughter] um but secondly Jeff Flake\nI have three points about this one Dianne Feinstein ... they they could have easily done an FBI investigation without anybody knowing\nAnything and it all could have happened between July thirtieth and September whatever\nCan they do it all the time I've been involved in some of this stuff and I've actually been investigated the FBI is incredibly good at what they do when it comes to this stuff and they do it quickly and they do it quietly and it could've been done point to Jeff Flake with counting the votes Mitch McConnell probably refused to do that\nJeff Flake probably thought oh my God this guy is going down\nAnd he ... he may have saved it or he may not have saved it but it's my guess he knew that it was going out as\nIf they do something you're saying that Jeff Flake saw Murkowski bones voting against cabinet and said let's try and save it with a one week FBI investigation\nI think that that is a real possibility because of what also could have happened after Feinstein didn't do her job was that the Republicans could have easily done their job between the time that the uh the doctor for came out to the Washington Post\nAnd when the committee hearings or that was like nine days my gas the FBI could have done the investigation and already had it hind to them\nBut I think flake was smart enough after those hearings to see what a jump ball it was and to get a sense in the country of oh my gosh there is so much just ... I mean you know the pink wave or whatever people are calling it\nI think he saw some writing on the wall and thought we've got to make this look like we at least\nTurned over every rock I give them credit for that do you and your name and shame\nOn Feinstein more than anybody but shame on like how for not seeing that who is somebody who clearly can the around the corner store\nAnd all of the I'm
