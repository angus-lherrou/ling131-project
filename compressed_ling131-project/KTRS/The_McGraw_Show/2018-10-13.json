exotic animals as well as our dogs and cats so ah I thought it'd be interesting to talk a little bit about uh the the uh some of the exotic animals that waste\nI thought it would be interesting to talk a little bit about uh the the er some of the exotic animals that we see\nAnd when we say exotic animals I mean I'm thinking I'm tigers and uh you know a a salt water fish or something or what is an exotic animal in a residential I'm just you know St Louis suburban animal hospital main\nSell a jelly you're talking about guinea pigs rabbit there it's a lot of different types of reptiles and birds\nOkay so uh I used to have a a lizard cool looking I don't know [laughter] so it wasn't a chameleon 'cause I think that those look a you know\nAnd dog trainer\nCan be ah can be helpful because they can have have corrective measures um but but ah auditory cues are and in body posture cues are huge in dogs it's a it's a last resort that a dog um you know physically ... reprimand another dog\nAnd let's be honest who owns a newspaper who gets the newspaper these days ah Larry let's go this route positive reinforcement and if you need to school the pet let's do it a lot of blame orally\nOr and yeah let's let's stay away from uh the nose is not because you know we're you know bleeding heart a over here\nUh about punishment but because it doesn't it doesn't work as well\nYeah you just need to get their attention to to direct their behavior and and like you said that it is an extreme measure\nFor a dog to physically punish another dog they will growl bark snarl way before they get to and bite or or any physical interactions so it it's like it would\nBe ... you know for for humans are touching and and physically interacting with each other is way more common so if somebody's bugging you yet you know you you you you know swat them on the shoulder you know or you know something like that have cut it out\nAnd we're accepting of that to dog that is like the equivalent of swatting them as like the idea of pulling out a gun at it's just yeah it is I was like whoa whoa why did you go that extreme weather that escalated quickly idea and then in in\nIn I guess the risk then is that you're teaching them to escalate things Chris quickly into um you know but but the the the\nThe dog behaviorists of have\nAll gone to the point where physical punishment is gone so the Caesar Milan\nWeirdos in the world that that meant\nThat promote physical punishment in these alpha dominance things is like research and in theory is that we're debunked in the seventies\nSo let's stop let's stop the old world kind of way of doing things and let's let's actually find out what the science says you know and and that's how we should proceed from now on I always say\nI'm about our our title sponsor Purina they've got scientists working in a lab you know twenty four hours a day maybe not twenty four hours a day so [laughter] they weren't really hard you know hoping they'll let them out for yeah in lab coats and they figured out what the best thing is to feed your dog and your cat\nSo why would you ever go with something else and why would you have well all you know I'll just give them a table scraps or\nNo I mean that's that's not what they need to send you give them a pro plan and it's got everything all their nutrients and all the vitamins and they're already so why are we wasting our time\nI'm so thank you Larry and uh I'm sure that uh it after a puppy grows out of the stage or maybe this won't even be a problem anymore yeah uh but that's a big puppy\nIs amazing and it's a big puppy a with us today Dr ... from the Webster groves animal hospital an urgent care center also Rachel Williams who is our exotic animal\nExpert of the day or she works over there at Webster Groves as well\nAnd we're going to chat her ear off a little bit about what an exotic animal is and and kind of how to treat those um so you are well versed in dogs and cats but we've also got some other uh you know\nC D E F G pets ... under your title is well let's answer ... question really quickly because this is sort of an interesting one morning Paul\nOkay the question is I think you know what it is [noise] is supposedly supposed to be sometimes my dog is dry on dogs to\nWhere he was maybe it's a cat's tail ... no no it's the dogs do [laughter] so what is the answer to that\nI I think I think it's a myth oh it is I think it's a misconception I mean\nThink I think it's a myth oh it is I think it's a misconception I mean\nThere there knows can be um warm if they're warm and cold if they're cold and and ah and doesn't necessarily correlate with any illness why is the dog's nose wet\nThe there is actually this is this is the crazy minutia that I get teased at at work because it has a ... veterinary just kind of stick in my brain and there is actually a gland within the knows\nThere's a gland in within those kind of like a a a tier gland within the I ... that there is a land inside the nose\nThat's regulated by the nervous system that that creates a kind of like tears theirs are created in the eyes it secrete moisture that keeps the noise mode ... knows moist and if you're dog's nose is particularly dried there's one on each each side\nAnd if you're dog's nose is particularly dry to the point that it's getting crusty and and that thick character and you know that you see on the on the side of those looks like there there's something growing officers\nDog's nose I'm I'm like a fungus or something growing up from their nose people will come in for that that can sometimes be\nA deficiency in that gland and and ah Josh you know you're you're thinking well ... what's the name of that land and yeah and I can't think of it right now a nose clean who's I Am yeah yeah you got Ninety ... Ninety percent of the way I guess if\nI think I should have just said is that an a name and no one else in on the phone and I think it's ... ... ... I Believe you\nBut I'll have to look it up and my and you can't it's hard to find in the anatomy books since it's on the outer edge of hacking of the nasal passage um but it it um\nBut uh it's hard to find in the anatomy books but that's a little bit of trivia than it to that I picked up somewhere\nWarmer than their way yeah okay uh well there's your answer Paul uh old wives' tale or in this case and old dog's tail a you're listening to the Purina animal advice showing the big five fifty ... we're going to go to a commercial break but when we come back\nWe'll chat up with our guest of the day Rachel William she is the exotic pet professional\nOver there at uh the the Webster Groves animal hospital an urgent care center what is your title what would you say a decade relieved OK okay Dr Williams yeah but I Would you say the exotic pet uh extraordinary\nEight okay I'm going I'm going to use that ... we will talk to her to find out what it is an exotic pet would be what what's under that umbrella and what are some of the strangest things\nThat have come into your office or over the years it has no question she ... the curator make talking to animals strange hours just will do a envy or does the arena make a lizard food I don't know we'll figure it out\nOn the other side of this break it's the Purina animal advice show on the big five fifty Katie RS\nIf you're one of those people who feel like your dog your part in the\nFamily you want to visit lucky dog bark and recreation ...

I've seen some rabbits live outdoors um and they get more rather kind of sensitive to weather related issues especially heat stroke type issues\nUm so you can't keep them inside I as a pet I probably would recommend that you do for sure\nI had a rabbit when I was a kid when I was when I was like in grade school at a rabbit named Thumper course Keith [laughter]\nI mean of course and I found out how to do when I get older the reason he was mean is because my parents didn't know that you needed to do to him\nYeah OK let's talk about that and he would just be seen by it and look at you and that rather than me so many times and then and then we went on vacation one year and they took him to a farm to live on the farm and what the other rabbit a dry air quotes yeah but I found out later when I was telling the story and I was like wait a minute\n[laughter] well it's all making has a half a and his parents you probably have had to do that to\nOne of the yeah I mean the ... the rabbit was biting me and I'm sure they were thinking we gotta we gotta get this rabbit away from this kid before child protective services come dressed in this hour which came first year the rabbit [laughter] so [noise] but if they would've known that I think if neutering him\nWould have made a difference I think I think so so number one do rabbits that were just live in our houses like a\nA cat or dog\nI think some people do that um it's definitely better advisable rabbits candy litter box trained but they do poop about a hundred and fifty little pellets per day\nOh my gosh we counted average and why I Do wonder my backyards full of rabbit\nBright exactly yeah and they also group at night to they do this special thing called ... which is night the that's a different kind of feces um\nWhich they actually have to eat in order to maintain their digestive health sounds like clean up after themselves or whatever they don't eat the date groups and other than a hundred and fifty [laughter]\nWow that is that is wild that's a lot of rabbit to 'em so when\nSomeone brings a rabbit or you know you've you and there's got to be a difference between wild rabbits and pet rabbits right\nUm I mean may not anatomically but stress level wise I'm sure that wild rabbits\nAre into new may get a feral cat\nAnd wow that is we really don't see just because there's regulations on treating I'm native Missouri wildlife\nSo if we had somebody called out something like that we're probably going to refer them to the um wildlife center over in Baldwin mhm um because they have a special wildlife rescue or type stuff they\nDrew a but rabbits get neutered just like anything\nElse to do yet and stayed um many actually do that again will surgery once a month easily on a second to this day and that can be you know rabbits bays new voters um\nOur schedule home one day a month and just get back to back yeah ...\nYeah I wouldn't say there's a huge demand for it to do it more than one day a month so that's why we do it on that day um but yeah we do end up usually having several interesting things to do\nAnd then a birds [noise] um I don't generally to someone else in the office the bird person\nNo I mean I'll see them they don't generally do bird surgery we usually refer them to live on that um that specializes in birds out in Chesterfield\n'cause I Know that birds are probably what would you say you've got your dog your cap and then as far as a household pet goes what's next [noise] um I guess it depends\nA lot of people ... and if there's kids in the ... yeah that's a big one yeah a lot of people have birds but they are a very big commitment and especially the larger bird like my causing cockatoos because those guys can live well sixty eighty years\n... I'm Sorry sorry you say sixty to eighty years and yeah and they're taking care of properly and we're the thirty year old and you get a a cockatoo moves that things out labor hit might yeah yeah exactly so people that have to put their birds in there and they're well I'm taking care of after they pass\nTo birds go great uh I don't think so I think are so little bird kind of looks like a younger\nYeah except you know they may have some center damage if they've got you know further piping issues or weight loss things like\nThat or a we are going to go to another commercial break it's the Purina animal advice show we have a special treat today Dr ...
