United States a foreign policy at all it's been mixed on that front we've had\nA we've been advocates certainly for liberalism and human rights but also has to make do with\nA dictators and death bought some compromise on a secure on a human rights I think sometimes in a situation where he didn't have to what we thought you know the countries the south America and so forth worth eight are being taken over I mean\nWe had to put up with murder murder its\nRulers uh I think we have more ability to advocate for human rights that that people acknowledge because we're pretty safe for the United states right actually very dependent on on uh people like the Saudis contrary to a lot of conventional was\nBut it seems like the administration as much friendlier to the Saudis than they are to say the Canadians and or to do up in Canada he's been much more harsh and his rhetoric towards judo then he adds towards\nThe crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nYeah absolutely I think it's an embarrassment I I think that the uh the sword dance that ah the Trump cabinet official did when they went over there the beginning of the Trump Administration of President Trump's early trip to Saudi Arabia or we're sort of\nEmbarrassment said Mike Pompeo's trip the other day where he's smiling and laughing with the crown prince a on film a should embarrass him a because even if you think we have to do business the Saudis we don't have to treat them as if we're sort of the vessel visiting decaying and\nThe kind of bow down before the end their oil wealth it's it's sort of a soft and honestly so uh I think we we can give them a hundred times we don't have to turn them into our enemy we just don't have to sell them as many uh weapons at the end help the tropic wars in Yemen\nAnd a treat them as as close allies rather than uh just another country that we'd like to see behave better\nThat Hillary Clinton got into a lot of criticism for some Saudi princes giving money to the Clinton\nFoundation during the administration now we're starting to look a little bit harder at Donald Trump's dealings with the Saudis in the financial dealings sees that over the last Twenty years since the compromise will he be able to sort of put what's in the best interests of America First as opposed to his own interests\nLike this is another example a stop to own one where we have to ask uh what affect the flow of money into his business ... business is having on his foreign policy decisions\nUh or the path that meant that he got before he was president and uh I think if there is no political pressure on him he's likely to ah to\nGive up on you know maintaining a actually a lucrative flows of money into his hotels the Saudis if it provided a but\nHe yeah he I think in some ways he's compromised at least there the appearance of compromise which is why it's such a shame\nThat he became president didn't ask themselves but he says it's a map of conflict of interest\nThat you're
