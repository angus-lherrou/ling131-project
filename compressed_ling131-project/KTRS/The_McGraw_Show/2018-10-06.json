like that but but um he likes data no you know veterinarians data alive but but I'm going to try to stay away from some actual data data but anecdotal anecdotal evidence yes but it's um\n[noise] it's it's it's\nPeople who don't have animals don't necessarily understand as much as people who do have animals about you know this this constant companionship this unconditional love that animals provide for you\nIf you're lonely you're not lonely because you've got an animal\nGet part of your family they it's it's just it's um you know they have shown and you've obviously there have been service dogs\nForever and a day helping people with\nNo physical disability they you know seeing eye dogs I'm ... but now you're seeing more more for um emotional support dog and the poor dogs that are um that are used for people who have some emotional issues um anxiety pie TST I'm\nBipolar disorder schizophrenia is all the things that they're you're seeing you know animals that are are there for for not just the physical disability is that people who have mental disabilities and it it it reduces their their stress levels and helps them cope and and there's there's so much\nMore to that relationship between animals and people that that you never even people even think about you know\nUm that that you hope that you can have\nA relationship like that with a person but but you really they they've shown that that dogs actually can almost be have the same support systems and support as as humans do with their human support [noise] so uh it was a lot of\nThings that you just said right there are there are I'm jotting down my notes of things to ask\nBecause um\n[noise] I mean yeah pets are great but there are some you know kind of rules or come there's there are some\nSome downsides to some of these things to having such a strong bond with your pet what about separation anxiety yes which my sister's dogs have um you know and how does that developing and how do we treat that\nUh pets as um service animals\nA fantastic idea pets ah to give to people with emotional disabilities or or pets to give to a you know people who\nHave lost a spouse when they're older I'm a great idea however we've chatted on this show do not just give your mom or your dad or your grandma or your grandpa a pet just because they lost their spouse has totally I mean\nAnd Paul ... just because they lost their spouse has totally I mean a pet is a responsibility\nIt is a responsibility and mutual relationship you know a\nCat is much easier to deal with because they don't really care that you're actually there was all the food of but you know you give mom or dad a dog\nA and and now they're strapped to taking care of a dog that they didn't know was coming for the next you know how many years the thing and the Fifteen Years mhm so you know that might actually be more of a burden\nWould have ... would've mom wanted to travel now or or the trees retire right on things so right or that is something that you don't want\nTo do a grade a grade um that you know that that that quick judgment of oh I was going to go grab an animal and have you know have something to give to somebody for a for emotional support is definitely not the way to go absolutely not um I think it's something that really does require a lot of\nOf talking talking and I'm\nObviously you know service dogs dogs that are specifically trained and go through of\nVery strenuous a very extensive amount of training to be able to do this like a year's time more than more than and you know the amount of money that it costs for for the support ducks these ... you know support dogs dogs that are going to help with people with specific\nDisabilities um are trained specifically for that particular person and so they've been invested that time and then and money to be able to say it is a\nOf the huge undertaking and it's not you know things like that or are they they they have a good portion of money for things like that you know for emotional support ducks right now there is this the ... you see everybody has you seeing people walking around with their emotional support docks everywhere and there's this this\nQuestion or this confusion of\nCourse the difference between a therapy dog slash emotional support Dodd's versus a service dog and and you know what animals are allowed to to be in restaurants and other facilities and what animals aren't allowed to be in those facilities and you know what what kind of laws are are\nThere to help to their you know airplanes you know\nI'm In you know these emotional support dogs that a lot of people are getting which is great I I fully support that um those dogs are not necessarily\nSpecifically trained and so those dogs and and the the people that own those dogs are not supported by the American ... either so so those talks enforced they're not required to have to be placed you know go into restaurants and things and restaurant owners don't have to\nLet them in ... and we're a service dogs who are who are trained to actually have you know the years years and years of of ...\nUm those handlers are actually supported by the American disability act and so they can go wherever those people are going you know and there's a lot of um\nQuestions or you know anger about ... what are ... concerns about who's allowed to go into places and his not and what's what's a service dog versus an emotional support dog or a therapy dog and um it you see the animals all over the place because there there are there to help\nYou know support those people and uh it it's it's hard to people try to\nTry to use their dogs as emotional support docks or say that their emotional support docks but yet they're not you know people are getting vast so they can go and take them into public places even though they don't have the free allowing a Haitian if anyone\nCan get that on line exactly so that's kind of ... um I don't want to um\nYou know in a great anyone or or throw anyone under the bus here uh because it's a very serious issues with mental health Tuesdays uh but we were in an airport in Florida and there was a woman with food to support dog and it was a you know little\nFluffy Pomeranian with the best on but it also had a two two and Neal's were painted and I was just trying to think to myself um is is real or is this you know someone who\nYou know I I'm sure that the dog helped yeah women idling emotional ... helped this woman that but how much like you said how much training yeah to that you know Pomeranian go\nThrough which is why you know there are certain there are some states who have different rules for for what they allow for emotional support stocks but but you always have your economy does your dog\nCan your regular dog become your emotional support dog\nAs well ... ... out any training without training yes I mean they they have to they start you still has to eat you know not to be labeled an emotional support I get your doctor does have to you know diagnose you with the most or something but these dogs don't require any training and so you know\nYou're you do on the rescue people walk up to dogs all the time because of that um that bond you try you want to pet them you want to play with them you want to talk to them you want to and any dog that is on any sort of work\nRelated something you should not be touching them playing with them distracting them from there from their jobs\nTrying to play fetch without seeing eye dog and\nYou know these dogs that are emotional support ducks because they haven't had a lot of training or they may not have had any training they could they could\nShow aggression they give you know they don't you see you got to be careful but um you know you see is fantastic to see people using the as the animals for for their own emotional support because it it does it it has shown\nYou know reduction in anxiety reduction I mean people kids with autism I mean shoot they they know it helps with them you know interacting in communicating with with people and and\nAnd it's it's amazing that that relationship that they have that you have to be careful with the animals that you do see out and about who are these you know is a support dogs or service dogs or emotional support talks all of these dogs should not be\nHandled [noise] you know you you you can't help yourself you want to go over there and talk to them and\nDamned dog in the world I Want to put the ... and ... it was like um but we can't and yet and that's because these dogs or beer for ... I mean especially people with vision of ... a bats\nThat person's eyes right so if if they're extracted eyes are looking at you get to your waving you know a bacon bits while they're trying to cross the\nBorder yeah that's that's not a not a good\nOr so I mean I Know that that's an extreme example as they are having the dog while he's at work on assignment as is also a out of the question we're going to go to a commercial break but let me give up the phone number is again nine six throwing Katie Orr is nine six nine five eight seven seven we\n\nKind of track down an owner and turn them into the authorities\nYes slicker not very often but I mean that's that's one of the reasons why I'm here is is I'm an advocate for our pets and some of the some of the things that happen I've seen certainly are because of just not people not knowing some of it is just\nNot having the knowledge the know how to be able to care for their ... a little bit about your lack of of understanding by some of the engine to find out you\nKnow people going online and taking the advice of Internet streams yes\nBut some of it is is blatantly obvious in cruelty and so yes I have threatened and I have of and I have reported because that is that that's my job again as I Am the advocate of the animal and I am here to to make sure that we do no harm in and that is the animals are taking care of\nAnd when when patients come to see you you're seeing the animal that's your patient and we just happen to be the you know flashy substance that\nDream well three quarters of my job honestly as as education I kind of consider myself almost like a teacher\nSo a lot of a lot of interactions that I have is more honestly what what the people trying to say about about the path to yeah so ... that number one priority that ... that is number one priority at swimming\nAnd how we get people to start doing the right thing that comes in the education department director uh Dan is on line one morning damn\nGood question I got a seven year old show issues about forty I'm forty one and should actually got my every morning and I know that's got to know the spring of poppy\nSeeds and all of them and it's got everything everything got everything on it\nSo I'm just you know like I said I should be overly concerned about that I'm a show about like that I mean\nShe just she just got the top of the ... of the everything bagel\nIf you're in the bottom that would have been better because\nYou're right there's not as much stuff on there [laughter] um that amount is probably not going to be a huge issue even with the garlic that's on their et cetera it's a very small amount for a pound dogs so or or was there for parents are like is also bad for our pets okay that\nAre so Dan it sounds like you're going to be okay but ah keep listening because I've got some questions for the doctor\nAbout your bagel shop now there are people who test positive false positives for opioid as they eat poppy seed muffins and maybe every day or every other day I I\nDon't know um I mean just just because you were testing doesn't mean that these people are getting you know strung out on poppy seed muffins is just in the system ... when our pets eat poppy seeds you know they're not getting any sort of\nOpioid kind of effect from it ah and I mean of poppy seeds you take out the everything bagel was a poppy seed bagel or would that be anything to be worried about\nProbably not I'm not I mean if it ate an entire bag of poppy seed bagels that would probably be something I have to probably all in and see if\nThere isn't it human Idaho bag someone sitting there would probably be back but probably not a alright well let's move on to the garlic portion of my question uh who knew garlic was bad\nI'm Glad you well garlic garlic has a similar um response to what onions due to dogs onions or read to me to Penn\nSo onions I'm paying high as ... issues um it actually changes the integrity of the red blood cells actually causes the body to then destroy those red blood cells that causes anemia garlic can do this similar things\nAre these large quantities or like I Know that we've talked about grapes and raisins that any amount of grapes and raisins\nThese kind of does dependent so it would be something that we would have to probably do some calculations maybe even ... call poison control and see but but I say you know if if a dog if you let's say you had a\nYou know stir fry or something and you drop those small piece of on the on the floor I'm probably not going to freak out but if your dog and a half and I'm In I'm going to probably be not very happy and we're going to induce vomiting and we're gonna we're gonna you know we need to treat that South\nWho knew All right Dan that was a a my portion of the question and hopefully a that is reassured you that you should be okay for the okay but keep on the list of of grapes and raisins which are essentially the same thing a just a different stage of life or grapes and raisins\nUm onions and garlic onions and garlic chocolate mhm and the the darker the chocolate the worse right correct they close the worst Baker's Chocolate is the worst and last but not least a gum or candies with little\nCart and peanut butter now is that it's all it's all open Unabomber's made was ... he had to be careful so I'm about as you're getting your ...\nWhen I say it's all I mean the sugar kind of touch food we're gum or whatever\nThat's all I mean does sugar kind of touch food yet we're gum or whatever and that's the big sugar substitute uh All right thank you Dan Ga is on the phone the morning Jay\nMartin was shot\nYeah so we've got the sugar free something on your gum or your peanut butter or whatever to give it to you don't work clarify that ...\nIs what you're looking for him at\nAll with an axe at all I\n\nThink you'll ... what kind of cereal was in the bowl guided\nBy real watch the New York correlation\n\nI\nCaught\nI ever since the sixties but I Am curious or do you\nWant to run\nThe situation you're trapped by\nThe dog would most likely would probably be treated\nYou know for\nSure so I'm assuming you mean like the the cartoon\nA fair trial I Would say is certainly if an animal got caught in a trap depending upon what part of the body got trapped I mean right now I mean certainly if it was a leg amputations is always a feasible option if the leg was not something that was salvageable\nWhat is life like for a dog with three legs\nOh it's fantastic animals can do a fantastically with three legs I mean if they can read her legs to deal with that most of the time they can run just as fast as it is for ...\nA dog on like rip ... believe it or not to ... it's amazing the front and one in the back up one on each side fan and he runs like\nUh it's amazing how many animals can do with with three legs so if if you're ever your animal ever has to have a leg amputations they actually really do a fantastic job and there are lots of\nUm testimonials and videos and things that you can find on the Internet to show dogs who are tripod than they do they do fantastically in terms of traps obviously they're they're a traps now that they make that are are definitely much more safe to trap animals with that or not\nYou know they they don't get injured west and so um live traps and things like that for when we're trying to trap cats who are strain their animals who are who are strays and we're trying to get them out of out of harm's way and uh and the\nBustle and flow of of of the\nWorld we we used traps that they use traps that are that are meant to be just containing containing traps and not once that that new ... New York you know\nUh it everybody always talks about all the good old back in the good old days when you stop and think about it are the good old days with these\nHorrific looking bear traps and um you know oh my ... dog a little lame a better put her down and it puts a motor oil on it yeah like when you think it's the wild west or something\nWell and this is this is the difference said that from ... years ago has and the difference now between ... human animal bond to the you know they've they've shown that the animals you know the dogs are not spending three quarters of their time outside anymore out in a shed they're there in the bed with the owners they're in the house at the unrest there part of their family now and so um\nAt nine AM when the Saturday morning schedule gets

segment that sponsored this weekend every week every favorite folks\nCoventry health care of Missouri at the company well you know what your requests for college has just the callers have come through thank you as soon as we have Jay on line one to kick it off he has a question about Social Security wonderful\nGuy I'm On the thirty five I have a question a friend of mine and I have a philosophical debate going a little bit but but it's also\nMore relevant for me because I'm I think I Am a show on the retirement\nSituation and a couple of months but anyway my\nFriend is saying that he thinks the obviously and I know it is\nYou grow at at eight percent a year every year you wait pasture far and I'm\nI'm ready then and I don't know about his medical insurance but for eight sided he's not gonna take it I Know I've got to have a solid pension and I think\nI might go ahead and the next month or so and um and for that and for the start of Social Security\nI'm up to ... percent increase now two years past that far away so I got a question on which philosophy like butter or do you think should I be\nStarting the Social Security\nSo I don't want to say you were about to talk about health care\nUm I'm eligible for dry here I did twenty plus in the military so I don't have to do anything on that front um with Medicare I Believe just want to return from that and oh what about by that I could by that time and that to my pension plan and\nI Know I'm going to be a lot of different things how how ... how is the best way to to evaluate buyback which by the way we are now because of\nTime and interest or a pretty have built up a pretty significant amounts of money to have to buy a service time so those are my three or whatever question\nI served his time in my three or whatever questions second\nGrade takes shape well I think I Will I'll pick it off and starting with the Medicare question because that's an easy answer which is please do not do anything do not add a Medicare Advantage plan or a supplement to your try care because what happens is it will turn your ... off\nLuckily you have a veteran benefits through the VA what your try care so you do not have to add any other policies and most specifically do not add a Medicare Advantage plan because what that does is it replaces you're try care so you don't want to do that [noise]\nSo it's good that it's probably smart idea [noise] um the other question I guess he had a couple of other questions one was about uh about taking Social Security now waiting until somebody I think that's I think it's kind of interesting the problem that we have with the answering the question is\nWe really don't have a lot of information we don't know if he's married or single\nUm if he was single I Would certainly say probably makes sense to take because you're not really trying to build it up later for someone else as a survivor benefits\nBecause the idea behind waiting is one to build a survivor benefit but also the amortization of your Social Security benefit and basically what the government has done is that if you take it early you're ... you're ... you're you're increasing the length of the payments\nThat Social Security is going to be making too so they give you less annually you wait you're going to be taking it over a shorter period of time so they give you more there's a Seventeen year break even on that so you so it really becomes a very personal decision as to if you're taking it earlier waiting\nYou know this kind of interesting also in that um she could have taken\nBenefits two years ago when he hit normal retirement age my question would be um or their debts out there that should be dealt with um moves away too you know maybe a mortgage here who else did you get rid of that is not um why wouldn't you take the benefits right away especially if you have a pension would absolutely\nBe I don't really have enough information on the\nLine in terms of the buyback of the benefits I Would I Would have to say that it's a difficult question to answer only because we're not sure about what you talked about a year or early which is\nWhat you're volt I mean how much liquid cash or do you have available to you know in retirement assets\nWere liquidity purposes or of all your money tied up in either G S P plans or ... plants et cetera having that having a lot of liquid cash reveal to you liquid assets even if they are I'm already\nBuilt in on retirement investments there's really a pretty good things so I don't know if it makes sense for him to walk more money off um to get to increase his pension benefit especially if you don't need it\nSo that makes sense to me it sounds like\nShe might be a candidate to speak with an advisor because he has a lot of questions with that that span of variety of topics it's a perfect time to sit down with someone and kind of lay out what your plan is in retirement\nYou I think it would be real important gene I Would certainly recommend the same thing if you're working with your laws were things time to really kind of way out the algebra here\nYou know how much would you receiving were periods of time how to fix it how does this fit into your game plan you know we love to do that or office on our big electronics exploited for white Gordon\nUm we like to say we like to play this is your wife for that is right then it's a lot of fun because we can lay out the various options that are there for you and then frankly it sounds like you're in a situation where you have a lot of good decisions to make\nUm obviously those were the ones you make today are going to be in a moment based on your situation but making sure we will work for\nI think that's really where it is so I'm ... thanks for calling this morning's chicken us offered\nYes we do thank you Jay and now we also have Cathy on line to Social Security question from her acts to morning Cathy\nIn under four you still talking to your ex Jeff years us about your ex\nNo I'm not talking or some shit\nI Am thinking about thinking about retirement next year because of the hassle retirement age of sixty six [noise] I was married for him um over ten years [noise]\nAnd I wanted to see if I could glass our sense\nOf security is that um mine which was the guy with a [noise] I guess I Would be\nAble to collect path ahead says\nSet of mine but my understanding of themselves as dirty lately what they told me was half of his is less than my full amount that I Would take off of mine said and I couldn't go with his\nShow caffeine I Believe were you born before January first Nineteen fifty four\nThat would bar in February Nineteen eighty three okay\nThat's what that's what I thought the math was so you are still eligible to discuss this with Social Security\nWhen you reach your full retirement age or also called normal retirement age\nYou you can collect fifty percent of your ex husband benefit and then allow your benefit to continue to grow until you reached Seventy or until the your full retirement benefit is more than fifty percent\nOf your accent benefit you still have access to this because the rules change for every one that was born after January first Nineteen fifty four\nOh okay so you might want to when you're talking to Social Security ... you might want to clarify with them when you were born I don't know if they had taken all that information from you but generally when they're speaking to people now they're using what the new regulations are which wouldn't allow for you to do that\nOkay of that I could sell collect a off the head even though it's less in line and satellites are seven day our cell life that if this is more than what I'm getting from ... says that really um [noise]\nThat's right I think what they've done is they've said they want to really listen to their members\nWhat people need and what benefits people really want to see improved and they're making the effort to make those changes United healthcare in essence still offer excellent benefits and will be discussing them in the upcoming weeks because we have several clients utilizing those policies as well\nBut this is a nice option for individuals who are using the traditional supplement want to try out a Medicare Advantage plan without a lot of risk to them see how it works and if they like it they get to stay and if not they get to go back without any penalty\nAnd it's interesting because many of folks I Know that you've talked to in the past um [noise]\nYou know either they've heard it across the river from the water cooler from friends or whatever that you know Medicare Advantage plans weren't so great but\nFor those folks that some of them which is ... even if their physicians were covered in the work that smells like this was a great way for them to transition and once they find out that there are always seeing their doctors anywhere reversed you want to make the next move to the to the ...\nThey get to reduce their liability even further\nWhich is which is awesome and we're really I'm Talking about this thing with a referrals because you know we use the word ... most folks that are that are thinking about a ... really eligible for these plants\nIt really goes back to the beginnings of um community here is it was very restrictive and networks were small you have this you have to call and you give you had to get a hearing ... refer to get it from your primary ended up paying a copay before you see a specialist it really doesn't work like that anymore does\nIt does not um United healthcare several years ago to develop the what was called the open access HMO and basically what that did was open the doors for more than multiple hospital systems and multiple physician groups to join different HMO style plans\nAnd really give the participants more choice in their in their position networks\nWhat it also did was as technology has developed over time these Medicare Advantage plans do not require with HMOs style do not require that you go into your primary have them check you out get the referral wretched and then you take it to the specialist you just call the primary and say hey I'd like to go see\nWhomever they electronically generate the referral for you it shows up at the specialist office you call it make an appointment with your specialist you don't have to see the primary\nThey're legally required to give you as many referrals if you want to as many physicians as you want you can't be restricted\nSo it's really quite different and really what it does is it mirrors how people utilize health care\nAnyway when you go into the your primary and you have your blood work done and they say oh Mr Smith I think maybe it's time that you take a look you might see a cardiologist you don't say okay I'm going to go home and look went up in the phone book you say well you know primary who do you suggest\nThey make they make a suggestion to you that that is like a referral you're just not completing the full process which would be walking out to the nurse in saying hey could you please make the referral for me Dr Smith recommended this cardiologist\nThey would do that for you like tropical you send it over to the specialists\nAn ad that individual becomes your new one of your new physician manually you just call the primary and say hey I Need my referral and set up again to see my cardiologist and they'll do it electronically no questions asked show it really is pretty simple but if you're not ready for that to\nTry it out the PPOs a great ... great alternative ah we have now the phone lines are just lighting up with pat has been so patiently holding on line one she has a Social Security question\nTo morning mining itself\nHealth insurance question too sure okay I worked thirty four years for the federal government I retired in Nineteen Ninety four one day after my birthday and I was\nTwelve years part time in order to get Social Security okay I only get one third of what I paid for Social Security I started out at sixteen dollars a month I'm now up to a hundred and three by\nMy insurance is a hundred and thirty four dollars a month for part the so I have to pay the difference right okay\nI was married for Nineteen years [noise] but I made more money than my ex husband is from him\nSo my question is I Am very secondary insurance through the government LOU LOU shale\nWhich is cheap but it goes up every year so next year it'll be a hundred and sixty seven I started at Seventy two dollars a month so I'm just wondering if maybe I should switch I urge Coventry friends are going to come and\nSo I'm from if I get out of Blue Cross Blue Shield you can't ... I can never go back I can never go back\nShores do what my recommendation would be as that sounds like you are a prime candidates to for to have a review of your health insurance benefits you what we want to take a look at what a hundred and sixty seven dollars a month and buying names for Blue Cross Blue Shield\nAnd what the alternative options could be through a Medicare Advantage plan it may be kind of a tree or maybe one or the other plans for you well\nYou better and has a equal or benefits that are going to match what you need so I Would suggest 'em sit a scheduling some time to sit down with someone like myself to review those choices because like you said this is a big decision for you because\nYou can't get back into your old benefits but if you find something you like better you'll never want to go back so you want to make sure that you um have a nice good clarity on what you're doing before you make the jump\nTo make an appointment with you and I was with your father vestments which wasn't very much because I don't have much but anyway I Would like to sit with you and have you with me because\nI was kind of switched two years ago in the last minute I backed up because we share with the government is a very good insurance okay I'm a ... covers everything with a doctor no no no no hospital bill the only thing I've ever had a friend that phrase\nThe only thing I've ever met for Sam\n... well that we would love to see you in the office anytime before December seventh to make that could potentially talked about making that switch\nWell pad against thank you so much and you know it's easy for you to get a hold of us if you like uh just give us a call through one for each six three zero zero zero eight or send us an email ... calm as we already have your do\nWe did at least right now we have Bob he's on line three and he had a question about the economic climate right now the wording Bob\nAnd good morning we know that's\nThe worst\nIs Marty and ask you that hey wonderful economic fighting in\nDenver [noise] can drive on the findings changes or what is the market [noise]\nWell Bob I'll tell you\nI guess from a from a political point of view you would you would wonder what would be bad or if the if the Republicans lose the house of representatives which you know which is up in the air at this point it would probably create gridlock obviously just like we saw in the last ... with the Obama years\nIf the Republicans lost the Senate in the house and um I don't know it might be fun to be watching TV again because we certainly will see a shootout\nBetween the president began incoming call\nI guess we do you have anybody I Can't believe anybody would costs us or at\nThe house that's nice sorry I got to go to St Louis calls that a weird way he'll needed are deaf folks like illegal Katie are asked if he actually want to talk to the coach on on the air cell phone\nExactly I Can't believe somebody got my super super cell phone number anyways but um you know I think what we really need to do is take a look at really what the underlying economics or a what's happening is is that we're seeing trade the trade deals starting to get renewed\nWe but surely which is very positive thing you know unemployment is down to three point seven percent or ... I Would say that I'm at this point a recession is really nowhere in sight because the economic group\nYou know the bottom line is is that this last week was certainly emotional thing for everybody in terms of the you know the Kavanaugh hearings and getting hopefully by the but sometimes depending on your viewpoint he's a he's probably going to go on to become one of the Supreme Court justices Supreme Court so the truth is we always have stuff going on\nYou know shake up in the bond market at the end of the week that cause some pull back right in the financial on that and the equity side of the market\nYeah we've seen interest rates to I mean industries have gone up the real question becomes are they going to raise rates are going to quickly the truth is nobody knows\nSo that's why I think the important thing here is to do two things and you know that this is what we do for you as well for other clients number one is is that\nWe like to make sure that the income that our clients are needing to maintain their lifestyle the cash flow that we're providing them through their retirement or retirement plans were always keeping six months in reserve\nThey're living on cell phones near the bed and I voted for him to work with one or Ninety six six thirty three twenty five\nLiving in\nYour ashtray Louis [noise]\nWhy don't you only have our church they don't make much safer but it's interesting move on dot com [noise] take real buckle down challenge [noise]\nWe're\nWe're getting ready for the first as the the steps of the season for the tigers south\nKicking off a little after ... am our time hello again are Bradford August Mayfield engineer here in Columbia, Missouri Jackson Weaver running thing at all your field headquarters we're going to get up to the minute the Williams ...\nCoach very old I'm at a bit we'll start off with the voice of the tigers Kelly and went to show that was available we will hear from him and of course you know like how are you this morning I'm well Brett how are you today doing alright Joe goodbye we [noise]\nYes yes indeed yeah went to a actually went up to Chicago and fraud and watch the cardinals because I'm ... so [noise] but it was a great deal so talking about trying to get healthy that's normally the theme for these teams on these by week's coach showed him saying it was like a manual\nYou know normally the theme for these teams on these by week's coach showed up and saying I was like a manual hall ... brown right off a lot better place anyway and they work with a lot to get in Georgia a couple of weeks ago health like Jonathan job that appears to be healthier too so I'm getting at least the receivers that have better better spot I think that could help the tigers today\nWell we'll see right at the end of the day you know woman officer so football it's about execution then\nYou're going to have to really do a good job of protecting a ... a blend consistently has has protected drew walk over the course of the last couple of seasons and of course you know certainly into the ... the woman giving up three stacks but\nYou know ... the hurry used it to you know when they forced him out of pocket and things like that so can you protect the quarterback that leads the execution in at the end of the day\nYou know the receivers are only obviously one part of their offerings you're going to be able to run the football and let's see if Missouri can establish because\nLike any SEC game particularly against the teams that are the best teams in this tune in each division really comes down to you know you're going to be able to to to make some movement of wind a scrimmage him to try to control that\nThe tigers like Kelly with us on the ... tiger tailgate head coach Barry Odom joining us momentarily so that the big into request and the ... over this game overall\nSouth Carolina's quarterback situation Jake that lean normally to start or not at a hundred percent right now Michael scar neck he would likely be the next guy up what are you hearing about that later right now well\nJust whether you're reading the paper and a yesterday there was a report that said that would be ... and this morning a man was kind of backed off a little bit into the game time decision I think it'd be a good thing but you know you have to prepare for all three because you know according to a\nUm you know what you read in the newspaper the ah I'm Caroline also had their young Frenchman quarterback that was taking snatched with the the first name as well he's more of a runner and the other two guys I just think you have to be aware of you know the possibility of maybe seen three guys do\nThat I think a lot of folks are a little disappointed with South Carolina sitting at two and two right now but those losses are against the capital undefeated teams Georgia and Kentucky where do you think the game talks are right now relative to where I think a lot of people believe they would be back in August I'm a I think\nProbably the one that the surprise most people was that was the way the Kentucky jumped on them last week and um you know and that was a game in which Carolyn had a lot a lot of penalties they also lost their poise on multiple occasions\nUm so I you know I think if you just look at a going in the folks from Carolina will tell you what we should warn games in reality they lost to butter Georgia team do you just simply manhandled here\nUm you know in Columbia South Carolina wants to a really good Kentucky team and I keep telling people don't sleep on march to stimulate the six years a news program we've seen each of the last couple years were that team is starting to get mental we'd better athletes but starting to\nTo to really do things differently in terms of the culture that they're building there in Lexington so um you know he wants to Kentucky team it was better than they were so um you know I I think Caroline is exactly where they probably should be tuned to\nThe tigers Kelly with us on the arrive alive tiger tailgate\nThe FCC announced this week commissioner Greg thank you need to get a contract extension to twenty twenty three and that reminded me that that you and the other play by play guys and the conference had a chance to add a a private ... back in the pre season and for the thing that popped out it you guys get into ways to improve fan experience any kind of take us inside that conversation about\nOh yeah and you know first of all congratulations to ... can you use a terrific administrator has done a fantastic job um with this conference is well respected by everyone did he come into contact with and so there's no question but ah he was very very deserving of that of the race looks good on a cruise your being with\nVery old OK guys thanks very much coach showed him good to see it early kicked off but heck after a by lake let's play some football huh you guys ready to use the two week\nStaggering it's a big right environment today [noise] um\nRight after the last game we got back into a normal game waiting for our guys and then did a whole week of preparation on on South Carolina ended so Tuesday practice Wednesday practiced Thursday walk through practice a and then Sunday night so they're ready to play the game\nAnd excited I Know we'll get the best shot across her film from our will and his guys out our kids are anxious go play and it's been\nA good series has an Missouri in South Carolina and the SEC is in a big one here today I Would\nSay yeah they're all big but this one this one because it's the next one coach street there but also\nOur guys uh they're they're ready to go play and I think there are some natural rivalries middle end of this game for for whatever reason and uh the only thing that happens when there's a respect on both sides but also ah two pretty evenly matched teams as we look across the more it will\nMust Tampa defensive background much like yourself heck I look around the SPCA she gets to Kentucky smarter Georgia Vanderbilt Pruitt of Tennessee all these defensive guys as head coaches and this division what do you expect that from will team in particular and what you know and like about\nHim while they were going to the sides of the ... the line of scrimmage there's going to be so important uh to the success [noise] whatever team had success it's\nGoing to start at ... and I think there'll be ... or ... or is it was really really solid placed firmly hard there well coached obviously\nBack and they match up the route concepts it'd be very aggressive and the way that they do that and then I'll ... men creative enough in different ways either running the bars some different formations that we're going to get [noise] um ... I wouldn't even challenges are going to be a lot of opportunities and the you look at\nThe matchup show I like our own line against their tea line and then already plans on line we need to find ways\nTo control the line of scrimmage ever establish that run\nIs probably going to be a lot easier for them as the game starts and gets into the to the heart of the game one\nLast question their quarterback obviously Jake Bentley yeah there was talk early in the wake he may not play and setting a press conference and granted that was back on Tuesday you've still expect him to play and I know you have to be wary of that but even since we've arrived turnout multiple reports that a ... a senior who's never started before will be to start or find out soon enough but\nHow has that affected your plans for this game is at all for a kid got much showed me this look just say you understand the differences in the two on on what we know about 'em both and then also I think they'll play their troop restaurant on it but uh you know that this super athlete and ah so our staff has\nHas done a nice job on the Senate gather what we think misfits for a situation we're going to get [laughter]\nWe'll have eleven guys out there and I bet they will to locate\nCoach thanks best of luck today that's coach Barry autumn so I'm Mike and bread interesting story line here with a\nSouth Carolina's quarterbacks spotted you know we'll see your family does in fact not make the start they've got the seniors cardiac yeah they've got the youngster you old and coach just mentioned the dual threat so a lot of storylines heading into a big one today is do it in the south Carolina fellows\nFriday thanks a lot of credit micro electrical I didn't want you to finish your thought their commissioner ... at a kind of a ... a day with them and you talk a little bit about the inexperienced but football games\nWill union and they're concerned about that and and and it began with talking about peace to play ... Lincoln game pace to play one of the things to do that they're constantly trying to do is find ways to keep their their their fans engaged throughout the course of the game and the result\nIt was find ways to keep their their their fans engaged throughout the course of the game but there was a lot of different things that that we talked about the book but one thing that are seen and it's only in the SEC so did the league has taken a step before anyone else in terms of trying to come up with [laughter]\nWith a company to keep the fans engaging that's at the clock that you see on the sidelines but now when you go to a TV break\nThe solid do whatever they put up two and a half or three minutes and then once that clock is over we're playing football so there is no more you know solving it just for a little bit longer waiting for TV to join us know when you go to the break it is whatever the late ... and that's one way of trying to keep the fans engaged immunity among the other thing is\nThey were hostile acts on the arrive alive tiger tailgate on the record at work ... airfield\nMask most anyone who lives in South ... served their favorite food the ladies ghrelin Bob you'll find the best wings burgers Boston sandwiches salads grandkids menu and of course cold beer when our hometown team ball special among\n... ghrelin of Ninety nine forty can at least that are across from state to answer these hospitals open seven days a week for great food\nSports TV and of course golden beer and\nIs your whole map sinking concrete maybe this is maybe the driveways sidewalk her patio do listening ... value our curb appeal from your home for cleaned another victim call but he's been system research thinking Congress safely and neatly with high level\nWhen the methodology that it would be ending for Hollywood that's clean solid called the fraction of replacement walk or drive on it and just a minute I wouldn't worry at eight six six five eighty one ten eighty one on line of systems dot com\nAnd\nYou want to give your home a warm new ... your first stop should be to St Charles hardwood there the best when it comes to hardwood flooring doors dance they're part of what markets actual moldy product\nCharles hardwood staff has the knowledge in when tore and tools to give your home a warm fresh blood they own their own meal took us to borders are no problems at St Charles how words on main rivers mall drive in St Peter's or go to St Charles hardwood dot com\nVoting for mortgage you long for the ideal home\nRoyal bank she'll Missouri will provide the foundation and help you open the door to a fantastic mortgage rates you still have time to lock in on a low mortgage rates you can manage you remove ruined for two and two Fifteen hundred to talk to an experience mortgage lender you can trust oil ...

down\nTo the shoestring in your seat is just so as you know I can remember freshman year in high school we had to provide their own shorts and they provided the top for us it didn't even have a they had gross city our high school but that was it\nAnd then we put our own numbers are fighting for everything\nYou went from there in Ohio too much to do and you said that at the time you weren't really sure that that you could hack it as a division one player ended up doing OK honorable mention the whole American under Joanne Rutherford all big eight white\nDoing okay honorable mention the whole American under Joanne Rutherford all big eight white made a couple in the eighth tournament but what was it that kind of ... a little bit frightened David ... who come again [noise] [noise]\nWell I I actually um my high school we did not have much of a team in fact my father prepared and to me that I probably would not get things like all state because you know we are changes doesn't go anywhere and I was pretty much um the team and and\nSo it was one of those things when I started getting recruiting and I\nHad the dilemma of do I want to go to a a a big college or do I want to say a small college because the coaches at the small college or saying I could probably come in and just start\nYou know and and um I wanted to get out of the Big Ten because of the big can really had no women's basketball to look up to the back of the time and like I think sometimes a\nSort of the players today I knew a lot of history a lot of the players before me um you know from Sharon fair and to\nTo Susanna all Nancy router all before me because they're the ones that really kind of started the program was for us for\nBut it was Joanne routes for that\nI thought I needed the discipline\nUm and I ultimately decided to do is or for their for that reason because I thought it would be the biggest challenge\nBut through athletics hall of famer Lorraine ferret joining us on the arrive alive tiger tailgate you're still talk to an all time in school history and boring and rebounding from Europe successful run it was do you went on to Italy and Switzerland as a pro what was that experience like in Europe compared to college ball\nA division two college level\nI average forty one points a game [noise] um I was the first American Woman to ever play professionally in Switzerland so that was a big deal because no one likes me at first um why was that they\nThey just wanted to do it without a foreigner Italy and Switzerland we're\nI'm pretty advanced they were allowing a one for her change it come into play and and most times as far as we're Americans but they could be from other countries [noise] um and then as Spain and Italy where the first actually allowed to players to come in\nBut Switzerland had not\nThey didn't want to have Americans come in and and so I was kind of an ... there because it just\nWas I I felt like I had to turn everybody you know just to find out [laughter] you know I'm OK I'm just going to come in here now I didn't get to play with two teams in Switzerland and and but last team in Bern we we won the championship [noise] so that was a fun\nOrion ferret

linebacker tailgate our gas is a Nobel Prize winner if that is a that's a\nFirst for the arrival life tiger tailgate is George Smith the professor emeritus from a zoo got the news about the big award on Wednesday and you know first of all of course the big question a lot of people's mind when you got the call that a guy who calls you sound like the guy the Swedish Chef from them up at the really good question um\nWell he sort of fight and I don't know I I don't remember the Swedish Chef from from the Muppets but he certainly had a Swedish accent but you know my my friends can take Swedish accent and I you know call as a as a prank and say\nYou know we're ... and this is the Swedish Academy of science and you won the Nobel Prize you know to get ready to take people in but I knew that wasn't true because the connection was so bad that couldn't have been sort of\nA more serious note after your your decades of work in science and this to to get that call that you're a Nobel Prize winner what does that mean deal\nMeant a great deal that meant a great deal to me uh to all the people in my lab that were um that were really instrumental in getting the um the work done I mean you know one person really couldn't can't do this or can't do this by him or herself [laughter]\nAnd um it's also I Would say an honor to\nThe whole field interconnected I'm an area that the science research and science and and and um\nApplied a science I'm expecting a prize a representative of a whole big field with huge numbers of people that have contributed to the um the research from\nTalking with was a professor emeritus short Smith that out on Wednesday that he is a Nobel Prize winner so you share the award with a couple of other researchers you work with a guy from Cambridge at all I mean I'm going to say it right phage display of peptides an anti bodies so what exactly what was it that you were doing\nWell um pages are bacterial virus that they are a virus that particularly easy to work with and also the completely safe they're sort of traditional\nUm experimental system than in a molecular biology and patriots play really built on that it's a it's a technology that just uses very simple easy to master\nUm classical micro biological techniques that have been around certainly since the fifties there very few things that we do that weren't invented in the fifties\nHow could this potentially have an application that helps people that are dealing with cancer for example right now\nThe copper person for answering that would be one of the other winners which is Craig winter at the end I'm a ... at Cambridge in England [noise] um so she not me but he has a applied\nPhages play technology to discover and to optimize antibodies that have particular\nA desire properties and one of the most um uh important and prominent of those properties this property against disease antibodies that would help ameliorate [noise]\nUm I'm an immune to the the but just ... for example or a cancer a mirror mirror is as a medicine that that's an antibody against immune diseases and is had widely used\nFor diseases like drones and other other immune to
