friday they announced that they um had captured the bomber in Florida right and we had talked to a couple of people that in the morning and I asked I think we were talking to the chief of detectives in New York City and we asked him a I said when when do you think you're going to when do you think you're going to get the guy\nAnd he said uh we'll get him soon basically like\nAn hour right yeah yeah we're actually closing and don't go anywhere ... will will get it yeah and\nYou know you just knew and I even think I said at one point when it the first ... the first bomb was Tuesday that they picked from George Soros his house and then they intercepted the bombs on Wednesday from the Clintons and then friday at ten o'clock they caught the guy\nRight and then it was Robert De Niro and has no man right and his running is is that right yeah here's how they did it\nThese guys are good by the way a single fingerprint was taken from the bomb that was sent to representative Maxine Waters\nThat was the key right one fingerprint\nSaid this is we're not talking about a criminal mastermind are we didn't\nWell listen to this okay um all of the devices captured throughout the week were sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia\nOn Thursday they were able to lift the one fingerprint from uh from Maxine Waters officials ran the fingerprints to the national database and it came back the name of this Caesar say Iraq with the name\nThey then were able to locate a possible phone number then went to the courts and got a court order applies a warrant if you will\nA that allowed them to triangulate his cell phone data to find his location\nAnd on friday morning at whatever was nine thirty ten o'clock they I'm pulled him over in front of an auto zone uh they said that they found fingerprints and a possible DNA connection on two of the Thirteen devices\nYeah they said that parents there was so much\nEvidence that they I guess with here between your social media flick printed in the United States Postal service uh and then you've got that the feds working on it from Quantico to Los Angeles and everywhere in between I but I Do think\nI Do think that criminals are getting a little less\nMindful is it too many things to keep track of them I don't know he used to just the fingerprints yeah hiding the weapon destroying the weapon destroying the evidence that now and now\nOfficials have a lot more tools and he ... on your cell phone use broken glass and the PVC\nBecause the a bomb maker or so they think want it to ensure that the device was was light as possible to avoid shipping restrictions\nCool how broken glass is a filler is lighter than nails or other metal\nThe postal service requires back just way more than Thirteen ounces to be shipped from the retail counter\n[noise] so um they return heavier packages that are dropped in the mailbox or the slot so he was smart enough to make it lighter than Thirteen ounces so he could drop it off in the mailbox and not have to go to the counter\nAnd I hate to ask this question but you have to today have you also heard the thing about the steroids where he was I mean he he was a male and he was an exotic dancer and he he was dabbled\nIn the mail service because he was sending steroids back and forth\nYou know I wasn't implying that at all I was just saying the the steroid does that make the

honest I'm a little tired but I have this is my favorite part uh when I'm Out every day all day from very early until very late\nI'm at a lot of hot and stranger\nYou know it's it's it's fun because people um you know because of all of a ridiculous television they recognize me and people are still kind of almost a few people that are jerks but [laughter] everybody is very nice it's energizing it's\nSounds like you went to a to a radio conventions most of us are nice but some of us are jerks go over the last Seventy two hours of the country has gone through quite a bit with this bomber and now there's a synagogue in the United States Senate or what are you thinking what are you saying\nI Do think um that we all need to turn the temperature down um and I\nIt has become very very\nTribal and very\nUm you know the rhetoric has gone places and I frankly never expected it to go\nA and some of that starts at the top\nUm and so I\nI think it's really important and and this is self serving and I'm the first acknowledge it that it's really important that we tend to be able to Washington who don't see the other side as the enemy\nUm I work with my Republican colleagues we work across I work right now that's why I get something done because I'm not one of those it just had a knee jerk reaction that if they're in the other party they stink\nI well there are so much stuff we agree on\nWhat gras there's so many things that we can come together on if we can quit tried to demonize\nAnd it's been hard for me in his campaign to get the other side has basically just tried to distort the facts and demonize me\nAnd um I got after Josh highly on what he's done with his job on preexisting condition\nUm I have it certainly I have not done a soul broadside character attack on him like that they have done on me by distorting and lying about my record that these kinds of politics is what's contributing to that and frankly it turns people off people just don't want to get sick of it\nAnd I know people are hungry for us to get together and and unite around things where we can make things better for people and so I Hope people realize that\nI think I can be part of that it failed\nOh people realize that\nI think I can be part of that if they will give me a chance to serve again\nThis election you mentioned is a a lot about pre existing conditions Josh Hawley has said that use in favor of having bridges in conditions covered but it can be done cheaper and less expensive without the Affordable CARE Act what do you\nKnow ... it's a press release um policy it it it does not hold up under scrutiny um if if this were easy don't you think the Republicans would have already done it they preached to repeal and replace for years before they got into power\nThen they got into power and they figure it out it's hard and replace proposal say put I couldn't even get enough Republican votes to pass because they were going to be so harmful to people\nThey were going to be so unpopular much more popular than the CIA so I'm ... and here's the thing about Josh Holly's deal about pre existing conditions he knew when he filed the lawsuit that he was going to wipe out all of the protections that people have\nAnd he knows there is no backup and all people need to realize is when he went to court\nIn September the lawyers asked the judge to not make a decision until after November\nThat tells you pretty much all you need to know that they know if they win in this case that there is no backup\nThere is no safety net and there will be chaos because I'll be a lot of people in Missouri that may not be able to get their insurance policy at the end of the year because we'll be back to the days where insurance companies can say no we're not going to insure you

that's got to be one of the toughest law says I've ever seen a football team give up\nTheir adding up a you know ... fans have a long list a\nTough and uh you know certainly at the kind of when that would really be a feather and burial Tums kept up you know I was one of the few people who are trying to tell people look Kentucky is a good team I'm not just because there are ranked twelve of the country because of how they played this these then the right fit\nYou know we do fans tend to have a perception problem when it comes to Kentucky football\nThey they think Kentucky is just a basketball school they know they beat them when they entered the Congress will they haven't beat them or seen the best Kentucky football team that that the FCC has seen during that time um so uh when it gets conduct you would have been a very big deal the problem in the Kentucky all season\nHas found ways to win games that they don't always do it in a pretty fast and they have a great defense and they are very uh very you know basic often that relies on it's running back\nAnd if he's not playing well and he wasn't on Saturday but they did a great job in the ... now that it's very hard for Kentucky to score but they just find a way and as soon as they turn that on the second half he thought oh no\nThis is a this is bad news from Missouri and they you know they just kind of fell apart and could not find a way to to score points and and this is what happens when you play a winning team they find a way and Missouri unfortunately more times than not by the way to find a way to lose\nI Know a barrier what I'm getting some criticism some of it might be deserve some of its ... ridiculous but the second to last play the one before the pass interference in the end zone where they laid off the receiver and the receiver just tried to get as many yards and then get out of bounds\nOh we're ... we're seeing all the way around could they have done it could have played that any differently\nYeah I mean you can play closer and try to force the guy down inside the you know inside the field of play like lock run there are few calls in decisions made toward the end there that are very confusing um you had you know July not take a second down there would have kept the the clock running you had\nThe decision from Missouri to throw a path on a on a um\nIf you if you have the ability to just ... o'clock in the second half when you're when you're up by a weapon on how you know a ... thing though I mean\nIt's worth mentioning that there was a bogus pass interference call late in the game I mean I think we all five it's all\nIt's easy to watch and even even you know independent observers can say that that was a bad event that pass interference call for the problem is research that I've ever been in that spot in the first place when you're up a weapon on on on our ranked team you have to find ways to put your foot on the road at the Missouri does the opposite of that\nYou know can we even though this pains me to admit it I'm ... with the red Sox winning the world series we have to at least acknowledge that if they're the biggest ones are one of the biggest one when it comes to analytics right so\nAnalytics or here to stay if the team that's heavily invested in it keeps on winning\nThe red Sox are kind of actually a a good example of the boy in um you know they they value every team values analytics and we got we got to be smart about how we talk about this\nThere's not a team in baseball it's not using analytics for some reason analytics has turned into this dirty buzz word of sorts and it's for people who don't have an interest in understanding you know what it's like or what it means and they just want to label it\nBig data analytics and throw it on the least throw it on anything that takes up starting pitcher out of the game too early and they're paid analytics says a lot of stuff analytics is you know how fast the guy runs around the bases analytic split the getting\nDifferent pictures I mean to some degree a batting average which is the most basic outmoded form of factors analytics talking right that this notion that analytics is the best thing we got we got to be better than that just information\nEach team uses it differently each team values that differently something's invest more in it than others the red Sox like anything use it but the Dodgers I guess for you to more the analytics\nNo guru in this in this World Series the red Sox for almost world school on that and that's why you're hearing some of the old school\nFans you know ... holler and beat their chests about an old school team getting down to the reds get the red Sox are not old school two terms or that they're not using\nNumbers and the only using scout every team is using it um the red Sox I think we're a little more traditional and some of their decisions when you saw them keep going back to the David Price will you found them what their picture go later you're gonna see you're in to see the Dodgers get hammered\nSomeday Roberts for for pulling a pitcher early and it blew up on him so he's going to hear that but really the red Sox I think did a good job of\nOf of showing a blend they also did they're also going to be you know the biggest the biggest reason for fans to point to their team and say hey go spend more money because what are the teams that spend a lot of money\nIn the right to work out for them [laughter] I guess the David Price when when it's all said and done I guess it makes sense right or they want a World Series with them so yeah I'm\nActually happy for David Price man he got he got really killed he got killed in Boston a lot you know for his on his struggles he could never beat the Yankees and\nHe got he got posted a pretty good for a lot of the time that he's been there and this is quite a redemption for him\nUm that was pretty cool to see it also kind of cool to see Joe Kelly a former colonel yeah playing a part in that um you know striking on the side in the in a in a huge eighth inning there he had only struck at the side I think one other point in the season\nI'm so it was pretty cool for for him to he picked a good time to have the second one how about David trees in the world series too I mean\nHe's getting older but he doesn't look any older and he's still comes up here to me it was one of the Dodgers best players all throughout the postseason on the team really turned a corner when he joined that so yeah it's pretty impressive to see David Freese still doing David ... the postseason\nYeah All right so the Bryce Harper sweepstakes began a timeline you think we're going to know sooner rather than later\nI think winter meetings will be everything kind of get gets role and big time I don't know if you saw that the word the other day but Scott Boris made a bit of a splash prices agent is super agents got Boris went on an interview with the radio show in New York and told them that it's all wrapped up it's done by those who he wants to play for it\nIt's all but it's all about a matter of time until he announces which would have been a little confusing considering teams aren't even supposed to be able to talk to players go after the world series and\nAnd also Washington gets about that three day window to negotiate with thrown player before he truly becomes a free agent so it was it was back channel after that that's got for us was only joking\nWhen that's not the case but I'm getting the sense that Scott ... is going to enjoy the Bryce Harper free agency socket and maybe have a little fun with this after he took some bumps last year\nYeah well speaking of Scott Boris apparently he has finally secured your deal with the big five fifty K. E. T. R. S.\nUh and so apparently this just coming across the ... will be joining the eyes ups in the afternoon here on the big five fifty gave us is that true\nThat is true and I I think unless unless you have a farm this and I completely understand I think where you and I are going to talk on friday morning now as well but ah I\nEstimate that has to be talked about with your people and my people that maybe will come to some sort of an agreement but some things in the works not to not to get premature news out there too soon\nYeah I Know you're a ten five ... five player so I get to the jak\nAnything management says All right so a guy in the afternoon the more I'm Ben Fred in uh the big sports show at night and or twice a week here in the mornings on the big five fifty ... as a welcome to the welcome I guess to the family full time I guess ... thanks for the Senate\nTo have the hope is to be on the highway patrol itself now I you know I'll leave it to them to make those kind of political decisions but I think I Would much rather have preferred to have kind of up or down vote on policy and a good policy is\nA gas tax that uh reflects a misery priority than folks that money on a roadway themselves as a kind of in a roundabout way but uh it probably is still a worthwhile thing to consider a as we look forward to the future of our roadways here in the state\nPatrick what do you think of the argument that are a lot of uh outside the state of Missouri a truckers\nPeople traveling through right we've we've got all these major interstates people from all over the country when they come through there they're going to buy gas\nAnd so they're going to pick up they're going to pay for the roads they use and so some of this money is going to be coming from Adam states which doesn't necessarily right so so why we don't have to pay it out of state people are paying a portion of the ... what do you think of that side of the ...\nI I think that's probably true um I you know I I'm not inclined to support things like you know hotel taxes for instance our tourism taxes because\nYou know we're we think that other people will pay for things that's not really a great policy in general but the idea that you know people who are from out of town are using our roadways I should probably pay a portion of the car so I think that's fair and I think that the gas tax captors particularly for those who are driving across state not course\nYou can get across the state or on a tank of gas and you know if you're starting in Illinois and you end up in Kansas you may not stop for gas but you know probably is still pretty good that the that you may have stopped some place and if you do stop someplace where gas here in the state\nYou're going to end up paying the gas tax that helps maintain the road so you can keep using them in the future whether or not you're a Missouri rather than\nIt is in terms of the gas tax that part's irrelevant now I think you're right it does capture folks are traveling through the state I think that's a good thing\nYeah what do you what do you think of a well I'll tell you what you know you mentioned tolls ... uh I really come around on told I told the way it's run now you drive through Illinois they'd got souls Chicago's tolls Florida has tolls\nUm it's not in the olden days where you had to sit and wait in the long toll lines and you know wait for the guy to give you change for us for a nickel I'm told what the fast pass and all that it's a great way to pave roads\nYeah I I I agree with that I mean I've I've got a a toll sticker in my cars that drive through Kansas or Oklahoma and I I had one of those turnpike\nIt you don't really have to stop and they end up hurting your your your debit card or credit card or whatever you're you're given them a and I think they made a you know charge yeah once a month or something like that but it really is kind of a no nonsense no problem kind of undertaking then\nSo you know do you want to pay for something that you don't think that you're paying for directly ah you know probably not I I get that but you're still paying for through gas taxes you're paying for it in other ways\nI and particularly if you're not using those turnpike or you're not going to using those toll roads how you'd probably want to folks who are going to use those toll roads to pay for them rather than you have to pay for it for some other tax and stab\nYes ah also all those electric cars that are on the road to right they're not paying the gas tax\n[noise] no but I think this this proposition actually imposes some costs on alternative fuels as well it could be applied similar kind of tax on those but you're exactly right [noise] you know over time Iran figure out ways actually funding these needs and ... and I have gas\nPowered cars have become I guess less frequent er or less kind of the focus of our transportation system will have to look into the future and see exactly how how best to\nA fund our road may be totally will become more popular but uh you know I think the question before it's mostly about gas taxes will turn a fuel and the proposition that you're gonna find out it's going to deal with a little\nBit yeah he was a great point uh you know we were not were might be driving as much as we've never been but with much more fuel efficient cars so are you not buying as much gas meaning the tax has gone down really in the in in real dollars thanks thanks the more fuel efficient cars\nIn your ear exactly and that's kind of problem that we're looking at from a you know the last time that we even increased the the gas tax no Seventeen cents in Nineteen Ninety six robot that for different than Seventeen cents a gallon and twenty Eighteen particularly if\nYou're ... you're able to make thirty mile per gallon rather than you know twenty miles down we I think over time we're gonna have to make different policy adjustments on you know what were the tax is going to apply I think maybe tilling becomes a little bit more popular but\nNow in the meantime we have needs that need to be met today and people still use gas powered cars and so you know a pack that applied for those cars and looks like three or is something that probably ought to be considered\nSmile director of government accountability at the show the Institute in Kansas City as well

I. C. vouchers ... now that's not what I was saying\nThat a check here's a bottom rung job what I meant was\nAn entry level job a a working class job as a young boy as a young man are just tired or or just newly married Bob Kelley took a job as a cashier\nI wasn't I was saying how there are people who are cashiers and it's a wonderful and his ... I wasn't ... whenever I disparage somebody getting up and working no matter what the other job is but the man started off as a cashier\nAnd didn't go to the finest them schools and didn't have the finest of private schools and colleges and didn't have all the benefits of other people and he rose to the ranks of being a very powerful person and being the right hand man to congressman Bob the part\nThat was my point I wasn't disparaging anybody who was a cashier I was I was complementing the man on starting off\nRight well I said last week hey if I had to do it all over again I work for UPS wife because they're looking for drivers and you know what you start off at the bottom and you you you work your way up you start off in the mail room and you work your way up I'm not disparaging people who work in the mail rooms I'm not disparaging UPS drivers\nBut UPS drivers grow up to become the c._e._o. of\nUPS right cashiers grow up to become head of the labor union that's my point was disparaging anybody going to work as a cashier really I mean\nAlright there's another one in here um\n[laughter] uh\n... why can't the Hondurans just immigrate legally\nAnd why is now the time to leave one of the problems have been there for many years surely there is a better way to come here than just show up without vetting first of all can we say that we really we were really that worried about five thousand\nStarving immigrants walking in the heat through Central America somehow they're going to invade the country\nIt's not illegal to present yourself at the border for asylum\nOkay can we get that it's not illegal to get to our shores and say you know what I Am I I'm being persecuted in my own country\nThat's not a legal there is a process when somebody gets to the border\nWhen somebody gets to the border\nAnd says I'm being persecuted right and what happens there is a process they are vetted they are screened they are take they are dealt with in a humane manner so that um if they are deemed to be\nUm a refugee if there there's all sorts of status it's not um they're coming in and if we let these people and they're going to overrun America I think it's safe to say that we can probably take five thousand immigrant migrant workers who are running from a burning building\nA Honduras or the look on doors in ... and Central America and some of the others are going through\nA massive amounts of change and there are a lot of strong men who are being elected I'm In right in all sorts of weird ways and um they don't have a very stable democracy and so people are if you don't go along with the party platform\nIf you're on the wrong side of the majority right you are being you are there's all sorts of terrible things going on and these ... these people would rather take their chances walking through the desert\nNorth and hopefully there's a better way right\n[noise] uh they're wandering in the desert\nJust to find a better place and so uh I think we need to be a little more sympathetic to them [noise] um no one's calling for open borders\nBut there is a process and there was a process in place when people do get to our shores uh remember alien Gonzales remember\nHe did not get to our shores he was rescued both his mother died\nA and it was a boat that they tried to rescue a they tried to escape Cuba they've gotten a boat the mother died that that child ailing Gonzales in what was his two thousand Nineteen Ninety Ninety thousand um he was picked up by the coast guard's so we never made it to the shore and then ultimately he was had to be sent back\nBecause the law is the law\nAnd um if you would have gotten to the shores he would have stayed but the laws very specific if you don't get to the shore right there's there was a different type of status\nI'm certainly no I'm In a legal immigrant scholar um\nBut I Do find it interesting that at that point president\nClinton wanted to send back the illegal immigrants and he was ostracized for it now the the Republican Party is against all these illegal him are immigrants but what they ... they were for it I find that somewhat interesting um\nNine forty seven here big five fifty K.
