he was in front of the committee\nWell for that matter [noise] back valid point what's of a woman said I might have been too emotional at times in my testimony\nYeah because we are often accused of being too emotional yes so you know either way\nBut by the end that apart but not only that can a woman be emotional and then to admit okay maybe I was too emotional and that not necessarily backfire

me for me stand by me it was a haunting movie it haunted me I don't mean that in a bad way like I was afraid I was just a it was so touched\nA nerve right I mean that when when something is that good right when something touches you want a book to and you want a piece of art such as you whether it's a movie or an art or a book or a painting or a sculpture right there are things that just sort of touched you yeah I'm In that stand by me but that's also this movie to\nLa la land was a good movie I enjoy the music was fun I liked the ending I was I was a it was a good move in this is a different type of movie it was a movie that really you need to\nUh think about ... life's journey things you want to do the things you don't want to do the things you're afraid to do\nThe same alone land I mean they had a reaction either one way or the other ... some people just I had a friend who walked out of the movie who didn't like it\nWell I had the same life's journey and the decisions that you may\nAsk but I also think that there are people who um [noise] not to get to philosophical here but I think there are people who um\nYou know sometimes it's too painful to self exam in your life right through so I don't I Will I don't want to examine my life I'd much rather ridicule you for liking something it's much easier\nRight now I'm In this in this social media world where it's much easier to ... somebody and it is to actually listen to what they say is I boy you know what that's the point of view I I hadn't thought of before ... that's interesting yeah let me let me think about that right\nUm while you're you're on a life's journey you're you walked ... don't you know those people in your life\nNot so much now 'cause we're older but when we were high school and college and you're younger does\nBut there were friends who came into your life\nThat were just walked to a different beep\nMhm they just they had a different era about them they just did things differently they didn't go with the crowd they were just sort of\nI don't want to say was wonder loss was just sort of but just did their own thing yeah you know and it was like wow that's what what are you I'm I really want to do this um and I you sort of lose that as you get older but you know how many times do you not do something in life because you're afraid\nAnd also I think I was telling me about one of my former coworkers who recently died yeah as of yesterday and\nWhen stuff like that when you have a law that also makes you look within yourself and and re examine the choices that you have made and looking forward to things that you want to do in life\nRight and I'm not saying that you know a good Batman movie or good Superman Movie is just fun to go and watch them but you don't leave that movie soldiers a boy you know what I really I really need to dissect this movie I Can't believe Superman save the world ... whereas that's popcorn\nMovie that's ice cream this movie is steak and potatoes and vegetables and uh wow this is a meet this movie is a meal so\nSapping but you know\nIt'd be interesting and Jason Nathan fences review is going to be completely honest movies terrible\nThat was really the whole point though I don't I don't think so I mean I I\nAgain you can go to the movie and not like it but I'm going to I'm going to challenge you to tell me why you don't like this movie\nRight and it can't be that if I didn't buy him as an act as a singer or she wasn't right I mean that doesn't count 'em because you know it's a story it's a it's a story about life it's a story about figuring things out the story about love a story about addiction story about I mean it's just a great story and I've talked way too much about it but\nIt's OK so first you know it's a it's a really powerful it's a really really powerful movie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn YouTube I could not I don't know high school\nI I tell you I'm a girl I had a girl friend of mine who has told me uh she's now married now is that kids but she told me\nThat when she was in high school and college that if a guy had enough guts to ask around the date ... automatically give them one day\nWow didn't matter didn't not somebody ... enough guts to ask me ... she would automatically say yes wow everybody got at least one day\nDo they go they want to hear being five fifty ... here as Jason Nathan's in ABC News entertainment corresponding from Los Angeles big weekend at the box office good morning Jason\nDo you have your friends number by the way [laughter] being married now James ... yeah yeah All right Jason everybody wants to know uh we're we're here with bated breath\nEveryone's chimed in on a star is born what do you think what do you know\nIt it is one of the most type movies of the year so far uh they're talking Oscars for Lady Gaga Bradley Cooper if you read the reviews it's given the Oscars already I Will say it is over hype not that it's a bad movie at all it is it is a very very good movie but\nKen Berger expectations I think a little bit going into it it's not the be all end all of movies Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga star and this story which we've seen before this is the fourth one by the way a yet that Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand before we haven't had a stars born in quite a while so a lot of people probably don't know I remember those right\nUm but Bradley Cooper directs this and he is fantastic he's going to get an Oscar nomination for shore a Lady Gaga is also a very good stripped down about her Lady Gaga ness\nUm she is very real very playing in this movie and the two of them singing together who know Bradley Cooper had such a great voice\nUm but he really does and he can rock um and there's this movie is a lot of fun I had some serious problems with it towards the end and choices that they made which I Can't really get into without spoiling it um but I I did really enjoy\nMost of it and it is a ... it's a lot of fun it is emotional\nOr I Will say that most of the and you know not to be sexist but I thought it was mostly women at the end of this film and my screening were crying their eyes out I mean tears streaming down their faces and ... not bubble the whole thing I mean they really got emotional at the end\nShowed that and that's what the film is trying to make you do so it worked in a lot of\nWays that I agree with you too to some extent but he and talk about uh Jason Holly this is an adult movie for adults and Hollywood doesn't make adult movies anymore like this\n[noise] I mean I don't know I this is the time and the air where we're going to get a lot of these ah it's all the time and this is definitely an Oscar movie so we have this we have\nFirst man coming out next week which is about Neil Armstrong and or the moon landing a which is a very adult movie um most of the I think the the Oscar caliber movies\nAre adult movies so uh you know this is this is this is one of those and I I think we we get a fair amount of those\nUh each year that was most of them don't get as much hype and they don't do as well at the box office is this is probably going to do this is going to make thirty million dollars or so this weekend it's easily gonna make a hundred million dollars or more a lot of those Oscar caliber movies don't\nMake that kind of money um which is maybe why the studios don't make as much of them as they would like\nRight how come this is getting\nUm which is maybe why the studios don't make as much as it with like right how come this is getting so much hype\nBecause it had a long time on the festival circuit a debuting I Believe at Venice and then it was at Toronto and and so many of those and winning lots of awards and the the they've done a press toward that seems like it's gone on for two months so\nYou've seen so many people so many red carpets that they've had ... and all the city is in London in Hollywood and an app these film festival so they really milked the publicity for this\n... and got a good job about it but the early a lot of this is a lot of people were anticipating this for a while because\nThey've been trying to remake this for several years originally Beyonce was attached and then when they did this Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga version a lot of people were excited about that they were filming scenes at Coachella last year and there was bugged behind that so there's been bugged behind this movie for a long time\nI did I read somewhere that somebody tried to talk of Bradley Cooper out of making this this movie\nI didn't see that um if it's possible I guess I mean and it's really hard thing to do to star in a movie and directed at the same time and get to perform he gives a fantastic performance I mean Bradley Cooper really sinks into this role in ... he kind of disappears he\nChanges his voice in a way that\nYou know not gimmicky uh you really kind of believe it uh and he sings in rocks um and then to direct it as as well and is the first movie he's ever directed and he gets a lot of credit for directing Lady Gaga who\nYou know she's got a she brings a lot of baggage to all wrong because it's hard not to the Lady Gaga hum and the way he does this you know you see Stephanie who which which has her real name\n'em and you don't see the big star although there are so many parallels between her rise to start a man and her characters rise to start 'em ... help compare that\nTo yeah I loved the ensemble cast a Chappelle was greats Andrew dice clay was great I I mean I think there was a clunker in the bunch\nAndrew dice clay or is a lot of fun playing a lady got his dad I really like everything he was in with a lot of fun [noise] Dave Chappelle\nI enjoyed 'em and I enjoyed and being a little more serious and not the comic relief but I Would have like more of him I mean even if he was barely years um and Sam Eliot as great as Bradley Cooper his older brother\nYou know a A R I or Jason you can come back next week I'd like to talk to you off there about this because I I agree with you and I disagree with you with your criticism about the end of the movie but that's what that's what makes an sitting argue and debate it and argue it and everything else but there's a great movie uh Jason thanks for checking in\nTwenty six year big five fifty ...\nSo were you a clicking not totally pleased with his review\nAct it you can't you know I

couple of different styles\nExplain these hundred and sixty sort of designated areas throughout the state I've never heard of that\nBefore so yes so natural areas as I mentioned these are areas that are we have a multi division of agency committee that examined these areas so what they do is someone will nominate an area for natural areas status so the committee you know usually takes a reconnaissance so the area examines what's there\nAnd they make a designated make a decision as to whether they think this is worthy of going into the natural areas system or not if it is and it's awarded natural area status and it gets special protections and things like that\nSo there's a number of natural areas in the St Louis area to um we can do a whole show on those there's value blades for one and and uh uh a couple of others so and these are areas as I say that represent either something unique geologically they represent unique plant life\nOr they represent some unique pristine snapshot of what things look like before humans came in and disturb the area so\nYeah we got ... question for you sure somebody wants to know the dog friendly\nOr you can bring dogs they're on leashes

I'd have to double check the regulations or maybe some hunting and in the areas it under certain regulations so I don't remember off the top of my head whether that has a applies there or not and this was one of your favorite places in the state I yes I I it is it's very scenic it's a cool place to go and it's\nYou know there's a bit of a crime to get to it but it's not like mountaineering or anything so someone's in moderately decent condition and shouldn't be a problem getting too and it's not a really long hike and it's just a really a really unique area I've spent a lot of times watching sunsets there and taking pictures they're\nIll romantic and it is if you want to you know that's a great date night thing as well he likes to hide now and now we know where to go we just got to find a date for\nHughes mountain natural area and I'm sure more of this is on on line\nYeah so we have our our website online you can type ... mountain natural area or natural areas and we also have an on line atlas it's under the places or discover nature places to go link\nAnd you can find all kinds of areas by type it in the area name you can type in a county you can type in a near a city or you can type in certain features are looking for and it will return to result to you with a map and a bunch of pins different areas that you can click on and get more information including maps and everything\nAnd then I'm assuming there's more explaining to us why this geological rock is so spectacular and why\n... there's more information on there and I'm not a geologist so I Hope I didn't vote for the explanation right right right yeah but it's a really nice area\nReally thump dancer laying a good good thanks for coming in here thank you or a forty five year big five fifty gate T.
