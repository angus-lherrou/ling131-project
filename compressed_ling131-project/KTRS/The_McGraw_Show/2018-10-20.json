I was put on an antibiotic for thirty days it makes it a diet and fluid therapy the fluid there is a two maybe three times\nThe flu is there\nIs a suit and maybe three times a week and they say it could increase the kidney she is not real hip on eating that there are several different that this one particular\nLike wake up one of the vet said well she needs to probably stay in the early kidney food diet another vet said it's probably best to see these are regular food because the name of the game as they get hurt\nOn snow wondering first of all at the kidney food diet is something that we really need to push\nAnd secondly with her age I'm Wondering is the fluid therapy is a big old they poke in their back for the fluid that two to three times a week or more is that the best way to go is there is there any other approach that might be good for her you know a little bit less invasive\nSure sure I'm ... all you know can you do these can be a little bit frustrating obviously we can't we can't fix the already the disease that has already occurred so the goal of the ... name of the game is to try to slow the progression down and and you know we don't do dialysis and animals\nUm so we can't filter her blood like like we would if we had kidney disease ourselves so the fluid therapy is probably the best way to help try to keep\nHer hydrated because dehydration is a very big problem with our kidney kitty cats and it also kind of helps flush some of those toxins that the kidneys can't clear\nAnd some fluid therapy actually is a pretty big import in portion of\nKnow trying to a treaty kitty cat that has kidney disease [noise] um and unfortunately yes the poking his is nobody wants to do that and neither do way but it does and animals do tend to get used to it and and it's actually\nYou know it's not a fun thing but but it can give them a longer longer quality of life here\nUm in terms of the diet\nI'm obviously in my opinion I Would rather than eat the not eat it all so if the kidney diet is just absolutely not happening then certainly I'd rather them each a diet that they're willing to eat\nAlthough there are multiple types of kidney diets that are out there um different companies that make renal diets that you can certainly try and most of them have some sort of money back guarantee\nWhen you're purchasing those foods that if the cat doesn't eat him or doesn't like them they'll return your money so you're not out necessarily a whole bunch of money trying to buy a whole bunch of food is for some reason I'm Sorry go ahead\nI'm Sorry and they thought maybe what which dry yeah\nWe're just gonna ever you were reading my mind I was actually just about to say that a lot of times we want them to eat canned food because canned food is fifty percent water\nAnd so again that gives them more moisture in their diet helps with their hydration butter and I'm In and helps with that and when we have kitty cats that are not do that do not have kidney disease actually recommend canned food just to try to help\n'em reduced a strain on the ... and try to prolong the inevitable of kidney disease because that's really really common in our cats\nUm they do make a [noise] you know can can canned food definitely important\nUm they've actually has found I actually one of my colleagues have just gone to a a continue education thing a few weeks ago and they are actually talking about renal diets but also supplementing those renal diets with additional protein and actually I'm finding that cats\nIf they don't get enough protein will start losing muscle mass and start losing weight and so they suggested to recommend actually adding like ... chicken or something in with their renal diets to help give them additional protein that might be something to also to talk about your veterinarian because that might also encourage the kitty cat to eat to\nSomeone did mention hands chicken or Canton with maybe a good thing\nYeah so so yeah the the required that that protein cats are are ... you know they basically restrict protein restrict protein when we have animals kidney disease but actually they found with cats that they they do have to have some sort of ... some form of protein it's not as restricted because of their their muscle mass and weight that that they require\nSo that sounds great because it also brought a vitamin a like a fish oil item and types of\nFish oil the natural anti inflammatory slug at times I use that for for my cats as well\nUm and you know making sure that you monitor you know really the important thing is is following through monitoring enzymes making sure any might at some point start her on some sort of phosphorus minors and things like that to help as well there are lots of things we can do to try to help slow down the progression make them feel good\nThank you so much when I Walk are not any kind of a prevention or other cats that we have several other\nUnfortunately not really except like shake hands food making sure they have appropriate amount of water and most cats don't drink enough water and that's one of the one of the downfall of cats they they don't drink a lot so having water fountains in the house offering them canned food those are all Bennett bonuses\nWonderful and I thank you so you're very welcome I'm\nAll right thank you darling or corals on the line but we're gonna have to\nLeave him on hold girl just hang out there are we going to bring some good are we going thirty minutes during Berliners flies by it really does for us we'll take a break and we'll come back we'll answer more phone calls nine six nine five eight seven seven nine six two tea or as\nDr Deborah Kades ... animal hospital is are a bit of a big boost to the Purina animal advice you on the big five fifty to rush\nI have um several cats and a cup or obese\nHow do I get laid their food um\nWhile allowing the elder outweigh care to to eat\nOkay that's that's a good question and a question that get quite a bit we'll start with the with the feral cat diarrhea\nUm there's [noise] unfortunately for ... for feral cats that you really can't do a lot of handling this maybe a little bit of a challenge to be able to make her okay Matty if you know unfortunately outdoor cats\nRun of the most common things are garbage dump urge you know they they did a garbage divers they eat pretty much everything they can possibly put their their paws on to try to keep their nutrition out but they also um can pick up parasites quite easily too\nSo it could be something parasitic it could be a dietary problem unfortunately outdoor cats can also get you know inflammatory bowel disease there's a whole bunch of potential possibilities and it's really I don't know if there is an easy way for you to be able to treat the diarrhea short of trying to collect them and get\nYou know get them to the veterinarian or at least try to collect the stool sample\nAnd maybe had a little sample evaluated [noise]\nTo see if there's something parasitic going on you can certainly if you're feeding him you can certainly offer him\nMore um you know sensitive stomach type foods I'm named do also make 'em over the counter products that you can put in with the food to kind of help you know put normal bacteria backing us tell me again but if there's not a lot of handling that you can do and that's probably the easiest each thing you can try and get a stool sample to try to still sample\nAnd um maybe the diet itself\nUnfortunately most veterinarians are not going to be able to laugh\nTreated any medicate medications because we have to have some sort of you know patients relationship to be able to do is you know to get medications to kitty cat so they would ... you would have to be evaluated by a veterinarian to be able to get medications unless you get like an over the counter the warmer which you could certainly try\n'em to see if that might help\nIn terms of the overweight kitty cats in the house versus the ones that are normal way to um if there is a\nWay that you can do feeding\nSet feeding during the day and and put each individual cat and an individual area that would be ideal they actually do make and I don't know how expensive they are they do make 'em food dispensers that actually have\nUm and that you can and they can make collars that she can put on the cats that actually each individual cat has its own color to to cause the thing to open up the little the food dispenser open up for them to eat\nAnd it won't open if the collar doesn't match the dispenser so the dispenser stays closed unless the other cat the cat that supposed to get it\nIs there an animal that sounds effect\nIs confusing or not but that might be something that you can try or unfortunately just having to separate they're feeding and making sure that you're measuring food intake for the overweight cats\nOh that sounds great yeah or I\nCan't remember a ... year while we helped 'em your colleague told me one time a feral cats when they're out there a question about a cat feral cat that was having\nTo use it 'cause I don't ... I'm outside and I don't know how they know that but we invited a feral cat into the house from time because we felt sorry for them and we try to keep them\nAnd he kept calling at the door one to ... yeah yeah uh but we put a little litter into a cardboard box and he would write towards it and went to the bathroom me because they just know that that's where that's where they're supposed to go yeah your colleague told me that feral cats out in the wild will find\nPlaygrounds and winter sand boxes and boxes yet because that\nIs that is that this kind of ...\nCan bury their stuff right now I Can't
