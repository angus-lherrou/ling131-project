week and then over yet then doesn't have anything on his schedule until about three o'clock when he had that the Cincinnati for a campaign rally so\nWe'll see what today brings that yesterday was one of those days are he felt like it was coming from every side the president at a forty five minute interview live by phone with Fox and friends in the morning he had several bills signings where he spoke and took questions from reporters at the White House\nAnd that was all before Kanye West and kid rock showed up and they weren't even here together and they were here for separate events and the

it was a campaign rally speaking to the crowd and uh he drives this little bitty on the audience\nTo look at it when you think of it [noise] it was Hillary Hillary Democrats and Russia was [noise]\nLots of other people by the way [noise]\nSo that's what he said on Wednesday night in Pennsylvania Hillary Clinton\nResponded to that with a tweet of her own she re tweeted a story from NBC News\nHighlighting the fact that Donald Trump at this\nRally are accused her of engaging in a conspiracy and collusion in the election and she tweeted out to the world\nAnd I quote\nSeriously\nU.S Russia to hack me on national television unquote [laughter]\n\nSo freaked at seven\nAnd five fifty gay T. R. us let me tell you that can be held big if you're looking for a house looked over other\nMen Kathy helping looking to buy a house that look at the real estate being what it is today interest rates are going up rights as she calls it a dual market you've got some housing\nSome housing market's going up some housing markets cooling off a little bit uh you want to find that that sweet spot Kathy how big no sense that you don't hear that from other realtors you don't hear that from other experts because right she has her\nSeeking to stay in the U.S permanently [noise] ah he went to Istanbul to get some documentation for his upcoming wedding\nIf he wasn't hacked killed by the Saudi Arabians\nI'm a good question also as what did we know there are reports that our intelligence community may have had indications\nThat there were some type of clock either kidnapped or shuttling back to Saudi Arabia the question is did they inform the White House if they did did anybody inform talk show gay and finally a to point out is what do we do about it Saudi Arabia is a close ally of ours\nAre they are a key part in our fight against al ... ISIS and other terrorist groups in the middle east\nI personally have worked with them to\nStop plots against the United states there are key trading partner but on the other hand uh at the United states\nOr were you really have to take a can deal with extra territorial killings even by our allies and so the question is what do we do we imposing economic sanctions or do we impact planned arms transactions where they were going to buy weapons from us\nIf we don't do anything why not and that that's the debate that's going on in Washington right now\nAll right so a ... it's just sort of understand this this isn't a rogue Saudi Arabian citizen Mrs technically if it's inside the embassy in Turkey that's technically Saudi Arabians soil so this was done by a governmental entity if it happened\n[noise] that the allegation the allegation particularly from the Turkish government is that there was a heck came I that was sent by the Saudi Arabian government that this was an operation sanctioned by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and part of this pot included alluring\nOr this or this person who is a contributor for the Washington Post\nTo that specific conflict so that he could so that he could either be kidnapped or or some have speculated so that he could be killed [noise]\nIt doesn't matter that he's a resident versus a citizen in terms of the legal or moral and ethical way America responds\nThat again an excellent question because there are a new office today I mean I think first and foremost\nUm at the United states we should we be we share core any type of extra territorial killing or even by our allies\nEven at the person who was a citizen of Saudi Saudi Arabia simply thought a security in this country and living here again he was here legally he was living in Virginia\nIn our living here again he was here legally he was living in Virginia so that should be a major cause of concern\nThe question of whether he is a citizen or a legal permanent resident is also important because it is a citizen and he's a kill the broad or in this type of incident uh the FBI may have some jurisdictions responsibilities to investigate that\nIf he's a legal permanent resident and again it's unclear because the government because the federal government for some bizarre reason has been very clear and very hesitant to provide any information about that but even if he would just simply illegal permanent rather that\nHe would fall under the protection of US law so you know I have watched that and I have thought about this from my\nPrior positions I'm kind of scratching my head why\nThe information coming out of the White House why the information coming out of the state department I ... and more clear about what we know what his immigration status was in the United states whether he was a legal permanent resident or whether he was somebody who was here on a a non immigrant visa\nOr who just was seeking to make the United states has\nAlso John Cone turkey is a NATO member and even though it happened inside the Saudi Arabian ... it was in Turkey does that does that do anything with a story\nIt just adds more intrigued to this is a story that is literally seems like something that you would be watching a movie theater\nThat turkey is a NATO ally turkey and Saudi Arabia have worked together um on on some issues in the region but turkey and Saudi Arabia also I have are at odds in certain areas\nUm turkey is more of a secular or Islamic country Saudi Arabia is a is a good country in which the ruling family has stayed in power because of their close relationship with more extreme Islamic sects\nI in the country so the idea is that there are some tensions between turkey and Saudi Arabia that exist you off or saying here the extensive intelligence capabilities of the Turks\nAre a lot of the information that's out in the public a difficult in the public fair right now it seems to be coming from the Turkish government and seems to suggest\nThat they had pretty extensive surveillance capabilities within the embassy so you know as I said before there's a lot more questions\nThan there are answers at this point uh this is not a story I suspect that it's going to going to go away in the short term primarily because they're such interest on Capitol Hill about this story because they've tied into another issue which is\nSaudi Arabia's actions in Yemen where I ... it as a result of the the the the action if they are taking in Yemen a they have killed a large number of civilians so there was attention focused on Saudi Arabia on Capitol Hill already there's certainly just to add\nTo that law and then on top of all of that you have Donald Trump saying and criticizing the media and the enemy of the people and they you know this Washington Post reporter who was critical of the prince of Saudi Arabia then deal by Saudi Arabia\nExactly it and just to to throw more intriguing to all of this you have\nUm the reports of very extensive financial interactions between\nThe Trump family and a business entity and the government of Saudi Arabia that even predate has time in the White House so it's a complicated story is a lot of questions\nUm but first and foremost we need to find out what ... what exactly happened to ... an individual who lived in the United states who are seeking security of it from the United states\nWho was a member of our journalistic community in the United states and now if the reports are accurate or he was killed in a very brutal and grotesque way by the government of a country that's an ally of ours\nJon Cohen former counterterrorism coordinator at the department of homeland security now with ABC News John Gray stuff thanks for building\nAnd I think like a seven\nTwenty six

presidential historian one of the best Michael Beschloss joined just for a couple of minutes his new book is called president's award the epic story from age you know seven to modern times Michael Beschloss welcome back to the big five fifty eight years\nBut raw great to talk\nOkay so tell us some some news in this book not just history but but news in let's sort of start there a President Lyndon Johnson could be criticized for lots of things with the Vietnam War but you discover some very interesting news here tell us about it\nYeah beginning of the eighth or Americans or about the fate of a big defeat in Vietnam\nAnd the commander in Vietnam General William ... of a plan the boom tactical nuclear weapons into Vietnam and the you know if a book like the Americans are going to lose the battle Johnson got one word of it was absolutely apple because\nEven if that happens here I'm going to clear it could bring on the rocks and the Chinese\nYou could have a nuclear war could kill tens of millions of people from the west or down immediately you know keep your nuclear weapons out of Vietnam and also take all your documents about the plan put them on a in a mixture of knowing find out about it\nAnd the result was abused were locked up for decades and I got from\nWhen I was researching the book and of all things who was on the front page of the New York times well I'm not too bad for you about the history book\nYeah pretty extraordinary what was it like when you uncovered those documents\nI think I've had a holy a year or less for holy cow as\nThe result was that it really changed my book because when you look at length of jobs have terrible mistake with Vietnam and the verdict really stands for time here of a case where he really compared to the because but McGraw the Vietnam War had gone to clear\nYou know that would have happened over a war without warning agricultural country would not have been working for something of that magnitude\nYeah the book presidents aboard the epic story from Eighteen oh seven to modern times what is the thread that you've found all these stories\nWhere I went through eight presidents from him as a matter of all the way up to the president and try to look at what drove through wage war get America involved at our largest Oregon I've tried to tell the story behind the scenes and they have far more urban breakdown of the cases\nThey draw on Grey's praying for almost ... almost always have it all came from very strong very strong live\nAt all so here's a case for some time we got into war for all three of a war we got him because James Polk fabricated a boring for them but I couldn't happen Eighteen Ninety we got into war with Spain over thinking of the main and Havana Harbor turns out that may have heard from a ... of\nMIT and sex before we got into Vietnam because Lyndon Johnson says that if there was an unprovoked attack in the Gulf of talk very quickly found out that there was such a pack yet for the next ten years\nJohnson and they're kind of ways the Vietnam War that for free tech my main thing McGraw is that the um wonderful performance of our American Soldiers cars competed over two hundred here\nThe problem is we haven't gotten always leadership from the White House\nYou ring a bell in a sense and and and what what is the message right I mean we we lived through the Persian Gulf War we lived through nine eleven there were mistakes made there we all want to support our troops we all want to support our president but you know what's the message Michael\n... is that now with the president can get a vote in a war over night without even bothering with Congress which they're supposed to do under the constitution and the best correlate or people like it\nUnder the constitution and the aura later if people like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin\nRoosevelt lake or World War two that at the time they were better leaders because they got credit for protest because on Congress to what they were doing wrong the problem is when you have a president getting involved in the war\nOn his own political reason it doesn't end well\nMichael Beschloss the book is called the presidents of war the epic story from eight to know seven to modern times I'm sure it'll be just as good as all the others I spend a couple of minutes with you about the uh the news of the day Superman pose this

Amazon\nAnd Amazon clearly gave him a ton of money to do it because each episode the first two\nThat they gave us a they were they're feeding their film linked episode there Ninety minutes apiece the first one is set in Paris it's mostly in subtitled French and ... it's beautifully shot there is a huge budget on here in a huge budget for actors as well but\nThis is one of those things that happened when you give somebody who has who you really like it has done good stuff in the past you give him\nToo much control and too much money you get something like the Romanoff are just as a sprawling\nIt's interesting um but it's it's sprawling it's way too long you kept the third is way too long\nAnd he he kind of don't know like what am I watching what's the point where is this going if they lose each episode is its own standalone thing loosely connected by being the errors of the Russian Romanoff family who are all brutally killed in the early Nineteen hundreds\nAnd all of these people are descendants in some way up the Romanoff or maybe not there so you know little question there are but it's just it's it's kind of a long math of a thing which is interesting but not great\nEr and also this weekend that's interesting also this uh I've seen a couple of commercials with his camping with a ... and Jennifer Garner\nYeah this is maybe the show that I liked the least of their share\nOf above the pilots that I saw a Jennifer Garner stars as a type a a very hyper and rigid and focused type person um ... it's not what you would expect from Lena Dunham for sure she's not in it she just she created it and wrote there\nUm but Jennifer Garner's character is show grading and so annoying\nI really try to fall apart are fairly I think it's just the which she tries to do best you can with the material that she's given up but you just don't want to watch or you don't like or not all uh ... the show I have seen the first three episodes it does get better by the third episode but I Can't imagine most people are going to sit by the first of\nAll right and what this Alec Baldwin show\nThat the new interview show for him if you know you know if you're a fan of hands you might know that he has a pod cast where he interviews people does long form interviews and it's kind of taking that and taking that into a TV show show it's a little bit of an antidote to the late night talk shows where you knew five minute interviews here you see like\nThe interviews breeze so this'll be on ABC um on on Sunday night\nThe first two guests are Robert De Niro and ... that's Alec Baldwin in conversation with these people are I have not seen it so I don't know if it's any good or not but you know if you're a fan of Alec Baldwin and kind of long form interviews with creative types [laughter] probably be something for you and if you're not then you wouldn't watch\nIt so you're going to go from match game hosted by Alec Baldwin to the ongoing show\nRight and thrown a little Trump in the middle of a soon and he's not he's not going to interview people as President Trump though that would be I think a fantastic shows\nThat would be a funny show that's Jason ... and Jason good stuff a busy week thanks for checking in part they got a twenty seven fifty ...

segment became yours truly Jackson I both agree to talking to the Missouri department grants vacation week uh and my one of my favorite is always about goods on air and shake joined this urban\nWildlife biologist with the Missouri department of conservation Arun welcome ... thanks so much for having me All right let's talk about deer and uh cars because we have to live together on the roads in in the area\nYeah and this is a time of year a which is why I'm really happy to be here talking on the radio about this topic\nThis is the time of year that we see a major spike and deer vehicle collisions why ah because we are coming into the meeting the then which is called the right so here are much much more active than they are throughout the rest of the year\nFrom about October to December with a real peak and I'm In the month of November So they're just\nRunning all over place a crossing more roads encountering more vehicles I'm so we'd probably see about half the number of beer vehicle collisions here just in these three months\nHow many how many accidents usually\nSay it's really hard to say precisely but I'm In St Louis county we likely see around three hundred or so give or take you know a hundred um each year but um St Charles county is not too far behind St Louis county anymore and they are a number of your vehicle collisions has been increasing 'em over the last Fifteen Years or so\nSo how do we avoid hitting a deer\nAwareness is the biggest thing that we can do and minimizing distractions really of course that goes with any kind of safe driving cabs bedtime\nBeing aware especially if you're on our driving through an area that's wooded and that you know that there are out there so the outer um the outer stretches of St Louis county especially where deer are dense\nWildwood I'm a Maryland heights that far south county far north county um Chesterfield all those areas so just be aware\nI'm an slow down and then if you see here on the side of the road of course slow down but um but if you've seen on crossing the road and it crosses in front of you\nBe aware that oftentimes there are other deer follow behind so infrequently that second or third year that gets Higgs not the first one is it any\nAny particular time of day seems like early morning when you know the sun is just starting to rise you may see more or at night and that\nIs actually right mhm there what we call it ... the seas\nWhich is a fun way to say to ... sometime yeah and um so they're most active at dawn and to ask so that is that's exactly right and that's the time that you really need to be aware they're up and I'm eating men typically and so and they're going to be foraging for food and then in addition you've got these box chase and does all over the place\nUh I've always heard that don't slash your lights at them because they get they get caught in the headlights is a true\nUm I don't think that helps at all and if anything it's\nProbably more disorienting to them to um to have the brain lighten their eyes and then have it be total darkness and then then the bright light back and so um\nYou don't want us to come\nI remember my dad put some kind of like a deer\nType of whistle on my car was like ten Fifteen Years ago and hopes of you know nodded\nWere acting career do those things really work I mean I never really learn and there's no conclusive evidence and make you feel safer I was always a lookout show ever one item on items run into any so dear with those\nAre the concept is that as you're driving and the wind passes through the whistle it makes us silent about high pitched sound to that um is irritating to a deer and so they won't want to cross in front of the car it's a nice idea but there's no evidence that they work for them and so\nThe concern is are they counterproductive by making people feel more comfortable\nWhen and more safe when really they're not anymore with or without andme are\nWe seeing more a deer accidents because more deer population and we're building further and further out into the rabbits are\nBoth those reason yeah we've got as we build farther and farther out we actually build prime deer habitats they love our out or suburban areas or it's\nA metal like lawns interspersed with wood lots that's prime their habitat and so they do really well and then in addition and ... and a lot of communities and um\nAnd ah it's throughout some uh some neighborhoods to we restrict harvest entirely so there is no hunting going on and um there are no natural predators other than humans really left 'em and not major predators right on the landscape\nTo say I and I know I don't certainly don't want to bring you into the into the controversy but it is very controversial over um deer in the country a judge field and they're ruining my yard no they're dear no how can you kill Bambi with Malone I understand that but what about the deer in the communities is getting any better or is it getting worse\nIt depends on the community and you don't have to worry about bringing me into that 'cause I'm already\nI'm\nWell into that and so it depends on the community so you mentioned town and country and they've been able to drop their population significantly with management efforts to about half of what it was a nine years\nAgo where they do do they do the bow hunting\nThey don't have they do they they did do some fertility\nBut one thing they don't tend to have they do they they did do some fertility control for two years early on but I'm really what they do is they have a special permit where they bait and use marksmen to harvest here in\nIn large numbers and then all of that meat I Want to know is donated to operation the charge on that city accounting country dying so all that resource is going to use this as well\nAware where would you say is a place that is not managing their beer population or who\nYou're going to have me call somebody out here I'm\nJust more aware of is there a larger community with their popularity most have west county outside of town and country and they're in a tough spot because they're surrounded by Chesterfield increase core I I'm an unincorporated areas where there's a lot of their stance population\nI'm Out in Colorado and I don't see a lot of deer out on highway and why is that I'm just not looking forward or um drive at the wrong time or\nThere may not be dense populations through there and he came in your yard\nNow live in a small yeah I don't see him at all and normally they eat all your flowers don't they\nYeah and and tomatoes and everything else did they do oh yeah they're and they're rooming and save a chamber and stomach like a cow so they can eat just about any plant material and and they will I mean they show preference for something like your tomatoes and Hafez other things when he knows that there are many\nEbony knows getting getting the big prize I don't know what's going on there I'm Sorry go ahead [laughter]\nSo in some of these subdivisions better developed especially with extensive common ground these would it be a common ground areas they tend to ah see their gear populations grow more so than developments that are kind of house to house to house and most of it as mowed grass\nAny studies done that when you give the deer birth control they're much more promiscuous\nNo a scene\nIn
