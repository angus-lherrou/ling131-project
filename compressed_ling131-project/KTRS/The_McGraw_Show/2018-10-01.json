Gomez joined it ABC News contributor for FBI special agent from Los Angeles good morning Steve ...\nMorning or\nGood can the FBI do a credible investigation by friday on judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford\nAbsolutely they can and they are right now as\nWe were hearing that a potentially would be reopening the investigation I guarantee you that they were setting up a command posted FBI Headquarters amassing every resource that is available all across the country to ensure that ate meat that one week deadline so I I have full confidence that they are going to be able to accomplish that\nWill they be able to get a a good representation of will they be able to at least find out something more than we already know\nWell it's going to be a question of whether they are able to corroborate the allegation that Dr Ford has made against it Kevin and\nFrom what it looks like at least one other allegation that is being investigated or are they going to determine that um they can't decide what the what the information says one way or the other\nOr they may also determined that the allegations are false\nAnd that that there were some flawed memories involved and recalling what the allegations are involved so it it could work in a number of different ways it's just a matter of now when they conduct these interviews with Dr Ford and some of the other people and then the witnesses\nThey may come to those types of conclusion so we have to wait and see but I have full confidence in the FBI given my involvement in special operations special investigation that they conduct where they basically mobilized the whole agency to ensure that work and stuff\nSo that when you talk to the FBI you're not under oath but what happens if you do lie to the FBI end or can you lie to the FBI and or can you say I don't want to talk to you\nWell yes there there is a possibility that they say I don't want to talk to you because\nUm this is not a criminal investigation if it background as to gauge so I'm the FBI does not have the ability at this time to call somebody into the grand jury and even then they they could potentially plead the fifth\nUm you know there could be the potential for um a witness being called into a committee hearing and then they have testifying and you know and if they refuse and the same thing it could also issue some type of immunity\nAnd you know and if they refuse and the same thing that could also issue some type of immunity I mean these are some legal process that you know probably won't happen but there is the potential for them to to say I don't want to talk to you and then it's just a matter of scheduling you know try and make sure that these people are\nYou know available and that but but the fact is it's not like you're sending agents out from Washington DC agent all across the country has been activated\nSure what ... what about an FBI agent come comes to me and I live to be FBI agent can I lie to an FBI agent\nIf if somebody tells an intentional lie to the FBI and the FBI is able to to prove that that is the case then yes I I Believe in this situation that person would probably be charged with like the FBI thousand and one\nWhat do you make of the uh some of these shows uh classmates who were coming in and saying you know what I don't know about anything but\nI knew the guy to be a drinker and a pretty heavy drinker at that is that going to be investigated do you think you know\nI I thought I thought about this as as I was hearing reports and and this is going to be a big challenge because you have people that are saying act\nAnd uh and and judge Kavanaugh did acknowledge that he drank beer he liked beer and that he's still likes beer\nAnd it's sometimes you drink a little too much and sometimes other people um drink a little too much so it's a matter of how to categorize what she described and what the witnesses like say Korea law school or or you know the universe day yeah are you are categorizing and and that's going to be a challenge because you\nKnow you're talking to thirty five years ago and you're trying to figure out how many how much is too many beers\nRight yeah uh well you talked to my classmates back in college they will tell you I had too many beers from time to time but that's another issue\nWhat do you make um um what do you make of President Trump or the allegation that that that that President Trump is trying to signed me the investigation and President Trump saying what are you talking about we're letting them we're giving them a way to do anything\nThey want\nExactly I I don't see in this situation that uh once President Trump approved the reopening of his background association found the FBI at\nAnd I in this situation here there's no way that the FBI it's going to let anybody meddle\nIn this background investigation now with that said I Believe that there is probably a scope for this sort of a Geisha that scope could potentially be\nOne week that they can conduct as much investigation they can and one week period and that may include some other accusers but I Believe that it will also ensure that whatever allegation they investigate must be a credible allegation\nAnd that's a very important distinction because there are allegations that have meat on the bones so to speak where you can investigate and those allegations ... Bible and then there's some other allegation that just do not seem credible and there's a process for ... those types of allegation\nAnd I believe that there are some allegation where they're not even going to contact the accuser and conduct an investigation about one in particular I Would say is the ladies at a ... ...\nUm who's represented by a lawyer Michael Abernathy right there's there's some real questions as the motivation there on that allegation and so so far apparently she hadn't been contacted her he hadn't been contacted and they may never contact\nYou know Steven Gomez for FBI special agent your bottom line is that by friday\nUm [noise]\nI Will have a little better patient\nI think the investigation is going to be concluded by about Wednesday evening\nAnd they are going to be wrapping up the report sometime around Thursday maybe it'll go into Thursday with the investigation that we call the report together by Thursday they'll have to respect\nRight do they make conclusions in these investigations\nNo no they don't they as a number of people upset and I can tell you they're they're interviewing people they're writing reports there may be a summary\nAbout what all those reports are saying and how there are contradictions within those reports but they're not going to make conclusions hang on judge Kavanaugh um you know lied or or judge Kavanaugh you know is is not suitable to be confirmed that they will not make those types of some right conclusion they're going to document\nThis person is at best this person who said that this contradicts\n'em by people said the\nJudge Kavanaugh sit back and then it's going to be up to Congress to decide\nSteve governments former FBI special agent the reserves and thank you for your time so that you very much I was going to twenty seven Arabic five fifty years that was really interesting\nUm well do numbers Lou numbers next year big\nFive fifty eight year without America knew a credit union am eagle CU dot O.

born in thirty eight Nineteen thirty yeah yes so when he was six and this is what people did then he was hospitalized oh yeah for life yeah\nYeah I credit a lot of the parents of the kids today who demand my kid will be treated right away as you work you know um and I also have to give a shout out to a companies that reach out and hire\nA adults teenagers with Down syndrome and we have so many in St\nLouis in St Louis because it is so endearing to um you know go to the supermarket to go to the movie theater to go to whatever and to\nEngage and I I Can't help myself I end up having a conversation with these we moved just just because it's so endearing and it's so nice and that they're so pleasant than there are I don't mean to treat them any differently than it would anybody else but but there are so engaging and there are so friendly and there are so\nHelpful but you end up ... you know you end up making a front\nAbsolutely you know we also have companies in St Louis that higher convicted felons if they've done their time laughing they are bakeries one of them when George Lombardi retired\nWell they had a you know some other kind of their key players wherever rookies and for those guys to go through that last leg of a major league season there's really no way to prepare for it unless you've done it before\nUm and I think that's what you saw here a guy like jak clarity who've been so good all year is going to receive votes for\nSome votes for rookie of the year I'm you know goes out yesterday and gets pounded\nUm and that to you know get him out early it's it's just it's hard and you really there's no way to know how to get through it um now the cardinals the cardinals fan base is not going to be content with that but that reasoning and they shouldn't feel it with this organization prides itself on annual contention on annual postseason appearances\nAnd hopefully more and they they've missed three years in a row so now to me the big question is what is the front office decided to do are they going to\nLet this youth continued to be that the future and continue to go along with their own pace I mean there's certainly some exciting young players on this organization or they're going to try to supplement it with a with some star power now\nAnd try to contend with the brewers tried to contend with the cows because right now the division the cardinals used to own it looks a little topsy turvy and that doesn't really seem like it's going to be flip back in the cardinals favor anytime soon or less the cardinals get proactive about it\nYeah All right so a first let's talk about Wainwright are we going to Seattle when right in a cardinal uniform next year\nWell it sounds like both sides are open to it or to some degree this would be this would not be a big contract that that Adam Wainwright with what happened in order to the one that ended this would be an incentive late\nType of deal um I think Adam Adam right now would sign it today if he could I don't know if the cardinals are ready to go there yet but they're certainly going to have those conversations I think the cardinals bike what they saw from Adam\nBut I mean you know as well as I Do there are a lot of questions there and this team has a lot of a lot of arms or this would this would be more of kind of a\nA maybe you know one more sendoff type of deal than it would be a ... you know big money deal I mean Adam has been pretty candid about the fact that he didn't catch a lot on his last big mega extension that he got so I don't know that he's looking to break the bank but I think he would like to end his career here\nThat said he is also open to the idea of of going elsewhere it used to speak cardinals or bust for him and now I think if if he wants to pitch next year even if it's out of the bullpen and the cardinals say hey you know we're going to we're going to let this be the end that I think he will uh I think he would go elsewhere to pitch here\nUh Marcello zoom you know when we do with him\nGot to get him help demand um it was a concerning somewhat and beat the here\nTo hear that the him and saying that he doesn't plan on having surgery\nI think the answer should be that he plans on doing whatever it takes to get their shoulder right for next season um they didn't have surgery last season it didn't tend to go to well um they've got to get him on if he doesn't have surgery to if there's not a surgery to repair what he's dealing with that kind of a similar to attend tonight is this year and they have to do something to get his shoulder\nStrengthened in rehab because that that that when we saw this season isn't going to cut it I mean he can't grow any Carly swing it got a little bit better if they did the treatment shot through it\nUm but uh but that's not a long term solution I got to figure out some way to strengthen that bad boy up he's entering a contract year right with the cardinals either going to look to resign him or he's going to go make a bunch of money elsewhere he helps\nYeah a Dexter Fowler\n[laughter] yeah good question\nThat's why I said\nI must say like I said that he has a future ear pictures that they see the future where he plays every day to me that's a hard sell 'em you're talking about a guy who\nEvery day to me that's a hard sell 'em you're talking about a guy who\nWas supposed to be a lead off hitting center fielder he had a good year his first year and then the bottom dropped out this year he's had multiple injuries for speed player um I think that's a bad sign and when your feet started getting banged up as a veteran thirty plus player who relies on your speed that doesn't usually end well\nCardozo I'm a ton of money still he's got a full no trade cause there's nothing really the cardinals can say right now other than they want that sort of come back and be a part of this I Would be a little surprised if that turns out to be the case just because I think the cardinals have to look at the end candles here and say I don't know that you can bet on that guy being you're starting right fielder\nThe problem is there really wasn't anybody who jumped up and grab that spot well Dexter has been out\nJose Martinez can hit the end of the season a bad in a bad way off instantly but he was one of the most reliable hitters\nBut his defense is going to cost you in right field just like it is an at first base\nTyler O'Neill was kind of supposed to be the guy who jumped up and took the spot but he strikes out so much I don't know that you can count on him being alive while he's also injury prone to some degree so there really is a big question mark in right field me personally I think Bryce Harper would look great there but you got to figure out something to do with ... ... contractors I don't think the cardinals are going to pay him to go away or they would have done it\nBy now All right now you brought up the sixty four thousand dollar question and that is Bryce Harper cardinals realistically I have a chance to get Bryce Harper\nMean if they want to spend the money sure I'm now ... we've seen them be more aggressive to some degree with offered them in a drunk Carlos ... I think ... some fans say don't it doesn't count because they didn't get him but the money was on the table I mean he's been come here\nWhich to me that the worst thing when you when you match money and right and you and they would have been on the first contract they're willing to take and he just didn't want to come I'm so that they if the cardinals have the money I think they would have a better case for price and I've worked for a child at McDonalds never played anywhere because\nI think he wants to be you know wants to be on the coast I didn't Harper would be a fan of the culture here in terms of baseball being king all year round\nRight I think that would be a selling point with him\nUm he also hits left handed which would be nice for this wide up just ... way way way right handed heavy I just think it would be a star here um but I don't know that the I don't know that the cardinals are or have the um the fortitude to get into that bidding war and when they certainly have the money\nBut they're they're playing usually direct them in a more cautious route and often times it has worked out but we're also talking about as we said earlier a division where there is there's really no end in sight in terms of the cubs rain and not the brewers are are better than ever and and the cardinals are looking to get back to where they belong\nYou where are we in miles Michael is Denise sign a one year Neal\nTwo year deal to year deal thank goodness you are in the winter he wanted a two\nYear deal because he figured they were willing to go more but then he said I Want two years because I I Want to prove that people would I can do and have a have a faster shot at free agency\nAnd everyone kind of said well that's a pretty bold you know you ... you have more years on the table but you want to shoulder deal to get a quick or shot it free agency what looks pretty smart now right on the national league's best starting pitcher and he was dominant again and the cardinals last game that mattered a it's a shame that they couldn't get gotten him another started down the stretch\nWhy how old is he a miles you know he is not a I have to shovel check on that he's not he's not as old as his moustache indicates\nBut he's not quite one of the baby face got run around and said he I think he's about thirty is okay I'll have to double check on that\nYeah he is thirty we our ... year double ... sounds about right and he is so much\nWiser much more mature math\nYes we'll hit him embrace armor good I'm good I'm good to talk about hair care products while they were Bryce Harper\nTwenty five I mean that's that's the that's why this guy's going to make so much money man I mean he is\nHe's so good and he's so young now the big fear at giving ... ... veterans aging players big big contracts big money right they'll give them the money that want to give him big ears right Harper and Machado child twenty six they're going to be some of those few guys that got the major leagues so early they're going to be able to demand bowl\nBecause they have that they have the mile is left the only thing about Harper's he's played so long already and played so hard that you'd probably probably has a body of a thirty year old more than twenty five ... because he's been an elite so off\nWell you know great he's twenty five years five years and I I wouldn't do any more than five years you give them a ten year deal all of a sudden you're paying them to be a a thirty five year old broken down ballplayer\nA five year deal probably won't get you in that conversation I don't even know that eight would I think it will be paying at least right um and that's that's what that's going to be the ... when you make those kind of deals you're basically factoring in losing at least one year\nFor a decline or injury maybe to throw that that that's that that's kind of the unspoken rule and that says you bake in here's where you don't expect the guy to play and you say if I get this value from among these peak years somewhere okay eating this on the back in um you know the example would be you don't even to some degree with extra power\nI don't think the cardinals expected him to be the leader fading center fielder in the fifth year of his deal they would like to get something out of the problem is they're they're they experience like the fifth year that he'll at your in your two and then that concern\nRight well I Want to know where all those cardinal fan demanding the cardinals signed Dexter Fowler were were were those people today\nFor a little quiet are demanding they signed ... that's right well here's my\nHere's my here's my theory though is the cardinals have done really well on on you know low risk free agents who helped him out in a big way but Norris miles Michael is um there was competition there maybe to some degree but those were guys like the cardinals sign that everybody what what right okay look at those turned out\nThe cardinals have struggled where they've made their Mrs are kind of on that middle to upper tier free agency Dexter Fowler Mike leak I think is a is a good example of that um some of the closer we can get some Greg ...\nNobody in these these were\nThese were these were not Markey free agents but they were probably that groups like be less free agents so to me maybe you start going after the ... guys and we'd go blow you go low risk guys and big fish and cut out everything in between 'cause it seems like the in between is where the cardinals were getting Berkeley\nOh well that's a great question and I tried to look up as many soccer metaphor has passed over for speaking you this morning I\nGot nothing you're off sides [laughter] this\nIs just a bad idea that won't die maybe a horror film is a better idea I understand that the people of\nSt Louis would love to have a major League Soccer franchise that would be wonderful that's not the question the question is what is it we're going to have to pay for and and that's always the question now your spouse comes home and says\nLike I bought a brand new car it's in the driveway your first question is oh my God what did you spend and I think the people of St Louis are very a right to be skeptical of what's being asked of them because too often\nUh cities are being asked to cough up tax dollars to support the the the the programs owned by very very wealthy people\nBut at this point we don't know anything about her out of this new proposal is going to look\nThat write the story in the paper pretty much said here's something we don't know anything about so uh you know the the the governor's office says you know where we're at the mayor is confirmed that there are some talks but\nNobody knows if they're going to be any expansion teams we don't know\nWho else is in the running and and of course we don't know where St Louis is in the running so again this seems to be the the kind of thing that the Amazon does to city that Boeing that the Missouri which is the show a little leg and you see a how desperately are we going to fall over ourselves the hand of a bunch of money\nAnd and now now now in ... in fairness you're right that's how it's gone in the past the rams left St Louis and went to LA LA didn't give them a nickel and so stand Rockies building his own stadium that amazing yeah\nIt's it's it's something where the state just donates\nLand or gives them the land or\nRight maybe fixes a couple of exits maybe you know rearrange is a couple of streets maybe some plumbing right um you would be All right with that right\nI Would have to see what the value of that land is and why can't we just sell it on the open market the question is if it's soccer players of athletes and the owners want to make a great deal of money in St Louis if they think it's a good market if they think the expanding there is a good idea while you're taxpayers\nHave to pay the bill why do we have to divert money away from schools and in a way from police last I checked at the state of Missouri in the certainly the city of St Louis heart flush with cash\nRight well yeah but if it presumably they're not gonna give him a you know a land that is invaluable there they're going to give them land isn't very valuable because we know the city of St Louis has a lot of land that's just lying around\n[laughter] ... again it's it's a matter of what is the whole package look like and and the frustrating part of the whole of all these conversations is basically very wealthy franchises are very wealthy a sports teams come to cities and say God\nWe can't afford this of course they can afford it absolutely they can afford it they're going to make all the money on the back and they should say the St Louis is\nGive us a little bit up front to help us with the investment maybe get some taxes regulations out of our way and we'll give you a little bit on the back and we'll give you a percentage that would be at least a better deal with that never what we get flu it does take all the risk and you'll see none of the reward\nWill have to see how it all works out because we're we're again we're both of us are talking out of our our our ears because we don't know what the proposals we're talking about you know a past arguments\nUm so I'm a with that being said two things one of\nThe city of St Louis voted against building a stadium but voted in favor of the taxes to go to the stadium [laughter] yeah so do do they have to go to another vote of the people to build a stadium in the city\nAnd that's a good question I imagine they would have I don't know if they voted for the taxes but not for the particular plant I'm sure there are plenty of very smart lawyers who are working their way through a ordinances in statutes trying to make sure that any money collected goes to the franchises writes ah\nAnd then lastly and this is sort of a a bigger question Patrick to eat because in in theory a I agree with you but I was reading a story over the weekend the Denver is booming right every day there's another story of businesses coming into Denver and these high tech\nBusinesses and all and each one of these businesses are getting tax subsidies from the state government and wild grapes I'm afraid we're not giving away jak sub subsidies were cutting off our nose to spite our face and so\nIt would be good to\nUm to disarm right but you can't unilaterally disarm because other states are they going to steal all your jobs\nThat is it common argument and and basically what that argument is look everybody else is doing stupid things we have to do stupid things too and it just doesn't work St Louis is not going to in Kansas City is not going to be able to compete with Denver they've got a different populations are wealthier they are a destination no matter what we tell ourselves\nWhat Kansas City in St Louis have to do is figure out what are our competitive advantage is what makes us different than cities around us and play up those things but it for trying to spend money like Chicago and New York in Portland in Denver we're never going to win that game\nThat you're doing more on the website show me ensue dot ORG and he

yes the blues start a Thursday and the ... and ... over the weekend they announced that they're going all ticket lists\nYou need to act unilaterally added not get with a gun for it or not\nNow no hold on a second I read the story a number of times because if you buy season tickets so he by half season tickets or the the packages slid gonna give you a debit card\nAnd you swipe the debit card and that's your tickets so they're going to basically load your tickets under your card and then you swipe the card and for each it if you buy for tickets then you get four cards yes we have to tear single player or something right yeah okay now I understand that if you buy single tickets they'll send you an email\nAnd um you can you can have it on your phone and they'll scan on your phone and everything else they also mentioned which is the first time I've read this where yeah you ... you print off the email\nAnd then they they sell the email three or four times so the the first person through the gate gets the ticket but all the other ones are sort of stock\nBut here's what they didn't acknowledge or didn't let's say I buy a season ticket package or I buy a half season ticket package or or the terrorists go plan OK willy and I say to you I Can't go tonight\nI give you my debit card\nAnd then I have to get my debit card back from you\nThat is the only solution I Would know ... to that situation\nRight there is no way to give you my ticket right like like if I were to give away tickets on the air if I were to buy that the plan\nAnd hey I Can't go to night but I'll give tickets out tonight [noise] guess what\nHow how am I going to get that ticket to that person\nWithout giving them all my other tickets [noise]\nHow are they going to give away tickets on the air just take down their their email number\nOr possible that the cart is maybe at transferable with the ... maybe\nI don't know it's a weird up to it's a weird deals so I Would transfer the one ticket to your app Willie\nThat's a weird deal bigger one day on the hill said hey give away for tickets for as game do you tell me [laughter] I don't think we can get them so I was waiting for him [laughter]\nWe got our going to give it away on the air ... that I can go here I Am I got forte it's go ahead and\nTell us your tickets myself or they give them tickets for the show like that are going to ask that question but I\nThink it's really don't exist anymore it's a weird it's weird deals so I don't know\nI like Jim Thomas is a lot here in the second paragraph of you still have a foot blow 'em you're in trouble\n[laughter] I uh I I actually believe it or not actually thought about buying it was very confusing I I went on the line of this weekend to buy blues tickets because I wanted to buy blues tickets because I Want it to support the blues um I wanted to get some type I Can't go to all the other games but I like going to the blues games\nAnd I I I Love Tom Stillman and so I wanted to go and so ... support the blues and become more of a blues band so I could sort of right\nBut this weekend tried to buy tickets it was so difficult they may they didn't they didn't make it easy to buy tickets that's for sure then I read that that that story and I got even more confused [noise] so I Am just to see how that work [noise]\nI don't really need to do that like I just want to see how this
