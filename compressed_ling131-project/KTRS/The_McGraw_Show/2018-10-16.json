like about a week since I've been here ... a year ago it was a year or the exactly a year\nAgo you're you're gonna so big news ... news I waited too um wait till you're here you're going to be filled in for Kelly or this week and next week and then you can be joining us a mother's I have every Monday Fairfax I lock it is very excited call a Joe Haldeman\nIsn't going to take some getting used to though I mean when you're not when you get out of the when you get out of the habit of not use the morning reads already in the morning after doing it for twenty five years\nOver three thirty in the morning show starts with six what are you and for whatever\nI don't think I Need to answer that question [laughter] ah it takes a while ago that said though it's not a team of makeup and hair artists and it still looks like that's what I look if you have any problems talked to management um and um\nThat's what you'll you'll you'll get the hang of it so just yeah I Hope you know I Hope so there\nAre a good heart so what's going on in the world including now St Louis front and center with this rocket scientist woman who\nQuestioned this man walks into his apartment over the weekend\nI saw it and I thought please don't let it be St Louis [laughter] that was my first reaction on on Facebook as a friend of mine posted it and I was just like please please please God please don't let it be St Louis I'm sort of course\nSo this yesterday at some point and the ... started making the rounds on the viral videos we we touched on it yesterday now as a full blown national story and\nOh I think this is global on global\nAnd the national story is well here's another one video of a man living you know I guess what what do they call you know driving while black you know walking while black he was living while black reading breathing breathing going to his apartment while black and that'll get you a call to the police but you know what\nI end up here me out on this she she lost her job she um\nIs now I mean we really we death threats oh sure bullying or I mean she's been right\nYeah the apartment uh we had planned on bringing some of the neighbors on this morning you owned or to save their location and the just the apartment has its own Facebook group or something to that and receiving threats of all turn\nThe whole the whole building now yeah I sure hope builders they're perceived to be racist was of course it's airborne so everyone's effect\nWhere I tried back at the end there you said that they want to stress we did our own the building\nYeah we have we have nothing to do with that building ... close our eyes we don't know but I I don't think\nShe should lose her job\nI think sensitivity training I figured explaining to her look each erosion why what you did was inappropriate right now what's supposed to happen to this woman for the rest of her life she never supposed to work ever again\nNo she's supposed to be how did to the ends of the earth and driven into the ...\nEven ... even the guy doesn't want that demand what happened to who should be most offended by all this is saying look I don't want to and I don't want anything bad to happen to her she should just learn from her mistakes and the ticket\nBut did you get it does that sound kind of disingenuous I don't want anything bad to happen to her but I did pose this thing on Facebook so that now six million people have seen it\nBut I don't want any I don't wish her and ill real I mean you had to know\nIn this day and age as me to instantaneous\nOf voted off the iron and traditions are going to have to change her name and moved to Botswana or wherever\nBut if this was my point whether it's a Roseanne Barr whether it's Kathy Griffin whether it's this woman was next tomorrow somebody does something stupid is the idea to destroy their lives yeah you should never be seen again yes or as a society should we say here's a moment where we should\nAnd then all three of us were fired on the same day in two thousand and five\nI Would start singing the way we were able to do\nWhen we were on the news\nYesterday where yeah I always wanted to get fired with when he was ... and older such America was the only one who was fired was uh my name's\nJohn oddly and how they have that nobody really knows ... works at the radio stations that that doesn't count and that's why we were calling John ... at night\nBecause see I did you have a party where you were calling at night because I got married when they ended the everybody on that night he was the nuclear kind of credit\nRight right right what everybody got fired except John ... we're going to an athlete that night there's always the cockroach and the nuclear winter right there you go wow I just\nWant to hear a big five fifty ... there is news Alice cost a lot of ABC News ... good morning Alex\nGood morning my girl I'm feeling very cock roaches this morning\nI\nThat was directed at you um I don't think anyway All right what Paul said what about this Kavanaugh kid who's in helping [noise]\nWell it turns out to help Republicans quite a lot of new ABC's survey is out and ... there's good news for Democrats of course there's a twenty two point gender gap a women are on fire they're reacting and shift the Andrew dice clay were running for president\nBut uh the other news buried in the survey is that when you look at uh the Democratic advantage it's concentrated in urban areas in other words Democrats are winning by more where they're already waiting when you get to\nThe swing districts in America the sixty six tossup races and they were looking at the lean one way or another guess what the ... they're forty\nSix Democrat forty seven Republican it's a jump ball what does that mean that means that if Republicans have a slim chance but a chance of keeping control of the house\nWell let's go to the Senate for a second I think he's seen as most in a in with Heidi Heitkamp in Nevada and right here in Missouri Josh Josh Hawley was trailing Claire McCaskill by a good three four or five points now it's a virtual dead heat\nDead heat and I haven't talked to a Republican pollster anywhere around the country the past two weeks or hasn't told me that\nThis week survey or better are better than the last week surveys and that's two weeks in a row they're seeing the Republican votes church why is that I think one big reason other than Republicans coming home Donald Trump's America thinks she's done a good job\nThe other reason is for the first time in Kavanaugh they saw Republican stand up and fight the Democratic establishment in Washington and that hadn't happened before they hadn't seen Republicans tough enough\nAnd Donald Trump's America didn't she Just Mayo versus female they saw Washington destroying to good people Kavanaugh and Ford and were repulsed by that show Republicans are now yeah it's not quite as intense but nearly as democratic women\nYou know the other thing about this whole Saudi Arabia could show the story just in terms of pure politics\nIf Donald Trump sticks to his uh they didn't know anything game that's not going to hurt him but if he all of a sudden turns tough on Saudi Arabia that is going to play very well all over the country he's going to look presidential he's going to look tops\nAnd that can only help him in the polls\nWell Donald Trump was pretty good at talking to this is a situation where the U.S doesn't actually have that much leverage\nUh arms sales are the big thing that we have lived with Saudi Arabia and that's the one thing we don't want to cut back because uh we'd rather they do a lot of the work and that part of the world rather than the U.S having to do it\nBut if Donald Trump I think you're right if Donald Trump can talk a good game here while doing things diplomatically behind the scenes to get to the bottom of this will be a plus for Trump\nAll right what what they go back to their house again what what percentage are you putting on Republicans retaining control the house\nI think Republicans have a I stray four out of ten chance now in control of the house\nThree weeks from today is election day and we'll talk to you won that election and to get the latest words ... and every day uh\nNo I'm worried about oil too I mean if we get too involved in this situation oh yeah you know um\nNow it's a it's a sense of mutually assured destruction right yeah but you can't just sit there and have this guy who they sent Fifteen people to turkey with a bone cutter\nAnd then and then sent to you know could be a coincidence I mean honestly I don't know what the restaurants are like over there\nAnd make sure you bring extra wipes and some ... and the\n... the Fifteen gallon trash bag\nWipes and Samantha ... and the ... the fifty gallon trash bag to check you know now they're floating this idea to talk about a trial balloon or Saudi Arabia is now saying I'm well in my at the torture dying of our come to think of it OK okay where's the body\nWhat'd you do with the body why did why why did take eight days for this to happen I'm what you do with the body and where's the body\nI trying to figure out how someone is inadvertently killed during\nA torturing ... during your aren't sure yeah I Know you're inadvertently\nWe you know we it was oh it it was it ... ... and ... we yeah we kill them\nAre working in a little less an hour we're going to go to Istanbul, Turkey inter and talk with an ABC senior correspondent who's got all of this story us want to give a shout out or at least a knowledge Paul Allen passed away sixty five yeah yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma came back it was in remission for\nFor a few years that's why he left a Microsoft at at some point but going back and reading\nAbout Paul Allen and a Bill Gates it's a really interesting story right these two real falling out well I don't I don't know years later how it all shake out I mean everyone seems like everybody has a falling out at some point but um\nThese two nerdy guys\nCame up with this crazy idea instead of having these huge giant mainframes let's have these microcomputers right the personal computer hadn't that name hadn't even existed yet\nAnd they went to IBM and said M ... let's we'd like to we like to make your software and IBM said Mm oh okay good idea and I got back to their office and they were like okay what\nThey sold it but they didn't know what they were selling\nAnd that's when they came up with MS dos\nWhich stands for Microsoft disc operating systems\nCrazy and they invented dos and they went on to rule\nThe world they went on to rule the world right and so they became a they Microsoft was a Paul Allen idea\nBecause it was instead of the hardware the mainframes they would make Mike Rowe software for the micro computer\nSo that's where Microsoft's came up it was a micro for small not the main frames but these microcomputers AKA the personal computer at the laptop the desktop and so Microsoft was Microsoft where inspectors I\nTell everybody because I'm so proud of that the fact that my dad designed a holiday system for Holiday Inn and he worked on those IBM those huge mainframe so we'd go into the office with them and I'll never forget the smell it was it was the neatest smelling the world being around those old giant computers for the oil giant meant\nNeal no no no no the old giant computers and they had the rubber mats on the floor because you'd have to you know roll between yeah yeah he's one of the computers and I just wondered though because Paul Allen Bill Gates and Steve Jobs\nAre we better off now I mean we have the technological advances but I think in so many ways and this is way too deep for the six o'clock hour but I I just think in many ways we've we've sort of falter and as a result of all of this technology\nWould you like to put the genie back in the bottle and then were impossible I I Would accept the just the other day I saw a picture of a woman\nA young daughter having a picture with um Tom Cruise somewhere on the Internet and that was kind of neat to see yeah yeah you know who that was it was some that was me six twenty eight year big five fifty ... no I agree with you\nI if I had to do it all over again I Wish the personal computer and a laptop and the phone was never event and I was okay with the with the laptop the phone is where it spiraled out of out of control\nWhen you see when you see a four year old and and my daughter's ... came in town for a funeral and we were out at a restaurant and we noticed said all of the the families around us ... with the exception maybe one or two tables but the kids were on their phones that parents were on their phones yeah that is just\n... it says ... awful it's awful

a story of a guy who was a doctor in Webster Groves soured sex or\nUm who abused at least seven women as a quote unquote sports doctor\nHe was in the offices of mid county orthopedic surgery and sports medicine um he did all sorts of terrible things to these women and nobody said anything so you go to the doctor because you got to\nPull the end goal of a pulled muscle or bad ankle a rite of this or that whatever else and the doctor ends up doing all sorts of terrible things he and his his specialty\nUh I don't know what it while he's a sports doctor so sports injuries related sports injuries do you know this guy you know our force in sex or forty\nNo this guy no I Do not guilty to multiple charges connected to sexual assault of his patients\nI'm doing all sorts of terrible things kind of similar to what the doctors did to the Olympic gymnasts who never said anything for years and years right here's another example magical magic going into a men don't understand this is

happened and\nThen second of all you want the same thing on the walking out the door\nBut people don't\nWell see I think for years and years we've had this built in um it it's ... it's it's a bizarre mechanism where we don't question people\nThat are in positions of authority you know when I grew up back in you know the dark as stages a doctor you would never dream\nFor a second opinion because

tailoring Jim Cavanaugh got together and are they are going to make another go at uh the MLS team here in St Louis [noise] it was nice to know that one person you had to pour water on the great story\nYou know that's what I Do\nI make people happy\nEach and every day when they're drinking their car and and and eating their cheerios and they open up the paper and they have that great morning and then and then there's me with a cold lasts water just throwing it in their face\nSo they're not asking for any money and they're going to spend four hundred plus million dollars to bring a crown jewel to St Louis what's the problem\nAs well as I pointed out in the column they they are asking for somebody and that's you know I mean the context here\nAnd and the history of stadium in St Louis is always important whenever another one comes up because it seems to me every time we have one of these discussions we seem to cost over\nWhat happened the last time you know we got the call all the history of that now everybody stand rocky well look at the right the first time so that's part of my job here so I bet on\nPaper on paper as I understand the paper that service based on what's being presented\nAnd soccer deal is taking it to get better than the last and soccer Dale because the last guy we gotta have sixty million and local money absolutely can't be done without that bottom line\nThat's our gas bill and somebody else's comments saying no we don't have to ask the voters are sixty million dollars\nTo say there's no money to say there's no tax money is Charlie Charlie something like this week with about looking at the history of the ticket tax because they just get it out one place\nWhere people where I live and people were yelling\nFor soccer fans I Am comment you go to a game and spend money and she was elected on top of our ticket price to pay for services we're helping the city during this time where\nWere you know extra police officers extra trash extra work all of those different things and it's it's\nIn this city\nAnd it's ... it's very complex ticket tax money in most cases to be read it to the owner just worth noting as I get in the column that the history of the chicken and it was in\nTo help poor people\nAnd it's being used to basically help\nIncentivize wealthy people to build stadiums and\nThat's a public policy decision for the Senate and the mayor and maybe the debate but the reality so\nIt's funny and the steel yeah it's a lot of money that they're asking for an abatement from the ticket from I don't know I mean that's why we continue to look at the thing and I think they close attention to detail\nSo a couple of things but one is if you remember new voters\nVoted in favor of tax to build the soccer stadium so that money is already being collected I think it was a business to adults they business tax um but the city and the voters in their infinite wisdom said we want attacks ourselves\nBut we don't want to build the stadium so they're already generating tax revenue that was supposed to go to build the stadium but it's going I guess the end of the general revenue fund and then secondly\nDid the cardinals have gotten rid of their ticket tax the blues and gotten rid of their tickets actually that ticket tax might have been useful years ago but everybody else is sort of gotten out of it you don't want to force the soccer team to pay for it when everybody else doesn't have to pay for\nThings to say that 'cause they're not they're not saying we can't we can't compete it's a self fulfilling prophecy that all of these\nWell the sports teams owners\nUsed against them why people are trying to do that and I gave in Columbus is trying to do that right now they're having little situation where a chain tried to play one city against the other\nWhat happens when you build sports radio I'm staying with your\nIt interesting that you point to where they used to act\nUp for the rest of the cats forward to stop the fate or some other neighbor and as a result of that thing is true\nThat is\nThe way that was created was fire house and the poor people\nAnd we try we try to stay here just for soccer and said no we don't want that money to go for what it was originally intended for I don't know I haven't gone back and check\nThe creative part of that is it being used our was originally intended short\nBut that's why we have to pay attention to these things because I don't think it's good public policy to just say\nThat the wealthiest citizens to get a lot of money to charity [laughter] you know let's let's turn to do a lot of guts or the community we pray that they want to bring together here\nIf it was a lot about what the effect is on citizen the gear for about five years from now ten years from
