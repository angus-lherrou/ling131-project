Instagram for a second because I was reading the story in the Atlantic in where\nNow this adults listen to this this is important\nAll the kids use Instagram right none of the kids use Facebook only the Russian box use use Facebook and more even use Snapchat and wild but they're actually going away from from match up there all using Instagram\nAnd stuff that's the big one and Instagram\nThe platform\nWhere these kids are being abused the worst\nUm many interactions on Instagram are hidden from the parents and the teachers we don't understand the platform\nTheir entire social infrastructure is all based on Instagram the bullying the destructive nature um\nHere's what they said they said that Instagram is the digital equivalents of taping mean fliers all over someone school and you're home and your friends on aside from the hate pages teenagers say most bullies takes place\nOver a direct message Instagram Stories or the comments section of your friends' photos\nMm So Instagram won't delete a person's account unless it's clear bullying on the main feed however the kids today saying look you're not bullying on the main feeds you're bullying on all the other places in\nThis article in the Atlantic said parents you have absolutely no idea how bad the bullying is of your team\nOn Instagram even though you're checking it\nThat is interesting well you know [noise]\nMost parents are probably on Facebook could you ask you know and more and more are joining and stuff\nAnd so I like instead because it's a it's really more than just putting nice photos and artistic photos and stuff like that but you're a black you're going to do anything is and so young and they use it\nIn a different way you know and parents like this magic and they don't understand right\nYeah well you're not you're not a teenage girl in all you ... you you you you pose a nice picture of your co host and it raises for blowing things about you know to\nBe right but the ... imagine if bowling is is all the rage in high school [noise] um and it's hidden but these these kids know where it is the kids all the other kids know where it is [laughter] so it's this secret door to where all the bullying it is going on\nAnd you like it I just want to know what happened yeah I just just tell me what happened I\nSurprised that they don't break it down a little dumbing down a little more\nFor ... but I guess the other one of the I guess they're they're they're talking they're not talking to me the writers talking to other people who know dabbling and everything\nElse yeah but it was just it was it was and that journalists do you ever watch Jim Kramer mad money I Can't watch him\nNow and take the guy seriously because you've got a little sound effects\nOf that what does that mean little hyped for me a little ahead Janet Yellen Johnny doesn't offend goes wrong\nThat they actually say that or does he have like a sound that we as a board you know it's like Frank opinion show for the report and they've got all these sound effects and no [laughter]\nThat's correct that my life was\nAnother reason why I just couldn't watch this is not the shows not meanwhile I'm like I still don't know it gets\nYeah Brad Garrett ABC News crime and terrorism in the morning Brad Garrett give money McGraw All right\nSo let's talk about this a journalist who is a everyone's talking about he he's not an American citizen did do some work for the Washington Post so in terms of\nUm in terms of responsibility for the American government where does that stand\n[noise] well it is you know there is a [noise]\nIn the intelligence community and I some law enforcement to there is a duty to report to somebody ... unless they're your arch enemy obviously um that they're about to be harmed um now\nIt it doesn't appear and you know what do I know 'cause I don't see the intelligence the classified stuff that there may have been some information that the Saudis wanted to grab them\nBut not necessarily kill him\nSo you know the the big noise McGraw about that\nHe's dead I think comes more from the Turkish intelligence service so I don't know what they know or don't know or if that's this talk\nBut um yeah I guess the whole idea of sort of troubling if you don't like the what somebody as saying about you then you kidnapped than than you know maybe take them back to Saudi Arabia you send a specialized teams to turkey\nYou know it really is has sort of a la carte re a flavor to it\nThis is clearly a we don't know what happened but clearly it looks like some line was drawn right because there is some type of protection for a journalist walking into a Saudi consulate in Istanbul right\nOf course and it sets a horrible precedent of\nI mean you can't even walk on the concept of your own country and then something bad potentially happens to you so you know I I don't know it's it's it's it's sort of bizarre as to if you're a goal my goal was to scoop him up and take him back to Saudi Arabia\nI mean I could come up with a bunch that are covert plan than using the consulate as the catch 'em but\nYou know I don't know it it ... I always scratch my head when I look at some of these intelligence operations or kill operation so they look at the Russians I mean I don't know if you get much more ... than what they did in two thousand six and\nYou know several months ago in reference to use and toxins nerve agents to kill people\nWell that's my next question which is we don't know what happened we all ... terrible happened or some type of spy novel happen but\nI mean there are a million different things could have happened and ended ... none of it could have been in the various or he could have been something a ... you know no no state sponsored the action or something right\n[noise] well you know yes of course\nThere were some sort of weird movements of two private planes that flew in then flew back out ... Saturday private jets\nUm you know what is that all of that well let me as you said they may have nothing to do with this but the timing was interesting um and because of camera coverage in and around that consulate\nYou know they never saw an exit\nBut there was the vehicles that accident or an hour or two or three actor he entered so my guess is there something here because the guys at a pretty verbal guy we would have heard from him I think if he were you know ... what\nCan the United states do and do and can they do anything\nI mean obviously they can\nPlay some diplomatic pressure on Saturday the Saudis now that's an interesting ... McGraw because Jared Kushner is really close with the crown prince\nUh and so how does that play into this I don't know um as far as discussions negotiations I'd be surprised based on our relationship with the Saudis that anybody's gonna get punished they may ask questions I assume they've already asked questions so we'll see\nAlso come to the very strange time when Donald Trump keeps telling people that the press is the enemy of the people and then a member of the press sort of goes missing in this ah Saudi counselor\nYeah little contradiction you think you know\nBrad Garrett ABC News crime and terrorism and what's next for joining us a run out of the day\nTake care of her six twenty five year big five fifty a K T R S let me tell you about many knows market because we were looking for\nBoy it's Thursday and what we got tailgate so we got football we got the weather turning nice right all the time to go cook outside but you have to go and get the good quality cuts beef where are you gonna go to get that money knows markets\nAre right around the corner right we've got Thanksgiving stews coming up and and Halloween food and where are you going to get all that quality homemade pies and breads and sausages and all that produce from\nWell you can go and get it from the big box supermarkets door and I guess she'll be fine or you know what you can take an extra five minutes enjoyed the trip to the market when used to enjoy the trip to the market right the small little market now you walk into marketing it's three football fields long you want the mayonnaise is going to you know you have to take a golf cart to get the man is\nNot ... it's All right there it's all just to just um\nIt's just a family market that you wish you had on every corner though it doesn't exist on on every corner but it does exist much drive five minutes it's well worth that drive if you don't drive by it every day Monday knows market great area local produce\nThe butcher shop in the back not only the best cuts of beef but the best the best expertise and don't forget about those homemade pies and yes warm French bread all day long at many nose in caught him on highway ... and mother had money does market or many of those market back on\nPhone from airtime Schneider force blue streak tomorrow we love our beautiful said destroy city invite you to experience has been found\nMarshall street tomorrow we love a beautiful safe storage to invite you to spring Bush has to tell the on three great weekend\nFriday October twelve toward the force trucks with a nice round that on Sunday October the fourteenth during the biggest walk in the sea or twenty secondhand or\nLebanon five destroyed St Francis rock with entertainment food fellowship and fun to be blocked off of the most important in trying to car shows\nAnd I said on Saturday October the twentieth or just for the ... pay raise to try to join the entertainment by the people are chamber ever wish they would pick ball that's a nice family problems on\nSunday November eleventh is a hundred anniversary of arms just handed rule warm on hostilities eleventh hour lovers day on\nThat day patriotic before she was joining people those behaviors but for for a better part of your brain wars for details you\nPass John Candy for Alan roofing and boy they have grown by leaps and bounds a brand new show room breathtaking place out an Alice Phil and they're still taking care of everybody's roofing citing and got her needs to\nTheir locations in Alice Missouri you'll find them in St Peter's end and Casey bill Illinois [laughter]\nDoing your homework since Nineteen Seventy to find them on line at a roofing dot net that's Allan roofing to\nGet a truly truly and you've got a call to clean carpet three one four four to seven Ninety five hundred more truthfully carpet dot com I take advantage of their forum special for just a hundred and Seventy five bucks you had mentioned Katie are rushing to get to room scotch protected aboard an older treatments for free you\nHave any heating or air conditioning issues there's one company you should call ... they've been around since Nineteen fifty and for all of your heating and cooling needs three one Ford nine nine three eleven ten since Nineteen fifty Galveston sons or daughters and sons dot\nCom Lewis se games on the T.

Halloween for [noise]\nMaybe if we just have Halloween or at midnight yeah and I think that might actually work\nAnd why won't go all\nThe baseball game and so the base or after the baseball game ends at midnight then we should be able to have the kids walk from from\nFrom neighborhood to neighborhood house to house ring the doorbell so that they could get free candy for one day you\nKnow that's ridiculous that you could you imagine\nHaving a kid knock on your door in June in a mask and saying a unlike some candy please could you let you call the cops on the guy\nWell first of all because it's not Halloween in jail and the idea\nBut I Would be it's had a\nMatch imagine all year long utilities gives whatever you do don't smoke cigarettes do not smoke cigarettes and then we had a holiday where once a year um we gave away free cigarettes that is exactly we're Halloween is\nNow it is\nYes it is first of all don't take candy from strangers and cancer and walking the streets yeah let me see um having all now that we can ... out\nThere who will not let their kids walk to school because they're afraid of cancer being kidnapped right ... ... a child abductions and everything else by October thirty first measuring it as much candy from strangers as humanly possible\nOkay again\nNigger Randall were originally monkey an analogy is ridiculous because you're like yeah let them create don't have any inhabited you ever tell your child\nIf you had one don't take candy from strangers\nWould you ever tell your son or your daughter the\nWell I don't have a tie understand that al ... hats if you do your mother or father retired don't don't take any from strangers\nI'm sure they did at one at some point in my life and my childhood\nAnd I'm sure at some point if he's got some day you are I ever have a child\nWe would sit them down and saying look if some somebody comes to you and says you know here's candy you know you run like heck home and you say you're you're not my you know you're not my mommy you're not my daddy and try and scream and yell and resurrect you're\nPutting and what we would do you're putting them in a position\nWhen you when they tell children don't take candy from strangers it would be someone who would be cutting out to them and a possible new in them harm reduction and this is Halloween where you go door to door\nYeah and he said paired with candy to strain that lead to get children candy yes to strangers not someone who randomly walked up to them in Iran every street as that one ... burn out whether a dusting killing children every student has\nYeah All right well no no no they were saying your street showing that are on that is not what I'm going to give an poison adult that's not what I'm saying exactly what you're saying I'm\nSaying maybe at some point it was quaint and nice to walk up and down the street and go see your grandmother and your aunt down the street and address up in a nice ballerina costume and get an apple okay but we have taken it and distorted this holiday so that\nAdults drink too massive excess what we do a and then you want to dress up like devil's and drunks and bombs and\nUm go door to door trying to get candy which main while the rest of the year they sit on their duff playing video games\nSo I don't I don't understand\nAnd you have a really I don't look dark version of Halloween ...\nSaid to me I only take my kids to homes where we know okay fine\nI Am a veteran of a number of Halloween so many kids come to my door that I Do not know many so many kids come to my door that their parents are nowhere to be found\n[laughter] this is Archie Bunker this is what was once you you you\nTurn what in a when you have the town they mainly from on hallowed ... little outing into something totally dark\nWhat are you talking about what they say we won't let kids play ball games because we're afraid that someone's going to come at a duck them\nThen once a year a man will come down your should into your house without you knowing and leave presidents don't yeah I Wonder do they have to point a movie says don't turn your\nPoint is I have to drive to Kansas City to play a baseball game on some select team because the kids can't play down the street because somebody might have duck the kids right you can't the kids can't walk to school the kids can't do all this and then one day air let shoved them in as many strangers faces as humanly possible to get free candy\nBut but every every other day in the air duct tape Kenny from from strangers\nYou know here's the

that got arrested for very small things one woman shoplift shop lifted some nail polish Wal Mart\nOr one gentleman who has a traumatic brain injury and and and some mental issues\nDidn't pay your tax bill and and they get harassed but then they put in jail and and the judge sets a bail that they can't meet\nSo now they're stuck in jail they already have if they do sixty days making whatever eventually the prosecutor Compton says hey you want to get out of jail you got to print guilty\nAnd and one of the things that I can get into enough in this piece that part of this problem as our state legislatures and funding our public defender program started these people that are poor that should be having a public defender\nThere often are getting ... and in part because they're in jail on these misdemeanors why they don't necessarily automatically get above what the country so they print guilty\nOn a on a really a minor charge the ... the lead woman that I wrote about where he ... he was charged or shop within twenty four dollars worth of nail polish she guys thirty days in jail for that and then and this is the real quick or they get a bill\nFor their time in jail in almost every county I don't know if it's every one bite in almost every county in Missouri and establish happen in the in the metro areas\nGet charged about forty bucks a day for her time in jail for ... goes to jail for shoplifting about twenty four dollars worth of nail polish\nAnd then she built for Thirteen hundred dollars\nAnd then the judge calls hurting in every month to show that she's parenting and if she meant as opponents or doesn't show up to say I can't afford to pay this much they put her in jail I\nBuilt this one for Twenty one\nAnd then she gets another bill this one for Twenty one hundred dollars so this woman has gotten three or four thousand dollars worth of jail bill and what the law students are saying they're trying to get the Supreme Court just said\nYou can't do this if those counties want to set a public policy in order to charge people for their jail time\nThat's not necessarily the issue but you can't put them in jail for not paying back though it's not actually a court costs it said that and there's a constitutional protection in this country against debtors prison you can't put people in prison in jail just because they're poor just because they didn't pay\n'em a debt in this case ...\nCause it man it's happening\nAll over the state up hearing from public defenders I'm hearing from attorneys back then were writing about individuals in St Francis county\nWho deal with one particular objects Sandra Martinez down there who's been overturned by the Supreme twice now for this sort of grand and continue to do it and now I'm hearing people all over the stakes and yeah it's a problem here too and it's all poor people who are just being\nDamaged tremendously by the judicial system\nSo I don't think anyone's arguing that stealing nail polish from the store is God should be be let off scot free meals but I think the same thing\nGoing back to ... nobody was that were saying that you shouldn't be allowed to be that you should be allowed to drive without insurance all of those things there's a difference between saying some things are against the law what is the over all punishment what is the balance what is the purpose of the judicial system\nBut you know not only that but there is a financial incentive\nFor the town to throw somebody in jail\nSo if it's a financial incentive you're more apt to throw somebody hey I'm going to make money off you if I throw you in jail\nAnd so that doesn't seem very fair if they're making money off of locking somebody up because they're they're a hindrance to society\nAnd they're also specifically taking advantage of people can't afford to pay if you or I were driving through one of those towns and got arrested for whatever for not a taxi driver or for\nFor a speeding whatever nail polish for speeding whatever\nWe would bail out we would find a way we wouldn't be stopped in jail there and we would come home and we would hire an attorney and we were eventually get it taken care of their taking advantage of the poor people who live in their communities who can't afford to do anything else they end up in jail\nSometimes and you know the repercussions they end up getting our kids stay in a way it's set or it's just one thing I talk with each other and this has been a long arm of the state there's this tyranny reserved\nFor judicial system being used\nAs an ATM for cities and counties that can't afford a to exist it's it's so similar to\nThat the situation in St Louis county where we have like you just allergies that they can't possibly afford\nA tax basis of that that they once had\nAnd so they turn to the judicial system to try to raise money this is happening in a hundred and fourteen counties in St Louis for and\nIn the state of Missouri and it's a travesty\nAnd and luckily that the public defender's office after ... ferret is doing something about it he's the one they were hired a this young attorney Matthew a mule is there is now filing these lawsuits all over the county trying to get this occur over the state trying to get the Supreme Court to say\nThis is a horrible injustice and it's got to be done\nIs that the same guy who um got into Jane issues faced a wasn't wasn't a call him for jury duty\nYes yes the head of the the head of the state defenders offices have been there for a few years he's the guy who tried to get Jay Nixon when he was governor to have to take a case\nAs a public defender um to to draw attention to the fact that that the state is not funding that off anywhere near its constitutional requirement said it's still a problem and and now what they're trying to do is work their way through the court system to at least get the courts to to say to these counties\nYou can't keep putting these poor people in jail and think about the repercussions\nWe talk all the time at St Louis about not having enough money to fight crime and and and and all of that part of the problem is that the state here here and all of this money to these counties to put poor people in jail and in prison most tipping is people don't belong in President\nLincoln closed at least one person in this state\nIf we stopped putting non violent offenders who don't have public defenders for it there because they're poor not because they get some in Africa than we took a society\nThat it's not about saying that that that that climate and the crime anymore it's about what can we actually put people in prisons for and who is paying for that cost think about the money you could open up in our state project\nIf we stopped putting all of these people in prison just because they're poor\nAnd you know what's happening and it's not making it a financial incentive for the towns and the government to do it it's good stuff
