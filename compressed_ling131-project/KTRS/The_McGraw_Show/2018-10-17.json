really like pop Warner so but we'll get to that a little bit later on ... and joined this ABC News correspondent at the state department demonic good morning Gunter ... how are you All right so a Mike Pompeo is in Saudi Arabia what's the reports\nSo you're he actually Jeff left a tricky this morning he he's been on the ground in the middle east now for about a day and I have really depressed for answers on the case of this missing journalist Washington Post column as\nJamal ... he uh you know sort of has come up without any answer though at this point he's flying back with\nCommitments he says very strong commitments from the Saudi that they will conduct and support a thorough a transparent investigation but at this point he said this morning to report if he doesn't want to comment on the back he wants to wait for that investigation to play out\nUh we we're hearing the last couple of days that turkey has some audio that there was a couple of private planes somebody thinks there was a bone saw in one of the carry on luggage is\nAh how do they square Saudi Arabia and how do they square we're going to do an investigation when a lot of this stuff is leaking out\nOf the leaks have been just sort of surreal this entire story unfolding mainly through the week and a lot of those have been from Turkish officials who really I think are trying to pressure the U.S\nPressure the Trump Administration\nTo come on board to their side and and to sort of paint the picture here\nOf the Saudi Arabia ... to to not only kill him but as you said possibly this ... you know none of that at this point you know been confirmed and the Trump Administration has more taken the side of Saudi Arabia you heard the president yesterday and in the interview with the Associated Press\nComparative situation actually to his Supreme Court justice not many Brett Kavanaugh\nSaying here we go again with innocent or guilty until proven innocent\nAnd so at this point in time you know there really still not judging either way the outcome here they're waiting for the results of this investigation and while it may seem to many many around the world really that the Saudis must be responsible for this company ... still pumping the brake\nAlso President Trump is sort of a looted and and and and my reading list this right counter President Trump has sort of a looted and sort of thrown out the trial balloon well yeah\nHey it's tragic that one one guy might have been murdered but we've got a hundred and ten billion dollar deal on the table we don't want to clear that deal it was one guy\nYeah exactly you know and and the other thing he has said that was in a U.S you know this was in a U.S lawful permanent resident and I've heard that from some folks within the administration that this isn't really in our lame they don't they don't seem to take a for lack of a better word care about it because\nUh it doesn't directly involved someone that's within their jurisdiction the end of the you're right President Trump doesn't want to spoil that a hundred and ten billion dollar memorandum of intent that he signed with the Saudis ... arms sales ill\nDown the line you know that would affect not only his bottom line in terms of you had to go but also American Jobs on the line\nI'm line in terms of these armed go but also American Jobs on the line and that's something that he continually says\nA lot of people do including Republicans on the hill senior Republicans who really need to foreign policy circles like Lindsey Graham Bob Corker it could be a turning point in us Saudi relations you know it's not it's not the first time that the crown prince\nHas sort of disruptive things in the middle east you remember last year a there was a ... it's actually kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister and hold them off the trip here at the time and this is just perhaps the straw that finally breaks the camel's back for some of those Republican Lindsey Graham yesterday on Fox News\nSaying that he will not step foot in Saudi Arabia until crown prince Mohammed bin Salman goes\nSo what's the next step on this we sit and wait for the Trump Administration to do something you know\nIt's actually that that's where we are at this point um they say they're waiting for the investigation to to reach some sort of to finish the conclusion\nThat could be a wild and in the meantime as you said earlier you know we've got these\nExtraordinary leaks coming out from turkey and I'm sure more of those details will come out now been a couple of outlets are reporting equipment to Wall Street journal this morning that their audio audio that where you can hear Jamal shocked the\nAnswer to count and be killed almost immediately upon entering and so we'll continue to hear these things but you know leak out in dribs and drabs and until until the conclusion reaches end though the district and says they won't do anything\nA kind of an ABC News correspondent I could talk for an hour about this because there's so many different angles to it was only but they're kind of and again at the state department ... thanks where are you a story came out yesterday that they said that he was dismembered with that\nBones or a ... still alive you are they also say that the other thing too as I'm\nPresident Trump keeps talking about this hundred and ten billion dollars that sort of um [noise] that's not a it's not a receipt it's not a done deal there's all sorts of contingencies on that and so this half a million dollar jobs no one knows where that numbers coming from either so I'm ... and then\nNine eleven right we promised we promised every one we would never forget Fifteen of Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and yet we turn around and say oh the Mexican rape is\nThat we don't talk from Wall around Saudi Arabia we weren't talking\nAbout the the Saudis post nine eleven when it was still fresh in our minds and we found out that Osama bin Laden family members right members were were allowed to\nTake off of a a cable Clarence Thomas has somebody in a high place that they should\nAnd and and I guess rightfully so during the election people were apoplectic over somebody some Saudi prince giving the Clinton Foundation some money to find out now that you know Trump is has had close financial ties with the Saudi Government with the princes all throughout the last Twenty years\nWell I think if you are a person is means if you have been successful in business at ... at that level of course you've had\nSome ... you you've had ... with the Saudi royal family but what I Love that man and Lindsey Graham God love and we saw during the cabinet hearings and he was no longer a senator from South Carolina he was Rambo right I mean he says well it's very fiery but he's ... he was saying he's got\nTo go a prince is out in the crown prince some I ate he'd sit crown prince or does he think do you know they're not gonna they're not going to send him into the salary they at the consulate\nWhile you're in front of you have a president of the United states that has financial ties\nUm and close financial ties hundreds of millions of dollars with this country which is now a a a accused of murdering\nJournalists as they walk into an embassy in a different country well now I mean how how can a how can any individual separate hundreds of millions of dollars of business interests and the interest of the country he's running\nA weird place to be in a specially when half of the country was complaining that Hillary couldn't do it\nRemember when that was it George W. Bush or George H W. Bush was at forty one or forty three I there was a famous photograph of him holding hands with one of the kinks out or whatever his name was and everybody was so you know kind of taken aback by that\nAbsolutely there's a there's a company called ...\nAnd then you will live yeah mhm so it's pretty clear Netflix's more new economy consumer economy five yeah there's more the old economy there great new product watching but still the company is more old economy\nAnd they both reported hurting after the market close yesterday idea will be awesome today because their earnings were disappointing [laughter] um what should be very very strong early in the day is like the numbers like quiet\nVery very strong earlier today as they think numbers like quite a bit um [noise] so it just\n... what's taking place between the two economies\nYeah Ali I'm Sorry I didn't mean to cut you off there\nNot just the two economies whether it's a Netflix or you know service with pizza or [noise] you know home delivery or where consumer economy much more than we used to be\nYeah and that was a lot of people bad mouth that Netflix met with that subscriber base in those ten dollars and Fifteen dollar a monthly fee is coming in every month that is a great business model right they're they're bringing in millions of dollars\n... billion perspective last year this quarter they may twenty nine cents a share market Alice we're predicting sixty cents to share it made a DUI wow\nTwenty nine to eighty nine that a lot of gross\nThat is a lot of gross um imagine how much they make if I stop giving up my password on my neck Netflix account getting I'm getting I'm getting a U.S bank what did they say\nThey had excellent earnings report it also and that was about thirty minutes ago just the sporting um quarterly profits up Seventeen percent revenues increased as well I talk with your all week about\nThe good earnings report by the bank Trump last friday from Monday here's another big bank report and good earnings what's interesting when you look through the numbers they're not performing at that decreased\nBy Nineteen percent so that's a good sign for them it's a good sign for eight out of the economy\nMm All right you have a note here us back on top of the most competitive economy in the world explain yourself\n[laughter] I've had that quote before explain yourself to leave anytime you left the economy on top of the world\nThe world Economic Forum right the economy is a hundred and forty countries we're not there and the top economy since Nineteen I'm Sorry two thousand and eight so it's been ten years\nUm we were rated number one single for Germany Switzerland Japan right behind a\nCandidate was twelve and this is the interesting when China was ready to twenty eight ... ...\nAnd you know I think most of us know us as really had to pass the economy in the world but they're rating the most competitive and competitiveness to remain one of the best show innovation freedom of movement in income inequality being future ready sustainability\nA labor market practices ethics transparency call they won't go into the rating it's good to just be on the top the top all the way our number one a lot but it also is as much as China's growing and when we talk about them\nSee them all the way down to that want to get any kind of seeing with\nSustainability labor market practices ethics transparency where certain countries lack as well\nSo basically what you're saying is you can bad mouth America and the economy and everything else but remember where the best in the world\nWe had a lot of good things happening here yeah I'd like Thomas markets today how do they look\nIt looks like a start down about a year Ninety points um ...

I said I have is Memphis red birds Bible has really wow yeah uh I also I think I have an ...\nMemphis red birds bubble had ... ... ... doesn't have that a man that he should be about ...\nLong story short I know I Know and it's meant to show that hair Adam Kelsey\nEnjoy this ABC News local correspondent talking about the polls three weeks from yesterday is election day couldn't get here soon enough Adam Kelsey ABC News political correspond thanks for joining us hey thanks for having me All right so I heard somebody say uh the other day\nThat Beto O'Rourke in Texas has a whole lot of energy in his in his base unfortunately has base lives in New York\nI I think that you could certainly say that\nOr work has gotten a lot of support from around the country now that's not to say that he doesn't have the support in Texas as well and we've seen some polls that happened within single digits of of Ted Cruz down in Texas but if you take a look at the fund raising the better or worse than thirty eight million dollars over the course of the last three months [noise]\nOdds are that that's not all coming from Texas so he's seen as a democratic rising star uh people are opening their wallets from California out to New York as you said um but that doesn't necessarily mean that he's not going to be able to drive people out to the polls in just under three weeks\nWhile it sounds like a Ted Cruz is starting to to pull away a little bit\nYeah he's looked a little bit better in some of the polls that we've seen in recent weeks and and things got a little bit ugly last night to beat it again\nOr down in Texas Ted Cruz really portrayed Beto O'Rourke as as a member of the Democratic establishment he basically said that you know shouldn't believe all of the campaign talk that you're seeing from him ah you know don't get sucked in by him riding a skateboard through water burger parking lot as we've seen a couple of times\nUh and Ted Cruz basically saying that once he gets to Washington as a member of the Senate ah he's probably just gonna fall in line with with Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Democrats\nYeah ... uh the national peace talk about Texas they talk about Nevada they talk about Heidi Heitkamp a\nThey seem to gloss over the Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley race here in Missouri apparently this is neck and neck\n[noise] it it's going to be extremely close and I'll say this about Claire McCaskill is that this isn't\nHer first rodeo you know she's gone through close races every single time she's run this is her third in a row Josh Hawley a good candidate another one of these young rising stars this time in the ...\nIn a row Josh Hawley a good candidate another one of these young rising stars this time in the Republican Party\nUm but I keep bringing up fundraising because it makes a big difference in the in these last days of the campaign and Claire McCaskill reason thirty million dollars over the course of this election cycle Josh Hawley just eat point five million dollars\nOr something to scoff at there but you know twenty two million dollar gas is part of the reason why Democrats feel as if McCaskill may be okay or that that's not to say she's a lock by any means a necessary but\nAh you know that twenty two million dollars extra as far as getting her on TV on the radio to get our message out there are certainly helps\nYou know that shocking I Can't believe that Josh Hawley zone a hard time raising funds the whole time I find that shocking if this is such a a nationally watched race that he would have a hard time raising money\nI mean he's still is relatively new to politics I you know that attorney general election or was his first real foray into things I'm so sometimes it's about kind of building up\nYour brand and for Josh ... donations may have come from within Missouri but he may have a tough time attracting donors from outside the state which sometimes is a necessary evil like we talked about with better or him and that in that respect McCaskill more of a name brand\nThere Adam Kelsey let's leave the house for a second and stay in the Senate I haven't heard that the Senate could go anywhere from fifty seven Republicans all the way down to a Democratic Senate\nYeah we were seeing a wide range of possible outcomes here in the polls have been inconsistent ah and you look at some of these states where are you know you would have thought Democrats never had a chance a state like Tennessee for example were Phil Bredesen is really running from the middle he said he would have voted for Brett Kavanaugh he said he would sit down and meet with Donald Trump\nHe's been able to attract some of the Republican and some of the crossover voters there in Tennessee Democrats feel optimistic about that on the flip side you know there are still a lot of Republican red leaning Donald Trump states out there where there are Democratic senators\nOr that we can see flip you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota a little bit earlier Jon Tester in Montana is another one Joe mansion in West Virginia these are all rock solid Republican states\nThat have crossed over to vote for Democratic senators in the past and when you talk about as many as fifty seven Republicans perhaps uh in the next set it a lot of them would be coming from those states\nYeah uh what about the house what's the latest on the house\nWe still see the houses as most likely leaning towards Democrats or we we partner with a recall the nerds at five thirty eight who do their forecast they give him a big if the Democrats a six and seven chance of winning control the house one in seven chance of Republicans\nKeeping control and whenever we talk about these numbers people think six and seven that must be a lock for the Democrats but\nYou know if if I told you they're seven doors and there was a million dollars behind one of those doors you might say to yourself wow I got a pretty good chance of winning a million dollars so they're still they want us to one in seven chance Republicans keeping control as far as five thirty eight says uh so it's certainly not out of the question\nI just won the record I Would pick the door with a nothing behind it [laughter] it's just just shows you're my luck Adam Kelsey have you seen those political corresponding for checking in\nDriving me All right now a Heidi Heidi a Wendy

the morning Dr Michael em good morning how are you hungry so uh there's been a story that's been sort of um making its way through the news of the last couple of days and weeks I guess last week or so backed um there's a some polio\nLight disease or virus or sickness that it's working its way through it seems to be hitting kids and it started in Minnesota but now it's going and uh being being shown in a number of different states what's going on while the update a\nA came from the CDC and this is the CDC job is to monitor dry or things like this is is a a new illness not known before a polio like a affects the the spinal cord and to\nResults in some paralysis especially the upper extremity soon a CDC updated instead sixty two confirmed cases this year in the United states or and they've been tracking this since two thousand and fourteen\nStates are and they've been tracking this since two thousand and fourteen or then locally apparently there's one confirmed case in St Louis area\nA there's a lot more cases in Illinois but they're all in northern Illinois there is no confirmed cases are sort of in Illinois closer to the St\nLouis or when they say polio like\nWhat do they mean by that it means that say a a disease which attacks the neurologic system of the nerves and so all of a sudden you don't have the ability to use\nThose cables to control the muscles and so you lose that and then all of this and you can't you can't use your arms is showing up in kids it is showing up in kids that's part of the the diagnostic criteria now is I think this is a a illness that are kind of\nLooks at Eighteen year old folks are younger uh\nProblem is and the scary thing is there's no known cause as of yet\nOh they've tested all of the known cases for actually polio and turned out that there is no actual polio in any of these so the\nThe polio vaccine itself still I think remains good and true to the test meaning the polio has basically been eradicated for the most part of but this is possibly a complication of another virus and so there and\nYou know common colds are caused by viruses there at new viruses are intro viruses are names\nUh some of those viruses we know from a heart standpoint or more closer to my business\nCan attack the heart and can cause severe problems from heart standpoint called market is\nIt possible uh but not confirmed that some of these viruses or a certain strain of these viruses might attack the spinal cord\nAnd uh end up with this type of condition um they're putting in a lot of resources in it uh they've put forward a updates for conditions and hospitals diagnostic criteria if you see a case like this is the samples we want running a bunch of tests to try to track down what's causing this is it\nPermanent or do you regained your your motor functions after awhile\nUnfortunately as of right now it looks like that's permanent really a motor functions or her not coming back when\nYou say polio like I Know you just said that they didn't test it tested and it wasn't polio but there are kids who are not getting the polio vaccine for certain reasons and we know that some viruses mutate so any evidence of any of that having to do with this\nWell I think you'd have to uh get to live the concrete like bottom line answer from that from the CDC but as far as I can understand from what they said earlier this week\nUh this isn't a polio type virus and so nothing it was it doesn't the only thing that has to do with polio is that the syndromes and and the symptoms have some similarities but it only affects the upper extremity so that's a little bit different yeah\nUh yes viruses mutate so certainly the to viruses that I named to add new virus and the ... virus\nThese are these are viral strains and a highly possible that there's been so mutation along the line that allows them to kind of a hone in on the neurologic system and the spinal cord\nI grew up in a world where we didn't worry about polio polio wasn't in our wasn't in our\nConsciousness was polio or is it or was it\nCould you catch it from somebody else was it like a common cold where you had to stay away from people with polio\nWell it was a virus and uh the the spreading of of viruses varies depends on the particular virus or a but the ... there were polio epidemics where it did spread and there were a significant outbreaks where large groups of populations came down with it and this was pretty devastating\nAnd so the advent of the polio virus was one of them are dead vaccine for this virus was one of the first\nUh to come around as a vaccine to really\nBe proof of concept of what we really can take a serious infectious disease a virus and and kind of basically\nPut our shoe on top of it and squash it like a bug and and it really work as phenomenal concepts are proof of concept and we've been waiting and looking for every time now how many times you hear\nA well maybe there's a vaccine for this condition or maybe the vaccine for that condition or about a decade ago there's a concept of\nAll we can we were going to work really hard at a vaccine to come up to treat HIV and then keep moving forward right among other aspects of so you know that there there is a great story and the polio vaccine it really has worked um\nThe this a diseased state that we're talking about right now this is in its infancy we don't ... before you can come up the vaccine you have to actually come up with the specific cause right so it's not just that type of virus it's the specific one and how it actually works and then you can targeted or to be able to try to\nSort of all we know is that it's a virus but now we don't know they don't know that that's\nThe leading at the leading theory\nA we actually don't know it's a virus or could be an environmental toxin or it's possible you have to throw in there is some sort of genetic predilection to getting us as well uh\nUh it seems to happen only kids so what's different about or maybe the immune system or the growing nervous system of young adults and children are I think there's a lot of things that are wide open and again that's why I say this is a little bit scary because we're way more questions than we have answer right\nYeah um but as of today sixty some odd kids have been diagnosed sixty\nTwo in the United states this year a but there's about six hundred and some cases since two thousand and fourteen around the world ... ah you know just in this kind of just in the ... he's been tracking it in this country while ah so he could get on the CDC website they can give you the table\nNumber case into those fourteen Fifteen sixteen Seventeen and so foreign aid\nDo they have a name of it or they just keep calling this polo full you'll like we'll have a name\nFor you can go the polio like illness or for now until we find a real cause for it and and be able to give out specific information uh that everybody wants like well how can I avoid it right or in in what what can I Do to prevent my kids were getting these are important questions but unfortunately we do not have answers to\nLive from the studio by fifty immigrants you on the\n\nCity is in half which every single
