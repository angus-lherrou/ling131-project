brick cabinet controversy done to the polls going forward\nAll I think we're seeing it both ways certainly Republicans in red states are invigorated those red states where there are a Democrat incumbents are running for reelection we're seeing it a particularly in North Dakota where senator Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat\nOr do a lot of attention for her decision to vote against Brett Kavanaugh said North Dakota race and basically an seeding Heitkamp as as played a major role I'm Joe mansion on the flip side Democrat in West Virginia he voted for Brett Kavanaugh which Republicans appreciated\nBut they're still saying that they're going to try to unseat him anyway and then on the Democratic side I think there's just a lot of the same um you know ... with what's going on in

T. R. S. we have carved out the time for a Jim Cavanaugh\nWho joined us to talk\nA little soccer I was making the joke earlier and my long running joke about soccer is that no one really knows when the game ends because the time runs to zero\nAnd there's one man who keeps running back and forth in the field the referee who's keeping the extra time and many of injury time and they have extra time and just arbitrarily somebody just blow the whistle and then the game's over\nVery similar to what's going on here in that the soccer stadium and the soccer team even though the time ran out Jim Cavanaugh seems like we were in extra time and or injury time and\nYou guys got the deal done at least put before the whistle blow\nOut that way that game some of the game was out of all was still in play and we're still\n... some people thought the game was over but uh the ball was still in play and we're still a\nWorse still work that hard to make this happen so I'm a very good about it actually feel better about it than I ever happen\nWell first of all congratulations give us a sense of how after the city will say oh they know you guys literally did not have a plan B ... you said you didn't have a plan B and it seemed like it was as did as could be how did you get to this point\nSo you're spot on we didn't have a plan B I think a lot of people thought we did uh we did not and I will tell you the plans pretty much one storm it and\nThere were there really was a whole lot of talk you know it at that point you know it was something I was still very interested in the only thing I I even as we walk through the vote\nAnd going through the entire process before but not only is this is a great opportunity for\nUS Soccer fans of St Louis that this was a great opportunity and very important to St Louis\nSo that being said uh you know Andy fall me as just a basically say they want to get together and catch up over lunch you hear more about you know soccer what what's his name alas what is it really mean what do I what do I think it means to St Louis and\nWe we sat down I Walk them through the numbers the challenges and that's why I think it would be important and uh you know that was probably a hundred and twenty days ago or so from there we\nContinue the dialogue got together again and uh I always say in a fairly short period of time we came together and said hey this is something that\nWe need to do something we need to figure out if something St Louis need and it's\nIt's a line so well with so many other positive things that are going on with St Louis so that's kind of fast tracking a lot of different things to get through that process uh I'll just tell you that\nYou know we met with the governor her you know a couple of times with that with uh the mayor multiple times and and their staff they go through the county executive board of ... different people on the board of all the men\nAre went up and visited with Don Garber the commissioner of animal that is an executive management skills so\nA lot of things going on behind the scenes that we wanted to make sure that we did a a a more than reasonable job from a delegate perspective before we came out with anything pop up so we feel pretty good about where we are\nIt sounds like the governor and she needs to be in on this I Know you're short on details and I'm sure the details will come in in the future but it sounds like however the deal is structured you guys taking on the overwhelming majority of the costs\nThe governor and to be in on it end agree with this to help him move forward\nYou know ... there's a couple of things that I've heard a few comics that you had on a year earlier show which I find quite entertaining but\nOverall we need you need the political leaders to be supportive of this effort and from general stuff being more progressive and understanding and supportive of the economics of it so\nTo check to have the job and are supporting us absolutely a critical piece and then\nAlso having the governor and a staff supportive figuring out a win win a from an economic perspective and that's just simply how do we convey the land and if anybody is saying the land today\nIt's basically a blighted areas that that can be so important in instrumental in sort of just the ... what's going on downtown so\nSo you need the governor support you need their help verbal late to promote this but you also need to help with the ... the land top so we feel very good on social point\nYou know I'm I guess you don't need another vote of the people from the city because you're not asking for any for any subsidies right correct\nThey only the only thing that we're doing you know last time that it would be a a a city wide folks that are voting with tax you know the

within the community is we've had Ferguson right I mean we are\nWe've had a really bad couple of years in terms of a public relations and also just a real psyche right we we could we lost the rams we

story\nBecause voting is coming up here in all other\nUh Taylor Swift can we can we can we can we stopped giving Taylor Swift all this credit for signing registering all these people to go vote in Tennessee there now saying\nSix she's got ten million Snapchat followers and sixty thousand people have not registered to vote since she well yeah OK how many people were going to go register to vote anyway because it's the last couple of days before registration so the fact that two thousand people registered to vote on the last day in Tennessee is not\nTaylor Swift fault\nSammy Hagar to St Louis and get out there and do you think the numbers will go up around ... ...\nThe sort of semi hegar to St Louis and get out there and do\nYou think the numbers will go up around ... ... well\nAt the same ... same reach with no but but but if San Diego or did it the day before it would be like on April fourteen it'd be like hey uh San Diego says pay your taxes and I guess what all these thousands of people pay their taxes the very next day you know they were people were already registering to vote any way\nThey and they they knew they had to fill\nWhatever day so can we hold off on that\nWe hold off on blaming are giving credit to Taylor Swift for having the world's\nRegistered to vote I don't think it's from Kate Brown what's been going up later today on the issue so we'll we'll stand by for now this call county judge that has ruled\nThat I'm part of the election voter id law is unconstitutional is really\nVery confusing so they they have said that um [noise] when you sign you go and you have to have a photo ID picture whatever right you go in you show your picture you vote you don't have a picture ID\nSign an affidavit saying I don't have a picture ID under penalty of perjury\nAnd then they allow you to vote so I've read the story three times I'm assuming that I'm reading this correctly the fifth time and that the rule now says you don't have to swear that you don't have a photo ID I guess you just have to say I swear this is who I Am\nRight so if you if you have a driver's license and you don't have it there\nRight now you can swear you can say well I don't have a photo ID because you do have a photo ID you just don't have it on you or you up at home the judge is saying\nA ... you can't or\nYou can still vote and so have a photo ID but I guess when you're signing to say I don't have one on me\nSo I don't know if it's I don't know how big of a deal that is um because if that's the case then what's the point of having a what's ... what's the point of having a photo ID anyway okay I don't I have a photo ID I go there I leave it at home All right let me sign the piece of paper saying I don't I don't have a photo ID\nWhich is kind of what you do when you when you register to vote anyway are you saying I Am who I Am so I the whole thing is pretty pretty convoluted either so I Need a little fall out on this um [noise] but the law the ruling by the Cole County judge keeps the law intact\nBut that there's this\nPhoto ID part of it it's very confusing we've got to get we got to get a gotta get an expert on on that one nine fifty or a big five
