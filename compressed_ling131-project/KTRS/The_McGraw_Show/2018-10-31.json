heartbroken for that family as well we can't believe our sons were involved in this\nTell the community or we gave dot dot the art sons and we did everything we could and ... one of one of the coach was uh every time something happens like this people say where where the parents I Want the community to know we were here\nWe were helping we were helping these what we were in their lives\nYeah and and she is she's not denying\nNo no you know she is saying I'm In disbelief yeah\nShe is not denying that she thought they were thought they were going to school that day\nDidn't know that they had stolen a car or\nA they got in trouble I guess a week or two later or two weeks ago and I guess she brought the wrath of God down on them and tried to scare them scared them straight or something and from all kinds of purpose she saw them earlier in the day and they thought\nThey were going to school thrive yeah and she said they they fell into the wrong crowd and one thing led to another and they did something really stupid\nIt just gosh so heartbreaking so yeah it's so heartbreaking and the decisions that they are making\nWho think they are doing the right thing and\nThen she also said um she said when I saw the boys when I when I saw my son\nSubject to the jurisdiction there are a number three are citizens of the United states so born in the United states subject to the jurisdiction thereof and if you have those two then you're a citizen the United states\nAll of this kerfuffle McGraw\nThe entirety of it is relating to the second part\nSubject to the jurisdiction there are and the the argument that you you hear all attentions making and and scholars making is that\nMother who come to the United states and our non citizens and then have a baby here\nThey are not subject those those mothers are not subject to the jurisdiction\nOf the United states and therefore the fourteenth amendment does not give that new baby what is called birthright citizenship\nUnfortunately for the supporters I'm of that of argument the United States Supreme court a hundred and Twenty years ago my bra decided a huge chunk of it in the park case\nAnd want the arcade says was a young man I'm born to Chinese national parents who are\nHere they were here legally they were dome asylum and they were working in California or in the United states challenged that their babies citizenship and the United States Supreme court ruled\nThat if the parents were here in the United states when the child was born and they noted that they were here legally and were dome asylum\nSit that child as a citizen\nShow maybe a there's a sliver McGraw that one could say well the Supreme Court didn't decide the scenario if that non citizen is here illegally well perhaps and that's why we have court\nBut I think um we lawyers like to refer to the phrase and we talked about in the cabinet hearings settled all I think if if\nThere's anything close to ... law in our constitution today it's probably birthright citizenship pork raw\nWhile that's where you are wrong 'cause there's nothing settling about the current current world so a strike one regret Willard hum I find this quite interesting coming from a president who was talking about\nA ... a just a a nominating a strict\nAnd about ... just a\nA nominating a strict constitutional is to the Supreme Court and then just less than a month later come out and said that he can arbitrarily changed the the constitutional whenever he wants\nWell I I think Justice Scalia would be a God rest his soul would be having heartburn this morning for just that point but I think\nIn fairness of I'll Try to look at both sides quickly in fairness to the president and his supporters I think what they would say is the phrase subject to the jurisdiction there are\nThat's not clear that's not a manifesto on its face what that means and therefore I as the president can issue an executive order to the Igs the executive branch to interpret it\nA certain way to exclude a certain people from birthright citizenship well\nHe can certainly issue an executive order McGraw but but there's a fundamental principle that the EU and Kelly and I and and our listeners talked about and eighth grade civics class\nAnd that is this at the end of the day there is one branch of the federal government\nThat decides the interpretation of the constitution\nAnd it is not the president\nDid it surprise I also find\nI find it interesting Greg Willard that um the strict constitutional is the the skull e a a lead lawyers or this morning apoplectic over this right a president's\nClaiming some type of privilege he doesn't have to rewrite the constitution 'cause if they can rewrite this he can he can sort of reinterpret anything he wants from the constitution\nI think part of the uh the the silence if you will McGraw is now I think most scholars most a strict as you say strict construction as a see this for what it is\nAnd it is not a genuine issue to revisit the question of birthright citizenship\nThis was right up there McGraw with the ten percent tax cuts that he announced was going to be implemented the\nBefore the election he announced last week and Congress my God is not even in session um and so I think I think most people most the scholars are seeing this\nAt this time for what it is and that's great political fodder\nBut presumably he's going to carry forward with it he's going to issue an executive order but again I think we can we can safely say on a Wednesday morning that executive order is not going to purport McGraw to rewrite or cancel the fourteenth amendment\nI think what it's going to say is this is how my administration is going to interpret that clause subject\nTo the jurisdiction there up there will be an immediate lawsuit filed and I predict that at some point a court and perhaps the United States Supreme court is going to say too bad Mr President with all due respect your executive order is flat wrong\nAnd that a birthright citizenship means what it has met since it was a split in the constitution and Eighteen sixty six and it means what it meant since we already decided this once in Eighteen Ninety eight but it's great for the talking heads in terms of political fodder but the uh\nThe pillars of the fourteenth amendment ... are not being shaken\nBy what the president has said\nUh you know what's interesting is John McCain was born in Panama I Believe with his father was on assignment in Panama hum\nA Ted Cruz I think was born in Canada actually um his father was a citizen or the mother was a citizen but he was born in Canada so that's when they say naturalized right is that what they mean by your parents or overseas or and the child is born you're still a citizen\nThat try McGraw there's there's a there's another way for citizenship and is the one you just mentioned in that\nAre in addition to birthright citizenship which what we've been talking about of Congress under article one section of the constitution has plan or a power to set the rules of naturalization how you can become a citizen otherwise and so whether it was John McCain Ted Cruz or millions of our fellow citizens\nThey probably um if they were born abroad they then a obtain their United States citizenship through our naturalization laws and some people I I guess in theory you you\nAre a citizen by birthright citizenship and naturalization but either one is sufficient to give a person in the United states for the trip across\n... get back to work and a leader going on and we'll all at a moment's

is probably more serious than than all of them and that is how do you found out that the parents stealing their trick or treating a candy from their kids\nYeah ... interesting study and I are actually you are in our most demons and we have no qualms apparently uh having our kids to go out and collect trick or treat candy and then ah airing can you tell them to take her ourselves as so\nThe implication that that I kind of want to get to is you know Halloween you go out and you see the stars are decorated following for a while but also the Christmas decorations up either she Thanksgiving around the corner with all\nThe trees are turning colors and as to how he eating season and so uh it's time to actually start paying attention a little bit and preparing for this or that so we're not a ten pounds heavier come July January second has has potentially happen\nMost parents and I could be wrong but don't\nParents take the candy that the kids have and they kind of attack it away so they can kind of give it to them and you\nKnow so they can keep it for themselves and get it once or one or two but don't let them eat at all it why don't they kind of that\nPart of the things Kelly I think that you're probably our best practices number one and you want to make sure that kids don't uh [noise] uh you know court themselves with a whole bunch of candy or there's that great concept for my parents standpoint on that that candy hire the sugar high to get on\nSo from a parent's standpoint on there that candy hire the sugar high to get into it and they won't be in bed and go to in the morning a that's that can lead to make sure that the packages\nAre all a field and there's not been done a from a safety standpoint with respect to what the kids have gotten in their trick or treat pacts um fortunately\nUh some of those things happen over the past few years and so we want to make sure that's fair I mean even more importantly to is sometimes two children are are just so I'm allergic to peanuts you got to look at what the weather's any peanut butter and here are not a bar\nOr would not be a good thing for for that you know a him so make sure that\nThe food is safe and appropriate for the kids as well as the right questions that's good uh but I guess that parents during their candy from the kids and we all have a sweet tooth I'm I'm definitely\nGuilty of that or we just want to make sure that we're doing this for moderation and that would encourage kicking the advantage of exercising are starting to get on that bandwagon or whatever you know New Year's resolution turtle who's way\nDr Michael limb a world class heart surgeon um with this explosive new study parents stealing candy from their kids for Halloween Dr thanks thanks for the great insight we'll talk to you next ones that\nAre you guys are great and take\nA survey of two thousand adults one thousand parents in one thousand non parents commissioned by crashed ...\nSaid that adults steel one fourth\nOf their children's candy at Halloween the one thousand non parents yeah\nSo it must deal the kids and their nieces and nephews that given that\nCandy I don't know why you have a bowl of free candy right in front of you why leave with a bowl of free candy to go get out and get other candy from somebody else that that might be tampered with\nNothing of this holiday makes any sense to me\nYou know when you when you do you\nPresent it that way yes you have tons of candy at home so why are kids go off on\nThere was nothing about the holiday that make any sense to me\nLet's dress the kids up in a costume that they can't see cars can't see them and have them walk through the streets of the neighborhood or go get candy that might be tampered with after four years away and everybody

J. English you know more about Whitey Bolger then then then Whitey Bolger in so many different stories and and but uh I'm a tell me the story of how did you become a\nA guinea pigs to to take LSD what does what does that story\nThat's a that's an interesting one I done a lot of interviews this morning you're the first one to ask me that I mean there's so many interesting\nSide Story took a career Whitey Bolger water but was that when he was imprisoned in the\nBank robbery charge he was a man in his twenties and he was put in prison a federal prison in Atlanta Georgia and there was the CIA and just kind of a secret\nProgram called M. K. ultra nobody knew anything about where they were seeing the effects of LA she was the idea of using the somehow I'm\nAs a true sir I'm of sorts and they use in weight in Britain as guinea pigs they gave them the opportunity\nTo submit to a ... thing in exchange for some time being taken off their sense of what he volunteered for this program and took doses developed the on a daily basis\nOver a long period of time then then would be studied by\nScientists and they do from the CIA why do you would call a year or so later that is headed detrimental effect on him that he had his arm the or that he had certain\nSide effects from those let the years\nThat lasted for a long time but the fact there was even a rumor or belief at a certain point that when he was captured and convicted and charged with all this crime\nThat he was going to use that as a defense that he had somehow been psychologically damaged by the United states government prove this let the testing program but he never get used to that he probably should have because the defense that he did use was rather weak\nAnd the law because they haven't been convicted and given two life sentences\nYeah it wasn't ever able to collect the uh fourteen million dollar lottery winnings\nNo he was not he did not get that yeah Whitey won the lottery while he was a ... the ... box of Boston His power was a range far and wide that's why when he runs won the lottery people thought well of course why do you have the power to\nSomehow ... oldest system so that he wins the lottery she was a corrupting influence in the city of Boston for a long period of time he had this relationship with the FBI he was an informant\nFor the local FBI and his brother was the most powerful politician in the state the head of the Massachusetts state Senate Senator senator William Bolger [noise]\nUm so the Bolger story the story of his rise to power in the years in power and that means yours on the run it's really an epic saga that spanned the course of a nearly half a century candidate ending in the way that it did the other day violently in the way they did it's almost kind of a\nViolent exclamation point\nOn a on a long ... life it almost feels like kind of a fitting ending to the old your story\nSuch a great story you needed to books TJ English author and journalist for your time on a busy morning\nMy pleasure thanks for having me\nYou gotta CJ English has written two books on Whitey Bolger Whitey Bolger where the bodies were buried Whitey Bolger in the world that made him and the other was a book called Patti whacked\nThe untold story of an Irish American gangster also I Would recommend if you are so inclined a sixty minutes did a story a package on Whitey Bolger [noise]\nUh I I guess they were talking to the FBI agents who who captured him and he was living with a woman\nIn Santa Monica in an apartment and they got him as he was getting into his car one morning and it's just a wonderful
