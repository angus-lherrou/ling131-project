T. R. S. Trish Turner joined just she's in Washington with ABC News can only ... Turner morning we went to bed last night and uh we woke up this morning and the FBI sent their report to the Senate while while we were sleeping\nOn trade and uh we we our as a ... well after midnight the report came up to the hell is now under lock and key and then at eight o'clock the briefing will start a first step or Republicans and then they'll rotate and blocks of time between Democrats and Republicans after that so everyone's done ...\n... is this top secret will this be released to the public will we ever find out what's in it\nYeah great question and so the the actual all summer rains that the agents notes that puts coming up\nThat itself is a it's called committee confidential classified but there was a really big privacy concerns in these types of documents\nAnd it happens all the time what's happening different this and that was obviously we all know about it there's a great drama around that the White House the senators are aware of that and so many of them are clamoring for some version of this record\nSome you know cleaned of privacy concerns that something for public consumption they're aware that you know that needs to happen I Would not be surprised that I haven't decided just what they're going to do\nUh what about I mean the you know in Washington leaks like assume if if they decide to keep it quiet I'm sure each side will leak out the parts that is beneficial to their side of the argument\nThat show true it said that the uh I think that's also another reason behind book you know we need to get something out the public\nBecause if not our members are going to come out and then they're going to characterize that thing you know the way that benefits them off because let's face it most people going into that\nHave already decided how they're going to vote on Kavanaugh and so what they're going to take away from that like you say is whatever that you know it's going to support your position and you're going to come out of character as a report in a way that you know ... ... either looks good or looks bad most of the time that's happened no surprise there but\nI think that's why you know some kind of executive summary some version has this report will be made public it's not a guarantee but I think that's another big reason why they asked\nHow extensive was the FBI investigation we heard that there was limited in scope do we know anything about\nYou know we never could get the actual direct and I'm from the White House\nUh and so what we're left with is the concerns of people we know who might have been witnesses especially like that one of the accuser is Deborah Ramirez for instance there are a number of her of the witnesses she handed over who were the subject of that big New Yorker article on this particular case\nUm you know they said I was never contacted by the FBI one guy who said it at the time he's one hundred percent certain that he was told right at the time and this incident with Deborah Ramirez allegedly Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself in her face\nAnd that he was told at the time to exactly what happened the waiver merits on set it and he is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh's name as he is and yet the White House at the FBI never interviewed him and stuff he was frustrated he actually sent it by his\nDate met through an FBI online portal because he didn't know what else to do so you are going to have people say\nThey support the investigation already saying this is not complete until they're bloody Ford and cabin on they weren't interviewed either by the FBI and uh and said there are lots of lots of problems with that for critics at the\nSusan Collins Lisa Murkowski Jeff Flake Joe mansion Heidi Heitkamp those incentives ever centers everyone's paying attention to uh have they have they said anything one way or the other what what's their lay latest statements on all this\nNot at all they're not saying anything at all they want to read this report their aides aren't talking to us either and you know they they they want to sit down and they want to ask questions they want to see that now I'm going to make that decision for themselves I Would say only flake has kind of\nSee that now I'm not make that decision for themselves I Would say only like it's kind of told that ... the late um bombshell I met that sticks out you know he's going to support this nomination hear it on that track earlier in the bank was look I think there just needs to be\nAn investigation because in our country being torn apart that we we should do that\nFor the integrity of the ...\nUh and then the voter scheduled for for tomorrow correct\nA particular tomorrow that to keep our vote as well as the weather conditions aren't that final mission is likely later in the day on

mean\nBecause if you looked at dollar per square foot it would say your your work way less than you are so you would take that house\nAnd the tree car garage add the better features add the better kitchen rather better neighborhood like all of that's part of location\nAnd then you would say okay if that house had all of the things I had been based on what we're allowed to plots up for how how how much more as a bedroom or how much more of the pool where you start adding that on to that other house and that's the comparative approach so it's now\nAssuming that if that house had all these things and light based on what soul for around here that are available for higher then this is my biggest concern is then at the end after they've like made them all equal then they go\nAnd the size

Peterson had this amazing reaction he was he was\nExcited he said I Love it I'm so happy and I'm like explain that means that he's going to help so many people\nBecause there's this soldier mentality that you know I didn't do enough this other guy that I served with this you know there's this big guy that that\nThat saved us all the time that that jumped on the that that you know how to kill rate I you know write it all these you have this water mentality and I was just a guy who went there and I saw some things and\nI Can't possibly have this than ... and Jason wrote about that\nA in a really personal way and and and what changed ah Peterson told me is that's really going to help because other soldiers to other people who served in the military who were dealing with the TST they'll see those words then they'll recognize themselves\nAnd and start to call a the VA helpline and and perhaps seats seek help for its ESP so from a pure you know get away from the politics for a moment\nOr just from a pure human perspective in a country in which about twenty two Veterans Day are killing themselves this was a really big deal this is going to save\nSome law yeah look up a cynical people I talked to yesterday said oh his career is done and I was like hold on a second I disagree\nThis makes them real it makes them honest it it shows that uh you know you can go and get help and and after Tom Schweich the fact that he would come out and say there's probably a you know what else is the most important thing first but I think this does nothing but help his career going forward\nI I I I tend to agree with you and and but my first reaction is if if\nHe's going to go get his help and we don't know if he's ever going to seek ... dinner you know more political career he may be a part of his help process may be you know what politics is the best place for me to be right now right and so and so whether or not he has a political career a secondary to\nAh if I'm dealing with the pie TST and getting treatment and and and whether or not he comes back but let's say Jason Kander says I Want to come back and and and serve I Want to run for office again or continue to run his national organization let America vote I Believe that\nHere's one of the interesting things about candor and and and I always try to be careful with this with politicians because\nUh you know I've been full before but Jason Kander is one of the more I'm seeing here real types of people that I've met in politics and I cover him very closely as a state rep when he was pushing\nA ethics legislation and\nYou saw that in the Senate race against Roy Blunt you know one of the interesting things about that Senate race besides the fact that it's so close in a state that that overwhelmingly voted for Trump you didn't see a whole lot of attack ad and there was you know there was there was stuff\nYou see a whole lot of attack that and there was you know there was there was some questioning whether or not he\nLived in Kansas for a period when he was in the suburbs of Kansas City instead of you know Missouri or whatever but there wasn't a whole lot of it to happen again Catherine and and a lot of that just because he's a pretty ... guy that's that's kind of the way he's built his his career and so that was part of what happened here that\nDidn't surprise me I think\nIn a veteran and dealing with a problem that that our nation's veterans are dealing with in dealing with it in an open way and helping people is going to\nTake ten chili not hurt him if he comes back politics and I made the comparison in my column that that that the army and a former Missouri senator who was briefly a vice presidential candidate on the lookout for a ticket\nAnd and that in Nineteen Seventy two he was knocked off because it was revealed that he had been treated for some for some depression and some mental issues as\nWell that was different because people didn't know about it right was discovered and then all of a sudden there was a big shocking headlines well everybody knows about Jason Kander street now and it's\nIt's you know a lot of things have changed in our nation and I I I tend to think\nThat it's not a death now as it relates to a political career if indeed that's what he wants to do a a later he's still a very young man and a a has been pretty successful\nWant it to be done in a professional manner they wanted it to be a circus and that's what they've given us\nThere's a lot of people saying that there are this\nA confirmation hearing is\nEnergizing the base there was a new poll numbers out from Jim uh McLaughlin who back in June had a Senator McCaskill leading you by four points now after these last round of poll numbers after watching what happened in Washington You're up by eight points are you seeing\nYour base energized about what's going on in Washington\nState and we're everywhere we go incredible energy when the president was in town and said I should say ten days ago we had twelve thousand people jammed in human arena something like twenty thousand people outside they couldn't get in\nAnd were saying that kind of enthusiasm everywhere but really anger or gr I mean let's be honest it's anger people are furious\nThat what they wanted and I was sixteen when they voted for conservative pro constitution judges on the bands what we're seeing now is Claire McCaskill and the liberals just saying you know in order to Robert I mean we're just going to ignore the result reelection electric don't matter we're going to turn to\nSend you a circus in a sham and a debacle in order to prevent the people's well from being done that is wrong and people are furious about it\nI Will ask you this question as I can hear the people screaming into the radio right now Merrick Garland didn't even get a hearing when Obama nominated\nHim to the bench\nSo any of that go ahead any criticism for that some of the Republican Party for not even giving him a hearing\nBennett election then a girl and that was the whole point and a lame duck of a presidential year with the presidential election looming let the people said what they want the people that say secretary wanted by twenty points they said that they wanted pro constitution says on the parents\nWill we know it was a huge reason why people voted for Donald Trump\nAnd now we have the Democrats saying you know let's just pretend like that election didn't happen Claire McCaskill saying I'm just going to ignore the fact that my state won a pro constitution judges I'm just going to say no and this of course isn't the first time she said no she voted no to justice Gorsuch\nI've been wrong six times on Supreme Court nominees every single time\nHe barely out of touch with the state treated knowing the will of the voters and we're going to send her on or\nWhether a ... a pre existing conditions room because it seemed like a not only is this race turning on the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation but also preexisting conditions\nThere all sorts of commercials you're clearly on the record saying\nThat the Affordable CARE Act AKA Obama cameras long it should be read on on you all have attached a lawsuit on the stage saying that a pre existing conditions are wrong but you will come out very much in favor of making sure insurance companies\nCannot discriminate against people who have pre existing conditions what is the best way Josh Hawley that\nInsurance companies and people can know that insurance\nCompanies will not be able to discriminate on preexisting conditions if you're working and you could do anything you want it to\nWhere you have to put her to the law you have to put it in a law that insurance companies are required to cover folks the previous incandescents people like my own son ... I've got a little boy we've got two boys and I'll\nPut my older boy has a a a a chronic disease a joint disease bone disease that we found out about earlier this year\nThat they are but that's a journey for many many many families in the states\nHave stories like that so I think you'd have to require reinsurance\nThe states have stories like that so I think you have to require the insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms as everybody else\nAnd uh it's as simple as that and then there are various ways that you can ensure that that coverage gets maintained and that the the price point\nGets maintained I propose a a one way is that what I call a federal insurance guarantee where the federal government our coverage costs about ten thousand dollar that makes sure that the people who have pre existing conditions pay the same premiums and the same doctor both on the same terms of everybody else\nBut here's the point we do not have to have Obamacare to do that and Claire McCaskill is holding hostage to people in this day and people with pre existing conditions\nTo the failed legacy ... Obama and we can't afford it I mean people cannot afford the bill that they're being forced to pay health care costs up a hundred and forty five percent in the states in this day because of Obamacare known agree families should be forced to pay that\nIf you are successful in this lawsuit is successful in pre existing conditions is thrown out between the day it's thrown out and the time you come up with the new plan\nThey're going to be people who are falling through the cracks\nBecause look I mean be a I have no doubt that a court would\nPhase in any ruling I mean there's not as if it's just going to be a snap at a finger suddenly everything that's gone cost clans that had been sold and are guaranteed for a certain amount of time insurance companies can't ... the way the law independently prohibits that under various hip of provisions that prohibit back quite apart from Obamacare but look\nWhat about like Congress leaves a lot of their responsibility\nI mean this isn't about the court this is about Congress Congress are going to have to fix this law\nThey haven't done it yet and that's what families are paying a hundred and forty five percent increases in more but nobody thinks we can go on like we are now and November very family can be forced to go on like we are now they just can't afford it I mean Obamacare than a state of collapse so Congress is going to have to act\nAnd they and they should have done it already ... McCaskill had been willing to do it to promise and cross the aisle and get bipartisan reform we wouldn't be where we are today but she wasn't willing to do that I Am and that's why I Will get this done\nI Want to go back to what you said you know something new I heard you say about what this plan where everybody would buy insurance and it would be no more than ten thousand dollars a year\nWell know there are various\nWays that a majority cover folks are resisting conditions one way that I proposed an editorial yesterday as a you require insurance companies to offer coverage to folks their preexisting conditions on the same terms of everybody else\nAnd then what happens is there's a federal insurance guarantee I called it ends up state for tribes and had some success with it which is bad for cost for the insurance companies that run more than say ten thousand dollars the federal government\nPays those and that allows companies to offer the plans on the same crisis with the same deductible for folks with preexisting conditions as everybody else so you're you're I don't have to buy it in a separate pool they don't get taken out of the market\nThat folks with preexisting conditions are treated the same as everybody else they get the same price as the same guarantees and regardless of how you do it and there are other proposals about how you make that happen you have to require a demo law and that's the bottom line but here's the other thing I Am again\nThis corporate welfare for the big insurance companies that is a ... year big pharma and big insurance through Obamacare they love it but it doesn't work for anybody except them and that's what I mean\nIt sounds to me though that it what what's your proposing is similar to the Affordable CARE Act except that missed subsidies on the Affordable CARE Act are sliding scale depending on how much money you make it sounds like you're saying everyone gets the same subsidy across the board\nYou know the Affordable CARE Act does does require everybody to buy stuff but they don't want I mean the core of the Affordable CARE Act is the individual mandate\nWhich says that we're going to go out and forced you to buy health you're saying we don't care if you want it or not we're not gonna give you a choice either by the way you just got to go out there and by what we deem is available the federal government works for the insurance companies to say here's what the plant contained you don't get any choice and that's why McGraw in Ninety six\nOut of a hundred and fourteen counties in Missouri Ninety six there's only one insurance often on the health care exchanges under Obamacare one\nProgram or don't have any choice and if your premiums go up a hundred and forty percent either got to love it you know just go ahead and suck it up and bias\nThat is not patient centered health care that is not healthcare that works for the people of the state and that's why people come up to me all over Missouri and they say we can't afford a premium we're going to have to get a second job than the spouse back to work\nBecause we can't afford a premium we have got to bring costs down for families and her family's not insurance companies back and control\nThat is Josh ... he's the attorney general of the great state of Missouri and how many thirty three days away from the election already\nThree thirty degree from today accounting I'm Down everyday origin\nBut a lot of work to do but I tell you what we're excited and uh it it this is our chance McGraw is our chance to make our voices heard they didn't hear if you've seen apparently but we're going to make them here this year\nJust only be safe on the road and we'll be down the road check you\nKnow twenty or make five fifty K.

a good hour it's great information and don't worry kids he's not selling the timeshare condo in Florida so I\nEnded up selling that at all in fact you know this morning we're talking about\nA to my daughter I drop her off at school every morning I drop her off about forty five minutes early so I really appreciate her getting there early for me so I get to the work on time and every morning and the car I ask her Philip tell me a joke you know it because she loves to tell jokes and she says that\nTell me the difference between a well dressed man on a bicycle and in a not so dressed guy\nOn a unit a cycle that what's the difference and ask immigrant what's the difference\nI don't know a tire\n[laughter]\nAnd I said you know what that is funny because I actually might be something all utilize on the air today because I think about it you know when you think about your advisor that you work with\nSome times the difference is not data noted that noticeable sometimes we've been working with these advisor for many years and then we find something and we talked to someone else and they talk to you about tax strategy is trying to help you keep your money away from taxes\nAnd then all of a sudden we get to this point we say you know one now I got a call my old guy that had been with for twenty five years and tell them that I'm going to make this change because now I'm going to work with a person that actually really does financial planning and then they say\nOh well I can do that for ya\nAnd so my question is why didn't they tell you about that the last twenty five years that they've been working for you because you've missed out on all these opportunities and so that's why I say a folk\nLet's don't miss out on these opportunities\nBecause sometimes you don't we don't see the difference like that joke that I just said you know that we don't see the difference until we can find someone else had shows or something completely different than what it is that we're doing\nAnd I think it's important because taxes are different in retirement it's one of the only times we can control or tax situation\nAnd I think that we pay too much tax were working in years so we can figure out a way to never pay tax again it just makes our money last longer\nI have a dear friend of mine who ah found out the last couple of weeks the grandma took a turn for the words and so they're going to put her in a senior living and the kids have no idea where the money how the money what the money what they got what they don't God where is it\nAnd each and every time each and every

thousand and five two thousand six maybe he said to me I met him nicest man you'll ever wanna meet said to me region in the country's headed for a heroin epidemic\nHe saw this early on and said we are not prepared when he was right and he's been on the frontlines of this epidemic since the beginning\nHe uses drugs like no checks on Vivitrol these are drugs just ... right it's not and it's not one size fits all at arco\nHe will work with anybody to work with whatever you need to kick the habit to get back up on your feet and get going in the right direction there is a long road ahead but ... is doing great wonderful work at a fraction of the cost of other rehab places so if you\nThat was really root of you to say that about me\nSo that was not nice here it's just like the un Charlie granite D you owe me an apology [laughter]\nThat that was really an uncalled for and we're trying to\nShow\nFor well first of all what did I say that was inappropriate factually incorrect but what I mean what what would what would make you say that\n\n\nIt's true no you're right but but but that's exactly my point writes right to work got schooled But Eric Greitens one big\nSo because he felt well okay yeah\nI don't care what they are trying to get [noise] like the whole\nBook D. and I look and knock yourself out God love ya right I I respect you and your opinion and everything else but you have to admit that\nThe Democrats have done a terrible job selling their message to the American people\nRight you think that they they passed the Affordable CARE Act and then never talked about it ever again\nBecause they pass away [laughter] not really sure\nWhy not why not tell people that\nI\nSaw all wait a minute hold on a second now you're starting to sound like Charlie running right All right\nThat's all I said was the Democrats have been a terrible job selling their story getting out the vote 'em they passed the Affordable CARE Act and if it's so good defend it\nSounds good because [noise]\nMy point is this the is that the Democrats\nDidn't show up to the polls in two years ago\nThey just didn't and you would think that not having Merrick Garland even given the hearing would've so upset the Democrats that they will come out in droves to make sure Hillary got the next pick\nAnd they didn't come out so get over yourself where were they\nHave ice [laughter]\nOh you're over yourself the euro de\nUrine double secret probation saying that means thing to me\nThat\nI think you owe me an apology and being a right to\nDo we're trying to find common ground here and you come out and you throw that much of the meanest thing and it was ever said to me\n[noise] [laughter] my colleague that\nIt's not not only hit you set it not only is the meanest thing in the EU to say but you sound like two or three times now [laughter] so mean de\n\nDo you think's the phone call that was All right well ...\nYou're ugly and your mother wears combat boots could you say anything meaner to me\n[noise] um it's true though\nThe Democrats\nAre supposedly passed this great health care bill and then never discussed it ever again never sold it never got out and\nTold people right if it's so good and it's so wonderful why not run on it not one Democrat ran on it\nSo\nWhat do you expect die and you're in the big five fifty gate you're asking morning\nI get mining terrible terrible and south right after she got a college thank you die and that was very sweet of you [noise]\nI actually agree with you on one point\nThat crap really not a good shot [noise] and the reason I have added reconciling with it on in Congress [noise] without any how they can to turn Medicare into voucher system\nAnyone who could protect cannot do that with clay and yet and I'm Talking about\nThe Congress shut down the down that were drawn out and they can turn it off after all we pay for their insurance [noise] so um [noise] I agree again I think you'd be talking about that and they're not just thank you very much for your show\nDiana Europe sweet woman you can call back anytime it if the Democrats were smart they would have nominated Bernie Sanders because that's who the party wanted\nBut the party elite the party establishment wanted Hillary or thought it was Hillary's time right there was ... the party establishment in the Republicans wanted everybody but Donald Trump\nBut the people voted Donald Trump and so they they took their medicine and you know took the slings and arrows along with the good in the bat right\nSo she was not the most favorite she wasn't the most favorite eight years ago when when Obama beat her\nRight so if the Democrats were smarts they want to nominate her but they did\nSo they went down in defeat and now they're paying the consequences so don't get mad at me because you don't have any power to knock this guy off the seat don't get mad at me because Merrick Garland was was ... was treated poorly you didn't have the power you didn't have the juice and you know the votes so don't get mad at me I didn't do it\nAnd I'm forty six year big five fifty ...
