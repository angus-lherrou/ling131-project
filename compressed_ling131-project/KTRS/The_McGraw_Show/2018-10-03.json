a national emergency how we're all communicating through our cell phone\nAnd that's what it is to rapidly notify us if there is a\nMajor event that somebody his shot in Misurata if there's a nominee headed for us they want to know that I got\nA ... or amber alerts involved with this is well\nNow it's kind of thing but it's not even if you opt out of the amber alerts and the weather messages that sometimes go off in the middle of the night and scare the heck out of them it's different than that even if he opted out of that you're still going to get that you get would get it if you're found it on if you shut your phone completely off\nYou know he won't be subject to my eye on even if it's on silent or whatever he will be getting this alert you know this afternoon and had a couple of people

Arabic five fifty ... one Eighteen\nCentral time ...\nYour phone's gonna dang yeah it's a national wireless one Eighteen\nTest who would sue over that I don't understand that I don't understand that either I think it's actually a good idea at All right back to\nBack this rocky things so that the court rules that San ...\nUm and the NFL um [noise] uh\nThey're suing because this is this is where it gets really interesting so go back to when Cleveland\nLeft Cleveland to become the\nBaltimore Ravens they originally were going to be the Baltimore Browns and Cleveland sued and said you don't have any relocation guidelines we couldn't follow anything we didn't know what to do we didn't know how to do it therefore you're in violation and I'm sued one\nAnd ultimately settled\nThat the ... the Cleveland would keep the browns name keep the browns records mhm and they would treat the Baltimore team lack of quote unquote expansion team even though that was the former browns and then the expansion\nTeam would become the browns and accept all of the same records so if you are running back you're trying to beat Jimmy Brown's record in Cleveland even though Jimmy brown really played for the Baltimore Ravens\nBut that was part of the settlement of lawsuits a Cleveland got to keep their football team they just created a new one\nOkay so so the NFL then left then wrote relocation guidelines\nAnd then when was that that was in the mid nineties I guess ... and so um the NFL wrote the NFL guidelines and when the rams were getting ready to leave St Louis everyone was like well the relocation guidelines clearly said this\nAnd so St Louis played by the relocation guidelines which said good faith effort if you build a stadium if you have a plan for us for a stadium or we're not going to leave you which is the big push\nFor St Louis to get the stadium deal done\nSo that they could save the rams we have a plan in place for a new stadium you can't leave so they were just placate in St Louis until there was time for them to leave and then they left now the visitors and convention bureau is suing saying you didn't follow your own\nNFL relocation guidelines and the courts have now said\nYou everyone has the right standing on this lawsuit can proceed which means now they're going to go into a discovery Mm\nKnow how much does the NFL really want St Louis and I believe this is the ... down a doubt Bennett Bob Lutz yeah people are so ... how much do you really want to go up against a doubt NFL lawyers you don't so guess what\nThe N. F. L. your head doubt Bennett baby but they you know take on dad vent it man NFL is not going to back down to ... bank they well while they did with the Cleveland Cleveland\nOf the company made its first profit last year since two thousand and and I didn't even know you can do this they have gone bankrupt seven times [laughter]\nWow uh not shocking their stock didn't do very well in there I feel you yesterday\nYou you would say no they are planning to watch the model every year\nYou would say\nNo they are planning to watch the model every year from two thousand sixteen to two thousand and twenty two because they have to do the other twenty two so we'll see how that goes for\n... yeah ... we'll see how that goes for my right uh what are we doing with um markets today Scott gross\nToday the futures look up sixty right now we hear from the Institute for supply management uh also uh we get the pie short for the report so those numbers for about\n... medical terms of a good day things which are going to censor things were\nAlready six forty five fifty year as a bombshell announcement from Jason Kander yesterday who ran as a Democrat against Roy Blunt he was going to run for the mayor of Kansas City but uh unexpectedly pulled out will tell you why\nIt's a national story will do that coming up here in nine minutes six forty one big five fifty ...\nCalling from the Manhattan here to let you know that I did that all of them are made in half mailing we have a ... year round and retain the seasonal flavors\nLike beach carrying rhubarb an apple decadent banning Sunday and laughing and who could forget our Chantilly lace night that was ... cream on top of that I came in with fried puff pastry class the as soon as they can in Manhattan\nFor ... and you're only these day party cover for the men\nThey can stay on the year after twenty five percent off right you're right that I'm jewelry and watch as much as I said it on our wall of arguing that make them rather than a shot plaza joy has been leading shoppers for over one hundred years you need to worry about repairs and friendly car back that small personal ... when\nKillers I think my attention\nAt St Louis soccer fan catch all the actually have the final to St Louis as the regular season games October tenth cancer gene on those Budweiser beer garden club ticket for ticket to more information at St Louis says the dot com [noise]\nSt Louis the traffic center here is Tim Whalen sponsored by less it Tim\nAll right and the brother still working with the ... north down highway two Seventy just before grab boy the left lane is blocked solid back to highway fifty five now those right wings on fifty five north bound are backing up from ... bottom\nUp ramping on a highway two Seventy if you're a on west down to Seventy in orange county we're seeing the slowdown is already starting between three sixty seven and west or\nEast bound and highway forty is slowing from highway Seventy through about lake St Louis boulevard and still heavy on the on the popular Street Bridge\nFrom tutor onto the bridge this traffic report sponsored by staples staples helps keep your business moving with a huge selection of ink and toner always in stock and always pride slow and during staples pretty good that this month the prices are even lower staples I'm Tim Whalen from the St Louis closet company traffic center\nIt's definitely a warm and muggy morning out there and this afternoon it's going to be hot\nNinety three degrees also windy partly cloudy skies increasing class for your opening hours warm breezy and muggy with rain and storms moving through I had a cold front Thursday much cooler behind that front hides in the mid seventies took a lot of clout could fill out a few showers and storms out there\nBut you see me Chivers said that they might be the case here at\nAll right it is I'm Seventy three degrees a balmy\nSeventy three to gross humid and it's so humid out there so power to\nLet's exports once again he was doing All right thanks so Gaga boarding everyone in sports sponsored by St Louis F.

pages so the New York times editor eight pages because uh this is such a big expos in such a with all the charts and graphs and everything else haircut just keep following this story ABC News course on a corresponding from New York in mourning Aaron\nMorning to you show a pretty extensive story by the New York times the premise of it is that Donald Trump is not a self made billionaire\nWell that's that's certainly one parent is the um the the the times researched his family finances and business practices uh for for the last year and a half and and delve deep into his father's real estate empire the president's own financial dealings\nAnd came up with a picture that is at odds with the president's origin story of taking a loan from his father what he gets caught a small loan of a million dollars\nAnd using the art of the deal to to build his real estate fortune uh what what the story\nSays is that in fact the president took four hundred million from his father and had a a reliable safety net as he engaged in a series of what the paper called dubious schemes and outright fraud to evade taxes and build his fortune\nAh there's some there's one thing if your dad decides to get your four hundred and Thirteen million dollars it's another thing if he breaks the law it is it is it explained what is unseemly what a dad did for sun and what is breaking the law\nI I I think you know any trust in the state's lawyer would tell you that wealthy individuals often try to find creative ways to dodge taxes and and to preserve as much of their\nMoney as they can uh and and here you have just the specter of the president of the United states doing those kinds of things which may have been fine\nIt is it into the United states doing those kinds of things\nWhich may have been fine or at least you know\nUnder the radar when he was just a real estate developer but but maybe cast at a different light now and and I think there are a couple of ways to look at it and in in one way it's the wealth transfer from father to son in ways that were at least unseemly may have been dishonest and ... and the times reporting\nThere were instances of actual fraud now there's no criminal liability here at the allegations are just too old\nHowever there is the possibility of civil penalties and the state tax department here in New York has already said that they are looking into the allegations\nAre what President Trump and the White House has said this is one hundred percent sauce but how did the New York times uh they must have gotten some tax documents they must have gotten some paper trail did they know and it's not on the\nFront page and he had no checks and receipts in court documents and and things with the president's signature and it's all it's all published in the paper and and for the for the president's attorney uh he says it's a hundred percent not true but but they do not breakdown point by point and offer a detailed\nResponse said this is a story that was research for a year and a half\nAnd and the uh the times investigation was probably too detailed and well researched for for them to to just ignore\n'em by the the response so far from the White House is that it's just not true and they uh Sarah Sanders the White House spokeswoman turned her ... toward the pressure constantly trying to report on the president at a negative light about the investigation I think in addition to poking holes in the president's\nYou know origin story I guess if we could call it that I'm also details some of the the the unseemly schemes that were used it in some cases you know a ordering cleaning supplies\nFor some of his buildings and then selling them to the tenants of those buildings at a twenty percent markup as one way of of hiding some of hiding some money is it illegal maybe not but it's a weird maybe\nA New York times also criticized itself for its own expos a of Donald J you you're ...\nAnd and it it it said that you know the president has has so often it even before he was running for office has so often repeated the story of how he got his start\nThe the million dollar loan from his father and then you know self made from there\nAnd and everybody kind of bought it but I think it's long been suspicion at least here in New York because the the Donald Trump's exploits had been so long um you know covered by the tabloids usually because Trump was leaking to them uh people at a sense that that\nIs this wasn't necessarily as a a successful as he portrayed it and and that there's always been a suspicion\nAbout you know whether he was completely on the up and up I mean not to cast aspersions on New York city real estate developers but I I think it it it can't come as a as a surprise\nThat there may have been some some shady doings uh but when that person becomes president and and there's an investigative light that others don't get 'em you know it raises more questions and the president has the story drop was on stage in Pennsylvania talking about tax reform\nYeah no I think your point is well taken is one thing you want to use the star of a reality show how many people care but when you become president of the United states\nOr the magnifying glass gets much a bigger the times says it's basic story on more than one hundred thousand pages of financial documents including tax returns from the father and some of his company's air concerts you thanks for ... some some light on it or have a good day\nYou typically not uh uh we should say that New York times uh is on line obviously um but it's also in the paper the front page of the papers to take a look at it um they have\nCopies um canceled Jackson receipts and and and I mean it's really a very unique front page story and uh they had to add apes extra pages and to the prince addiction edition of the New York times\nAlso in this story critical of the New York times buying into the narrative so the New York times writes a story that it is critical of the New York times\nFor um\nA bio on him back in the nineties\nWhich we don't want to read the whole thing they also have a quick little summary of the takeaways from and you don't want to read the whole

slew care southern cooking you want to talk about today\nWell this is uh something that I uh I think\nPeople really want to know about what's the right guy yeah or what's the wrong guy which they eat what shouldn't eat and uh there's there's a story that came out which sort of implicated the southern diet as being\nReally bad for your heart health and it turns out that's probably true ah but I think that there there's a couple of different ways you could look at it you know the people than coke in that way and the self traditionally for\nPretty woman can do when I hear is it's it's not new a show what really is it about some things in the southern diet that are particularly problematic number one is salt\nAh and especially in African Americans with high blood pressure or these folks are highly so sensitive and you eat too much salt so what's what's a high self meal and collard greens a sort of bays insult was they they simmer there for hours and hours and hours or\n... that those are loaded with salt and when you eat too much salt you hold on to too much\nFluid and that raises your blood pressure and can promote a continued high blood pressure which going is going to increase your risk for having a stroke and heart attack down the road a\n... had a lot of fat whether it's bacon fat whether it's fried food and saturated fat the southern cooking has a lot of fat associated with it so there have to be considerations for a modification\nSo he can get a good fried chicken dinner or take the skin off and eat the breasts are so eat the white meat inside with the skin off you\nDecrease the amount of fat and they take a walk in with that meal um maybe try to get some low Salter no soul code greens to go with that and don't add the butter and the sour cream and everything near mashed potatoes don't at the salt to mashed potatoes I'm there's nothing wrong with boiled corn Anglo current pretty good\nUh the only thing that I thought I thought that was probably the butter\nThe butter and the corn and read it the cornbread probably is fine in self the butter on when you add it to is probably the thing that I Would try to avoid and so\nI mean nothing in my book is absolutely no an absolute yes as far as eating I think you have to think about things in terms of\nWell what is my risk for heart disease and high but do I have high blood pressure do I have diabetes or or which my risk for stroke and and act accordingly and you nobody can be bulletproof and where the Superman Cape and be able to eat anything they want\nA but I think we\nBelieve that in our younger years we can eat anything we write and then all of a sudden at some point in time we think in the back of our heads some point in time I'm going to eat healthier ah but ah as all of us know now I'm an avid as we get older it's really hard to change what we\nDo so I I have found that uh you you build up a tolerance for salt spray the more salt you like the more salt in need and so I don't eat a lot of salt and I if I Do read something something like wow that's awful solve\nThat tolerance or or craving or a sort of a necessity a ... ... ... people wouldn't put salt in their food if he didn't taste good and there wasn't some kind of crave like hey I liked that flavor\nOr we wouldn't be dealing with people like that can there be too much where everybody's got a little bit different concept on what's enough salt or too much salt ah ah I don't fault my food either but ah it has nothing to do with trying to be low salt that I'm more like you I write I don't care as much for actual\nIn low salt that I'm more like you I don't care as much for your actual flavor or not people who do really like solving really like seasons foods but and say wow you know\nDid you tell me it makes my blood pressure go up and I need to stay away from the salt it we need to work on the the uh no salt seasonings or you know switch over to the peppers yeah a lot of great peppers and some kind peppers and some other things\nYou can make your food tastes really good if you care for those flavors use those flavors and stay away from the\nSo I you know what you are correct pepper and
