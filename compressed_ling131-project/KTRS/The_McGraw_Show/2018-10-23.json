plane crash on the ground John Brunner just dropped it that way yeah that would have been done I mean how much money to these people have they're just so filthy rich and\nThey know their their kids you know their heirs have to be like\nOh that's that's what I'm saying yeah how much money must you have that it's\nThat it's enough to where it doesn't matter it's enough to where you you're literally burning it right and you don't and people in around you don't care because we have\nEnough you can do take that a hundred and sixty eight million right he's not like and you know what I'm going to miss a car payment to see if I get to become governor now that's not right right up putting this on his credit card this is just cash 'em up\nI I I Know it's the mind real event that kinda money why would you why why are you buying aggravation\n[laughter] I mean how do you think they make your ego must be don't you think that Trump's wake up occasionally and just think wide and\nThere was a um he did interview a couple of months ago with somebody with some of the pack something and somebody asked them what would you tell the Donald Trump before you know the two year or the two years ago Donald Trump did he say like don't do it and he said I'm don't become president don't don't don't run for for president and it was just a minor little like\nThe show Seinfeld but never would have been successful\nShe was always I always felt like she was a dime and she was\n... of the show that really made it\nChemistry the right formula you know without her\nSuccessful you have to remember just her and I in the room she came to me\nLarry was there and we were just talking\nAnd we had two pages of\nA a scene and I said let's just read this together\nYeah I mean literally\nIs exactly season\nAnd Julia Louis Dreyfus met Larry David in one season she was on Saturday Night live and the one season he was writing it was a failed right Irfan I like yeah\nShe she is really delightful she's really delightful and speaking of money I you know that she is the daughter of the crisis fund\nUm which is I mean this is a fortune that originated I Believe an Eighteen century France [laughter] so you're talking about but she is she's just start as she she she goes in and she fits in everywhere and every\nVery talented you know you're absolutely right yeah and she has sixty million dollars in in uh in her dryer when she cleans their pants\nYeah exactly yeah yeah that's from the grocery store right right right oh yeah oh I see now I Know I put its ... ah All right\nDo we have another one or is Aaron with us\nIs Aaron ... you know there and we do have our ... ladies and gentleman who has drawn the short straw and asked to cover the one hundred and fourteen the world series good morning ...\n... ah this one is happening in the city of Boston which is recently earlier we winning things\nBut to say in in in in the time\nOf my growing up there was you know it [noise] they should have heartache but nonetheless um will take the recent success and and they're looking to win the world series for the first time in five years Dodgers looking to do it for the first time in Thirty years\nLast time of course was Kirk Gibson walk off the debt that worked out that worked out okay\nYeah I Can't believe what I just saw a so I get out of your um news a hat for a second Aaron ... ... ... as a as a fan of Boston sports does it ever get boring when your teams keep wanting\nSo much winning yeah it has like a Trump campaign slogan and I have to say in in ... we humility and and and and modesty\nKnow however it's weird because you know when the broken with the patriots quarterback growing up and you know\nYou know when Steve broken with the patriots quarterback growing up and you know ... was in his waning waning\nDays and and you know like green well was playing field for the red Sox it was not a good luck to you know we have the Celtics in in the eighties which was you know protection fell but uh but to have baseball success\nWas you know almost a herd of you know there was the book episode which is we don't speak a\nWhile and then the Boston won their first world series right here in St Louis at Busch Stadium and even then there was the ... you know they were sort of like a sense of America's Team rooting for Boston 'cause they were such as so heartbroken over the years but now you guys have become sort of they hated rude fans because well we were inseparable\nNow yeah I mean with the with the winning and yeah\nAnd the and the and the attitude and it it is weird because there's been a generation of of of Bostonians that knows only that you know in in ESPN a great comparison about the tremendous success over the last\nDecade plus for for all four teams and then um\nYou know and and and for the red Sox to be where they are as it is just it's just awesome I mean the money talks of course that I think the uh but this team is is I think fun because it you know keep it became [noise] probably the MVP right but he ...\nIt it's not a roster of of of stars unnecessarily it's just they wear you down they play real baseball and and get guys on base and we don't have runners off the plate and it's it's kind of fun to watch\nYeah I ... when the when the red Sox beat the cardinals and the great stories of you know somebody going out to their dads grave and putting a baseball game that I mean that was great now it's like get this you know get the world series over the weekend you know used\nTo it I thought it was new to read and write vote again next year I Know I Know it is a weird it's weird\nYeah I ... the one more thing I Want to I Want to ask you about and that is a this is the coolest that baseball has changed so much and now the ... bowl pins are running games and everything else but the last time the Dodgers\nAnd the red Sox played in the world series was Nineteen sixteen a hundred and two years ago\nThat's right and uh the Dodgers are still in Brooklyn they weren't even called the Dodgers yet they recalled the robin's after the guy who was managing them at the time and the red\nSox um started a pitcher named Babe Ruth who it turned out had a fairly decent career in another city\nYeah yeah it is part of his what twenty nine scoreless innings in the world series insane\nThey said uh and and the the um [noise] actually that World Series\nEven the Fenway Park was opera bowl I'm you know what is it is the nation's oldest the ballpark and uh but but the games in Nineteen sixty and we're actually played for the Boston Braves play their games because it was just bigger and\nAnd they needed more for the fans and I but I think it all this one you know the old town park all do decide\nTo go there and a good luck and thanks for taking a camera\nChamber seven and twenty five year big five fifty gauge as always wondered what it'd be like to have it like a Yankee fan or a\nI guess the cardinals kind of know that a little bit right did you ever get tired of winning\nA I think I think there's always that danger when you start to take it for granted because eventually the clouds are going to roll in and you're going to have some lawyers where things aren't as you know wonderful as they had been ... ... yeah we do we had taken it for granted\nYeah I just to you know the the teams win like them like the the um the macho macho Canadians won five Stanley Cups in a while and you get tired of winning firemen or would you be like oh this is another maybe I ...\nYou know and then you have the blues fans solving a long suffering blue oh my goodness there we're there to Chicago Cubs the ice rink one years ago on strong out now\nAnd uh you know I I'd like to see the blues fans for a while for the for the St Louis but for the blues fans I mean that is just and plus hockey is just so gut wrenching to begin with\nWhen I was a kid and I mean we're talking a very very long time ago when I was like eight or nine\nI Would baby sit for a couple every Saturday Night because they went to the police can't or any this is how ... they would get dressed up and I mean really dressed up to go to the ... games and now I I mean I don't think people get dressed up anymore but it was it was like the big red things to get dressed up that's why\nI like the ... the ... have made the playoffs in three years it's like we're trying to write tribute to San Diego Padres fan exactly and great I mean I Know oh my goodness three years or what are we going to do\n[laughter] humanity three whole year's city

Trump's former attorney said and I quote Bob Mueller is an American hero in my view\nSo Donald Trump's former lawyer okay former lawyer in the White House working with Donald Trump against Robert Mueller yesterday said\nBob ... is an American hero in my view okay but\nHe's no longer there that is correct okay that's like coal and all of these people who leave Trump it is a it is a rarity for

I I don't know\nUh and and that you know you've got three court cases right now all of which probably will end up to the appeals court\nUm this is going to be going on for a\nWhile what's the kids so confusing about this is the land is already cleared the federal government already said we want to build it here I don't understand what the arguments on his over the land now\nWell here's here's ... to me here's how convoluted it is and I and I don't know if Jay Kirk has been search this and determine if that ever happened anywhere in the country for but the city of St Louis basically just shot eminent domain against itself\n[laughter] wow basically what happened in order to protect yourself against the claim that a banker has in a court\nIn Franklin County in which that banker is accusing the city and here's the thing where I get really interested\nThe reason that that banker is accusing the city of fraud is related to the soccer stadium\nBecause if you're a member\nThey did to the soccer stadium\nBecause if you remember when the previous iteration of the soccer stadium came in at the same property where they're talking about building potentially building a new soccer stadium right now\nThat property is in the key north side regeneration print and so if it's going to be developed in that footprint under current law that some of that tax revenue is going to go into the north side to benefit the north side of\nThe previous soccer developers said whoa whoa wait a minute we need that money\nAnd so this city went to the king and bank of Washington and said we want to redo our agreement we want you guys to agree to give us some things in exchange for making sure that we get the soccer stadium\nAnd the key and the bank said okay\nOr redo our agreement one more time or give you some revenue you give us some consideration man that soccer deal didn't go through\nAnd the the basically said yeah remember that agreement we came up with yeah we're not going to pay attention to that anymore now there's a new soccer stadium coming into the same property but what is the sitting done before that proposal\nTook place the city basically set DePaul McKee urine default so you no longer have development rights so we don't have to negotiate with you what I Wonder what I suspect and I don't know this but what I suspect\nIs that the attempt to get the key and a bank of Washington out of the way has much to do with the soccer stadium as it does in Ga Ga is common ... days here\nThere are ten different ways the city could've could've taken care of making sure that energy a guy that plant free and clear they could have bonded if they could have done what we do when we buy houses\nAnd uh we go to the title company and the title company goes all the searches to make sure there's no we can sometimes you have to you know beyond a little bit of money put some money in the title insurance to make sure that it protects the new owner in case some old lean comes up\nIs there are a million things that the city could have done short of eminent domain itself\nSally why I Believe that the the attempt to get a key and a a bank of Washington the apple camped out of the way has as much to do with the new soccer stadium as it does it against\nUs only go back to what you said about uh they're they're they're moving eminent domain on themselves the land is already cleared years saying the ... the argument now is who has the right to Mickey or the city if if if the kids who writes they've already agreed to eminent domain but if they own it they still have rights the image domain so that's where they can\nCall him a domain on land they already own\nWhite but but the city is planning a semantic gang what the city is saying is all of these various city entities that the L.

A. that that helps the IRA age the the the the the various\nBodies that do economic development on behalf of this thing what the city is arguing is those aren't the actual city entities we created them they're they're they're fully funded and paid for by by city tax dollars and everything else but what the thing is saying as\nHealthy already does the land not us so we're taking it from them more eminent domain he's out um but but they're all in the game together I mean it's the city eminent domain and get felt\nThat ultimately what's happened and uh so far circuit judge justice that's fine ah no problem when I'm five you know we'll see what happens when those cases go to the appeals court or the echo camps they they're going to appeal\nUh they they run around in Franklin County the sitting try to stop the Franklin County sheriff and the appeals court said no you go forward\nA and so you know got all these court cases in in in the end I think ultimately the appeals court or the or the Missouri Supreme Court is going to make a decision and I don't think it's going to get in the way of in Ga I think that was always\nA a strong man put out there by the city to help run of a it's public relations effort against McCain\nGa is coming and Ga is going to get done uh this is just a matter of whether or not of the city ends up paying the bank of of Washington for violating its previous agreements that the bank of Washington says get hat with the city\nRight so this isn't the little old lady who has a house sitting on home plate then that will sell for the betterment of the stadium\nBut this is an argument over the land is already planned and developed the argument is who owns it so who so that if it if it turns out that she still has the rights somebody's got to pay me the key is is that right near the city owns it\nThen then then somebody has to pay the city for the rights\nIt's it's really the bank of Washington because they have all the liens McCain doesn't have enough money in the property right now it's back to Washington so\nYou what you really have is you'd have an argument between wealthy powerful people over who gets to profit now that the MTA has come to town rent gives it is it a key and bank of Washington who took the risk and more than anybody else brought initiate a town\nOr is it wherever the city choosing as as the next developer\nTo come in lies and take over development rights that's what this is about and and and I don't know who that next developer is yet but that's that's what this is about\nTony is is this is this common I mean when you talk about economic development in major metropolitan areas is is this kind of thing in common like never I've\nNever heard of it and again and I'm not an expert in in a you know what happens in other cities other than you know what I've written about previously it was a journalist but I've never heard of a of a city eminent domain itself\nAnd and this is the city going to war with the bank that by the way is is developing and lending other projects in the city exactly the people\nBut then there's like a two sister hotels that wants to someone signed and one sits on the other side but they're all connected like you just walk\n... you don't even know you're in a different hotel you know one is the roads would properly which I'm sure our listeners that you have ever stayed in a row where it's a very very very upscale really um\nFox five star or not that the grand high it is and I mean this this child child I mean it's large of the high it is there's a lot of room or the roads or whether it's small more intimate but then on the other side is another hotel\nWhich I I had never heard of before called the S.

to go it's there's no if somebody wants to build a McDonald's in St Louis they're going to build in St Louis for the reunion or not\nBecause they've done the research and they say it's a good thing to do I just don't understand why anybody would want to go right to work\nHere's my argument with gerrymandering and I I understand what you're saying though I think it's a little bit of an oversimplification you can't blame Democrats for the demise of the city of St Louis and our inner cities there was a lot of other factors then go into it not just those terrible Democrats but let's start gerrymandering for a second\nThere are people in ... do\nWho are in lacy clay district that no matter what no matter what they do\nThey are Republicans or conservatives and yet lacy clay represent them because they are in the district and their gerrymandered into his predominantly democratic\nDistrict and their their their voiceless because they've been gerrymandered into lacy clay district right so they really have no voice in Washington DC or and and have no chance\nOf ever getting a representative because they're in lazy clays district all those commercials out there right any of them critical of lacy clay know why he doesn't have a chance of losing um so the people who are stuck in lacy clay district I'm not picking on them I'm just saying right\n... gerrymander the state races okay and you have to make 'em fifty fifty or whatever else I'm it's impossible to get a sixty forty state fifty fifty\nSo you are going to have people who are in a district that are one way or the other that no matter what happens they can't ... their vote doesn't count in a sense I'm so no matter how you criticize gerrymandering\nNo matter how you draw the there'll be gerrymandered\nFurther explained to me you know does that make sense\nTo do I don't know that they've ever seen lasik lay out in their area and I think people are getting on just a just fine\nWell that that was a point though right but I mean there are people I'm sure there are Democrats in in very highly Republican district that that\nWrite that no no matter how many times they votes um you know their district will remain opposite because it's gerrymandered\nYou know that's just the way the game was played um so you know it's all up these fights I've been going on since they invented this system in the Seventeen eighties so\nSteve thanks a phone call appreciate your comments [noise] um but I Do find is that Steve is one of the few truly conservative giant minds in the state\nAnd yet he is against right to work I just find that kind of interesting to ... year um did farmer Dave sell you another piano is that while you're hosting the yard sale no he did not sell me another piano he is on assignment and he asked me to do it and I told them\nI Would teach him how to host a yard sale on Saturday um where does he get clean Missouri will gerrymander to favor Democrats\nAre right now it's a sixty forty states sixty sixty forty ... those are rough numbers let's say fifty five forty five there are more this is a Republican state there are more Republicans than there are Democrats\nAnd so if it's impossible to gerrymander the state so each district is fifty fifty um and but not only\nThe state so each district is fifty fifty\nUm and ... not only that but you're gonna have to gerrymandered districts so that somebody living in ... Missouri might actually be in the same district as somebody in the city of St Louis\nSo because we're against gerrymandering but but to get a fifty fifty district you're gonna have to gerrymandered knob Nasir into St Louis city that doesn't make any sense\nSo that's why I'm somewhat confused by this clean Missouri it's a good marketing name clean Missouri who's against who wants to dirty Missouri I Want to clean Missouri I'm voting yes for this\nUm [noise] let's see here um\nThe clean mo opponents are using the fears of others by claiming black wraps will take over white districts and vice versa okay Ann Wagner doesn't listen to her voters unless they have a lot of money to donate or district is so gerrymandered she doesn't have to listen to the people that's just not true\nUm [noise] uh let's see here\nUh\nIt's a pot roast kind of day where can I find your recipe\nMhm a lot of people want my pot roast recipe my pot roast pot roast passive recipe\nWill be posted November first and not a day early you know why it's like the pumpkin beer if you have pumpkin beer all year long it's not special so I'll post my world now world famous pot roast recipe\nNovember first on the Web on the big five fifty ... how 'bout that\nAmerica to your credit union am ego CU dot O.
