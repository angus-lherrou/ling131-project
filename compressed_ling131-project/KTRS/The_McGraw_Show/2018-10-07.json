actually been able to graduate from clients to no longer require our services these are folks who you know they may have having knee replacement or they may have had a hip replacement and all those things that are all your friend you're talking about [noise]\nUm and they no longer need our services but the one thing that comes through every time from our clients is that we help them to do what they need to do to stay as independent as possible and especially with those\nThey need to do to stay as independent as possible\nAnd especially with those clients that we've been working with ... in the hospital who needed to have some help at home to be\nAllowed to be discharged and yes there are times when doctors or social workers or even the insurance company says you know we're not quite ready to let somebody go I'm In less they have some assistance at home\nI don't know if you realize this yard but Medicare has some guidelines in place that basically says to a hospital or to a rehab community or something like that\nThat if they have patients were discharged\nAnd that for some reason some preventable reason they end up going back to the hospital or the rehab community within thirty days that's a big red acts against that hospital or that rehab wherever they were discharged from\nSo often times we will talk with people and we'll go talk with her social worker and we'll talk about some of the things that we do\nOne of the big things that we always try to stress is we want to make sure your now one of those frequent flyers because the last thing you want to have to have happen is to have to call nine one one in the middle of the night\nAnd have to go back to the hospital it's hard enough getting in one time but when you've been discharged and you have to go back and it's just not fun at all so perfect example of that was this week I went and visited with somebody in the hospital\nAnd she was talking about having fallen\nAnd the hospital was saying um she's going to have to go home\nAnd I asked about well what about this and what about that you know it's just things that we've seen things that we do that we know about and again I'm not a doctor and and I don't pretend to be one but just simple common sense ideas and thoughts\nAnd I went and talked to the social worker and I said I don't think she's really ready to go home isn't there a way we can get her into rehab so that and ding ding ding here's where the bell went off for this social worker so that she doesn't have to come back with a ... admission\nExactly so now is it time for all of the

everyone else is definitely committed to seniors and everyone's just as nice as the next person\nI was a senior this [laughter] here I Would not know who to pick I wouldn't want someone\nHere I Would

Nineteen was truly craft it for what I Need it for\nYou and your team do\nYes absolutely we definitely do we spend a lot of time with our seniors\nAnd those that are on Medicare could be someone that's been on disability for two years and now they're going on Medicare or they might have been on disability for several years and they just want to know how their plan is to accept to the other plans and it's about asking specific questions like\nYou know how much dental any effects share based on last year are you happy with your doctor said she's been going to argue shopping for a new doctor the other questions with the\nHave you had a loss in hearing and has anyone in your family said hey if I Want to look at things in the hearing that really determine your plan is best for that person because depending upon where they're geographically located they could have a a network set with the best\nFor them to access to all of the services\nAnd and it's not just the damage claims that you represent either as a\nWhole I Do the whole other side of traditional Medicare and the traditional Medicare in our area there's approximately twenty six different companies and the interesting thing about this and this came up yesterday San with one of my clients [laughter]\nShe came in and she said diets I've really heard a lot about Medicare Advantage plans but my sister has a Medicare supplement plan should how does that work and said well it works when you have an a\nAnd then you have your be happier that covers your hospital and then you have your be yeah that was kind of our hospitals but mainly doctors and what they do for you and those two things you sign up for through Social Security now I'm going to back up a minute\nAutomatically if you've worked the forty quarter so for ten years then that would cost to it\nSo then be the one that has a car so matter what side of Medicare you're on and then you get the D plan after that if you stay on the traditional side do\nYou drink un sees her drive\nSmartest thing the government ever did for us [laughter]\nConfusing is\nThat is that's so then after you have the then you get a Medicare supplement that that's if you're on the traditional side but if you stay on that traditional side so I'm like I said there's about twenty six different companies and those companies they're all\nThey're all manage all given the same plan from the government\nAnd it's exactly the same plan no matter who you buy it from their kids all price differently so let me back up and explain that\nTo let's say you have planned or you have plans she every single company is a is a Medicare supplement company\nIs the same exact plan that the government providing planned gee that plan up but they all have different prices so it's like car shopping\nIt's like going to the lot when you see your Cadillac you're like all that kind of like ... the few thousand dollars\nYou know down the street and you find out well that Cadillac just exactly the same same solar exactly the same I quit and then and it's fifty eight thousand dollars for one of the world is that well it's because of advertising is because of the different ways that people are paid within the company and so there's all different pricing set it's exactly the same\nSo there was somebody can get\nThe same because the government says you're going to provide this particular plan with this particular insurance with these particular deductibles or not and it's just how they build their company and how they price their products around what they don't\nExactly and so it's a matter of looking at what is the\nWhat's their am best ratings are they an a plus company or their history how many times that they had the rate increases is that something that's going to predict the future and is that something for justice for that particular person to consider\nIs that important to them in with those plans really doesn't matter who your doctor is because if your doctor except medicating her almost claims that Dr Enright\nAbsolutely\nSo bad side we referred to that side of the traditional side with the Medicare supplement and having heart to see if we ... we refer to that side as a crease\nPaid plan your premiums are created pain for your service so often times the premium amount the trip Payne\nMight equal on the other side of Medicare which is the advantage plans it might equal what someone with max out\nBandage plans with is\nStill has to sorry we need to ramp up a little bit when I Want to find out what's the best way of people are confused because if you were talking about earlier you have some calls this week and a lot of them came from thank you very much for supporting\nThe folks who come in and talk with them how yeah somebody they need much needs to get in touch with you in touch with you what's the best telephone number for them to reach\nThe best way to reach me as to call my personal cell phone and you will be given a number that is my number for my office as well as my team\nAs well as my scheduler and my assistance or you can tax me some nice this week Sean I Will say it's your fault that up until about oil I Am in the

getting a\nInflammation and our brain with these um [noise] I don't get too technical here but there's a certain cells called micro uglier and if they get activated it causes brain inflammation and okay so people with Alzheimer's and dementia there's this intense widespread activation of these micro ... cells\nAnd inflammation by itself is just to oftentimes protect a attributed to our lifestyle but can be treated and oftentimes reverse if we address what's driving it so one of the first things we check foreign functional medicine is digestion and leaky got which I'm sure a lot of people have heard about\nOften coincides with leaky brain and that's where these particles make their way through the blood brain barrier\nAnd cause inflammation in the brain so a faulty immune system to be at play 'em as is excessive oxidation which we just talked about earlier\nAnd um overall I just wanted to in addition to glue to sign on which was that really important enzyme I wanted to shed some light on to nutrients in particular that can help the aging process okay there are a seat all L carnitine public acid\nSo these two nutrients again the Seattle L carnitine in ... and a bit slow down and in some case reverse the aging process of the brain\nAnd they'd been some studies out with a a ... it's an amino acid number or it can boost nerve a nerve growth factor which helps the whole brain cells repair and I'm also repairs synopsis\nAnd it's been shown to help her a repair damaged genes in the mitochondria and can reverse even some cases of diabetic neuropathy\nYou know a lot of what you're talking about just ... I mean I won't say what\nVirtually everything you're talking about is extremely technical which is why you're here because you're the professional at that bottom line what you're saying is that through internal healing processes through the kind of stuff that you do\nYou can help people in terms of reducing some of the inflammation and hopefully starting to heal some of the things that are going on within their body absolutely and so if people want to get in touch with you\nAnd what's the best way for them to do that [noise] ah\nWell I'm going to lead some resources on the Web sites where it's a little more digestible at your own pace\nSo to speak sure and honestly he what he didn't know that he was making a joke they're folks that it's a joke you know so that we can digest misinformation out digestion go on\nAnd you can always visit our website but um which is a doctor to gear dot com okay so that's\nD.

Can't hear oh send for the next hour we're talking money whose money your money why because you work hard to make your money you want to make sure you invest it wisely and we had a busy program today we're going to be talking about charitable giving we're going to be\nTalking about health insurance we're going to be talking about the investment markets we're going to be answering your investment questions all of that in one hour or so let's get started you know money talks is for the purpose of helping you feel more comfortable with your money and last week we talked about\nThings that I thought were very very important and we're going to spend\nMore time on this or let's say from the eight thirty our until eight forty five but last week we talked about how important was to start getting prepared for buying and purchasing gifts\nFor the holidays saving for your IRAs uh and then these are things that are extremely extremely important on the other hand one of the things that we didn't discuss which we're going to discuss today\nHis charitable getting because you know once December thirty first comes we can't do any more charitable giving for two thousand Eighteen now some people give to charities because they really want to help the charities\nSome people give to charities ... like the tax deduction they need to talk to their CPA to see what type of tax deduction they can get and still others do it to help the charity and to get the tax deduction\nSo this time of the year that we really think it's important to start helping those organizations that need help and today with us we have a gentleman flight Klein who is chairman\nOf the Mt Zion Baptist church in St Charles and you know if you look around folks and you see what's happening to many of the religious building in the St Louis area and I'm sure it's probably not just in the St Louis area\nBut all over the United states churches\nAre folding\nWhy because it's getting more and more expensive\nYou can find out from the CPAs that may be charitable giving doesn't give you as much as a tax write off as it used to but again we get back to are you trying to help the charity or you're trying to get the tax deduction\nSo one of the things that I wanted to bring up and looking around it's how important it is to help\nEnjoy\nCharitable giving so they can enjoy what they are doing so today we have with us Mr Floyd Clyde flight welcome to money talk\nMore and Bob and thank you for having me you\nKnow a ... one of the things that I'm I'm\nWe wanted to share today a is some information about them outside and Baptist church in St Charles and why that might fit into charitable giving could you could you give us a an idea what's going on\nBut yeah but I think you are first and foremost we were dedicated to carry on God's work but the Bible to do a guy we surveyed the food distribution chores for families and they\nAre the congregation is smaller though as we provide food for me is thirty families on a given day and we also ... clothing for those in need and oh for sure loose or are they voting for even for the city of St Charles so\nSo the church is not only for what churches are far it to help the entire community exactly\nAnd and those are things that are extremely important not only to the church now to relate to the members but all to the community that you serve and one of the things that I mentioned earlier is\nMany of the churches regardless of what religion it is a are having problems\nAre financially or tell us about where your church is right now\nWe're in in recent years were you know we have suffered some uh fourteen bucks of both financially and membership was however we we are committed to continuing to work and below so\nIn order to keep the church going um you know\nIn order to keep the church going um you know things break down ah we we lose an air conditioner I mean it it doesn't sound like a big thing\nBut in order to keep the members you've got to keep the church going and in order to keep the church going and keep the members it's a it's a back and forth situation\nUh what what what is what is going on that you really need\nSome big help on to keep the church active and vibrant and working properly\nYes my my church is relatively nicer facilities or if it's only about Twenty years old a ... HGH systems you know there's been near a narrow life expectancy\nA carpet is beginning to show where a huge issue in where should say and we need to do some updates in a parking lot as far as a repair and stuff\nAnd frankly speaking for the uh the card congregation we were a have a fairly hefty mortgage I'm you know do you know I said earlier due to work with the lord of the primary focus\nOr we need to then we'd have to maintain our infrastructure elect elect to above the church history dates back to Eighteen sixty nine year old a need for you know the continued existence in in his community\nThat is so long I bet you I bet the church could write a book [laughter] yes very very good so a flight the church has a big event coming up or to try to raise some funds can you tell us about it Oh thank\nHave a new Supreme Court judge and I don't know about you but it seemed like for the last um I'm going to say we can have it's just been very very nasty out there but we have a new Supreme Court judge\nNow Ireland telling some folks the other day I don't know if this is going to continue or not but when I was a kid\nIf somebody came to a playground and wanted to play ball and they had a bat and the ball\nAnd they wanted to be the pitcher and everybody voted that they wouldn't be the pitcher that kid might say well in that case I'm taking my bat and ball and going home it seems like we have got some\nPriorities are really screwed up\nA on both sides\nI don't know what that's going to do\nBut I can tell you that it looked to me like the market sold off Thursday and friday which ... which he did anticipating that maybe uh the gentleman was not going to be the Supreme Court judge and so we'll see what's going to happen tomorrow\nAnd the market rallies so\nWe'll see what's going on which brings me up to the election\nOn November the sick you know I mentioned earlier in the year back in January that I thought the market could have pulled back and I also mentioned that I thought many of our delta clients that maybe some of you out there nine delta clients but money talkers\nHad had enough profit\nOr in your portfolio so you might want to protect it so you might want to move some more money to buy\nAnd many of us did and the market and sell off sold off from about twenty six thousand six hundred down into the twenty three thousand level and now here we are back up\nAnd down at twenty six thousand for forty seven in the meantime all a little over a week ago we made a new all time high above twenty six thousand seven hundred and the NASDAQ has made a new high since\nJanuary and he hasn't paid five hundred has made a new high since January and they've sold off a little bit now so my my opinion is is that there may be a pull back around election time\nThere could be pulled back at any time\nBut for this time unless you really just feel uncomfortable it's my opinion\nBecause I don't tell you what to do it's my opinion that we might have pulled back but I don't think it's going to be a lasting one I don't think it's going to be the end of the world I don't think it's going to be big but I think it might be a pull back and if it has a pulled back it might be a buying opportunity\nSo as we get closer and closer to the election I'm going to share with you my views on what I'm doing\nA with my money and I better not say my my money right I better say harmony chance money my money but right now I feel comfortable in saying we're going to basically stay where we are right now\nNow I feel comfortable in saying we're going to basically stay where we are right now do we have some ... do we have some stock she has to have some equity she has to we have some mutual funds yes we do to a avenue to usually have fixed index annuities variable annuities\nDo we have alternative investments do we have precious metals do we have all of our life insurance is\nDo we have home owners do we have car insurance yes we do so it's our opinion my opinion that we have a pretty good diversified portfolio and the markets may take a hit and I may be one hundred percent wrong but right now right now\nI think we're going to see ah the market tried to make new highs between now and\nThe election in November sex\nAnd for all of our money talkers we have some big meetings coming up\nI'm a November ... than fact we have a lunch in a it's a voters day in fact it's a very very fun going good meeting called eight thousand days\nNow what does a thousand days I mean you come to the meeting at the royal Arlene's have lunch with us and you'll find out and that's the only thing we are going to be talking about is a thousand days\nAnd then we had a big meeting on the fourteenth the November and the fourteen to November has nothing to do with the investment market and it is open to the public and it's going to be an generations generations what the heck is that generations\nThis lady Michele travels all over the United states giving this talk\nAnd it is of who it is hysterical it is just really enjoyable now at least it was for me because I took her class and I said you've got to give it to our money talkers\nAnd so she said she was so that's on November the fourteenth and it's going to be at the YMCA in West county uh Chesterfield parkway which is about two minutes may be that much from our offices Chesterfield Mall\nAnd that will be from one o'clock to three o'clock\nOn November the fourteen uh and so these are the things that ... we want you to know about also this Tuesday\nWe have a meeting on our World War Seventy five year reunion um\nAnniversary which will take place next year and we're going to be going to France\nAnd we're going to be going to the beaches and we're going to go or we're going to have dinner and

their fiftieth wedding anniversary they as letters from the governor\nOr I think they're getting a letter from the president and a congratulating them they're just really really great people well one of the things I Want to share with you today that I think is so very very important as we talked last week about the things that we can do going into\nUm the into the year one of the things I said was

investment standpoint wouldn't want to make sure there's if you qualify\nA for an hour eight you participate in an hour it\nWhat do you do a traditional or Ross are re\nI feel it's important to put away as much money as possible and in many different ways says you can't now you can discuss with your CPA which are a traditional are Ross they feel is best for you but remember you can typically contribute\nTo your traditional are Ross irate all the way up to April Fifteen of next year that's two thousand Nineteen\nExpensive for folks that are under sixty five\nBecause the insurance companies

your health care or to a private insurance company and they handle all of your health care and health care needs through your doctors\nAnd special ed so\nIt's really important for folks to sit down

who will call them Shirley and John\nSurely in John it's out there and get it right there\n[noise] so surely in John ... a are retired and they had a house this was about five or seven years ago or something like that they had a house they sold their house I here in Missouri and here in Missouri John who says Shirley and John\nReligion cases John John is is a little bit he's\nGot MS okay any struggling and they sold the house to try to get smaller corners first you know to live life out in the ... and ... years now and we got them they reverse mortgage now with the reverse mortgages is if you are over the age of sixty two\nYou can get a loan on your house okay and you never have to make a payment the rest of your life as long as somebody lives in the house okay that's ... year why is that you don't have to be sixty to do for a really ... mortgage yes\nHuh okay listen yeah holidays\nCan I just I just my my fiance is parents have one and I just they're not over sixty two so I was just\nOne person has to be\nOkay and they don't have a reverse mortgage that's my to fertilize it in a federally\nInsured you know I just sort of you know this more than I did All right\nSo here's ... well before we get into how it works is let me tell you what we did so they sold their house they bought a condo for two hundred and forty thousand dollars to\nThere were ... when they sold their house they make two hundred thousand we ended up getting them alone for a hundred and twenty okay\nThey put down a hundred and twenty they kept the other two hundred thousand or eighty thousand dollars in cash okay\nHe gets a pension every month like five grand okay and he's doing just fine and they were living there what time is passing into to level conduct two story kind of ... and his MS has deteriorated yeah okay\nNice to people you want meat yeah very cautious nervous because over their lives\nAnd they haven't they've been taken advantage of many many times which many older folks patterns and so you know when everything happened they were nervous but passed in the first transaction I hear from them all the time [noise]\n[noise] time passes and her situation starts to deteriorate tremendously now the kids\nWho don't live with her love that house yeah OK keep that in mind when they grow up [noise] a couple of weeks before she sees things started ... if she takes the hundred and twenty thousand dollar house\nAnd she gives it to the kids wow [noise]\nThen she passes away [noise] [noise]\nNow when she passes away on a ... yeah okay the errors have up to six months typically to refinance alone or they can just walk away from the house and let the government\nTake ... yeah well they take it as it is it's not so close to ... but [noise] when they do that as\nTheir obligated to sell the house and Ninety five percent of the value of the time of the passing so they got the hundred and twenty thousand she passes away and they re by the house at Ninety five percent of the values\nWhich is fifty was forty seven thousand dollars and they kept the extra cash so I had gone out out of hand me a protector of equity you work hard all your life can be a protector of equity in your home yeah so it protects it\nNow they're they're disadvantages to the heck of a they're not cheap can't do a big along with the heck I'm yeah [laughter] okay and they are not cheap and there are closing costs related to the transactions that\nChange anything if the if all house goes up like crazy or is it all of a sudden now is all decided that that doesn't matter that they ...\nYou know if it goes all the way up you're going to want to refinance Jorge oh yeah that's how I just didn't know if when they ... when they do sell the house where they take the house if there's a deficiency which obviously in this lady's case there is ... ...\nThey can't go after the rest of the assets of the state okay so they can the guy if he has a million dollars a bank they can't touch it and I guess can touch us\nSuch protective various disadvantages our number one in a cruise interests you end up owing more money overtime number two\nIs the interest is not tax deductible to the day that it gets paid off okay so if you're living all these years and you do all money on a heck of interest is growing up you know get to take the tax burden the tax reduction if you're going to take an itemized tax deduction got it okay\nSo you can't do it the day you pass\nAnd the long gets paid off in some way or another the estate then can take that as a tax deduction but you're not while you're alive while you're going to happen in our case of John and surely when they sell the house and they pay off that had come from the interest will become acceptable Oakland then we'll give them a new one\nSo if you have parents who are in ... and they pass away and and they're still as air just just curious I don't know if you know all the information like would they have to come to you if you're the the mortgage person they went through and they just kind of talk to you about what the right things to do on yeah I mean as as\nYour as the person that has the experience and the knowledge I can guide them what's the better route to go if I think the house is worth more than what they are ... you know it's a government insurance program there you're not violating any ethics and has brought this is not like getting a regular Morgan's saying hey\nYou know I all more than what the house of work on my walk away and this is in the actual guidelines of the heck are okay so you're obviously paying a little more than you'd never make a mortgage payment as long as you have a balance that's the advantage of\nA ... that that is the big big deal and it's designed to give people a senior citizen has the ability to have a better quality of life I you know you guys should area had turned against and yet it's not income based either you do have to pay your on taxes and insurance can\nOr can't you do have to have to have some sort of income yeah you know even if it's a hundred dollars a month or five hundred dollars a month\nSo I we had another customer that got the heck I'm [laughter] and they were considering selling their house to live in West county they couldn't afford it they both retired I unfortunately his retirement was very heavily invested with Bernie made off\nSo what are we are put in his lifetime he lost a good ... sadly you lost a big chunk of it\nAnd so they couldn't afford to stay in the house and keep the payments on the Social Security and\nSo they went to leave and downsize and when we went over the ... and stuff than it was great it some you know if you have children you need to talk it over with them because you have to feel comfortable there to realize that\nYou know move their inheritance is going to be diminished by the fact that this happened but it's going to give you a better quality of life so [noise]\nHeck I'm as a great product\nPlease don't just jump into a search the research call me again three on for three to four four four four zero I go through some more of the ins and outs there are some complicated and things that we're not going to talk about on the show because there really boring and my wife but still like talking about how come she thinks it's morbid\nThrough on for three to four forty four forty or
