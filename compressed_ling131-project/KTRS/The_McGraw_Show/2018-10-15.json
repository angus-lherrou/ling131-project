I agree with you um are two and a half hours\n[noise] oh I think so it seems destined for the Supreme Court and and it and it's by the plaintiffs in that case a group of Asian American students that no one seems to be able to locate it's really being driven by an anti affirmative action activist who's been you know kind of in this realm before\nBut he says that the schools Harvard is unfairly discriminating against the Asian Americans in favor of other minority groups by imposing\nEffectively in a legal quota and he says now with Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court the Supreme Court may take a different view of this case\nAll right so the ... the argument is that Asian Americans it's harder for them to get into Harvard or they have a different set of standards or what they are yeah the\nThe the argument is that they have been the artificially limited in their in their numbers that effectively there is a quota on Asian Americans so that other minority groups can be\nA better represented a and and they say it amounts to in a legal quota and it's not an appropriate use of of of race as a factor and in fact they succeeded in polling some\nRecords that they said at the plaintiffs say show Harvard is discriminating against Asians and and counting the number of Asian American students admits even though others out there may well be qualified\nHarvard has a private institution can't they discriminate any way they want\nThey take government money though and and that's where this case may end up turning out of Harvard not going to turn away uh the the millions of dollars in government grants that that it takes an open them up to this kind of a lawsuit\nWhich um the is as as you say has a lot of people watching I think because it does seem like it will be a test case the last time the Supreme Court took up the race in admissions was back in twenty sixteen Justice Kennedy\nSided with the the the more liberal justices to say that race can be won among many factor is considered in admissions\nAnd that's been how it is here now the the the big concern among the the defendant says that this may go a different way\nYou know uh you're you're ... you're saying they can't find the Asian students who are suing\n[laughter] well it it it's they haven't been public about it they and and it's not clear exactly who they are they haven't been named they're supposedly a group of it does in Asian American students that have been represented by\nAbout a a guy called ... who is under the umbrella of of students for fair admissions\nAnd he has been a a kind of a GED fly in this realm he's out of Virginia and he is a suit before any is organized\nBrian this rallies out of Virginia and he is a shoot before and he has organized lawsuits before because he believes that affirmative action is uh has run amok and that there is no place to consider race\nIn a in in college admissions and there's been some success you'll remember the University of Michigan had its policies struck down at the University of Texas\nHad its policy of considering race as one among many factors upheld\nAre we going to learn how Harvard admit or admit students and I said look\nThere been books written about how Harvard admit students but it it is something of a trade secret documents that that this lawsuit succeeded and being on earth during discovery\nI think may may shine a light on how Harvard attempts to balance its clashes forty thousand students apply to Harvard each year and they're only taking a fraction of that number\nMhm Erica turkey ABC News corps probably not a good day aren't that younger ... seven twenty three year big five fifty K. tier as how about this story that's getting absolutely no attention but probably should do you remember Aaron Hernandez he was the tide and for the New England patriots went to Florida\nWho um ultimately a ... was up on murder charges guilty went to jail hung himself while in jail when they did a study of his brain they found out that he was suffering from C.

put it this was this was reason number six hundred and Seventeen why I don't like Halloween\nYou had somebody there would be right there you could take her friend\nYeah but you can have a friend you could tell you couldn't stay when the park was closed so they can only be there during park hours that Laurie it'd be a good friends with ed McGraw viewer I were to do this with a look at all you can you come with me and talk to me while I was in a coffin for a couple of hours or\nWhat a weird promotion will not enough money to get me to do a\nYou know and again can we say this thirty hours\nIs a walk in the park yeah it should have been for the month of October oh my God\nI write I mean let's let's right do it for thirty days yeah and then pop off right thirty hours really\nThat's not very long I'll get off the organs ... documentary fix our ...\nAnd every every hour you know driving you don't drive when you're driving a car across the country you don't get out and walk around\nOr is that he's not he's not packing you're holding you down with a big contract for choir who's going to be you know falling apart soon and he's he's not yet he turned twenty six this week\nHe barely older than ... who's seen as you know part of the future of this to all those young guys that came up this year you know the age of ... and Patrick Wisdom they're all older than Bryce Harper he's just been in the leagues since he's been Nineteen\nSo you you if you had a guy like that then he becomes the star of your you know emerging youth and they all go and they all kind of age together I think probably Harper is just now entering the prime of his career that's what his age tells us at least\nAll right so what happens so let's say let's say it's a ten year deal that means he's thirty six civil back what three years let's say a best case scenario is wasted money that's that's a hundred million dollars over four hundred million dollar contract that's going to be wasted seven years from now\nWell that's that's one way to look at it another way to look at it that you're paying\nMore for the prime years than factoring that end of the costs but you'd probably lose on the back in when you give a contract like this\n... you know whether it's ... position player anything you're probably banking in fact he might lose up to a year to you know some sort of an injury that happens in baseball you're also factoring in you know the benefit of what you might be able to when he might be able to have that players peace\nI mean when the angels gave our pools that money they weren't thinking about OK what seemed to be doing now they were thinking if we win World Series you know the first four seasons here spin that contract becomes justified now they didn't do it you know because you know they they weren't able to capitalize on the crime right how everybody talks about the decline\nBut if you if you if you win a series of world\nSeries with our schools are probably not sit around and talk about how fat of a deal\nThat was the thing is you know you when you give it a long contract like that you're baking on you have to bake in all of these risks to bake in the injury which you bake in the fact that a guy probably not going to be playing as well at thirty six disease at twenty six right right but you but you factor that in because you need\nSome sort of presence that says that this team doesn't have the team can develop pictures that could turn you into a starting pitcher\nYou know they they're they're not they're not miracle word out what they have right now is kind of a\nThe next guy who's going to be the face of this team but more importantly the fear factor on the line if they hope to his marshmallows dude I wasn't I don't know that it's safe to bank on him being right next year with the shoulder I'm\nOn the other thing is he can be gone after next year he's gonna be a free agent after next season um unless the cardinals sign up to some sort of extensive so really when they miss out on Stanton owes unit was kind of like a patch\nAnd and now they're going to face the same question again is who's the next year hitter and this and this lineup they've got some really good players coming at third base so I don't think they necessarily want to give you know a ten year contract to anybody at third base I think Harper makes a lot of sense you've got to figure out what you're going to do is extra Fowler in the right field situation\nOr let me ask you this this question I was watching the playoffs over the weekend Bryce Harper nowhere to be found as a matter of fact the nationals really haven't done anything on this playoff World Series stage so they can finish\nWithout him in the playoffs with them what's what's gonna what's ... what's the proof that he's going to bring him to the to the promised land\nFlask and one guy to beat the face of that a face some of the team at the guy that puts you into the world series is top I'm and I'm not saying that's what the carnival do here I mean that's the kind of player they lack I Do think there are better organization than the national the nationals fired\nA dusty Baker and hired this bit its current manager Dave Martinez who ... who looks awful on the job a\nLot of times in his first season Bryce Harper did make that move\nHere the nationals have done a series of of things that I just haven't seemed to write a for a while now Bryce Harper is going to be deemed as the guy you can't get it done in the playoffs until until he got ... that's how\nThat's how that works but I also will point out that the national someone more games and the cardinals since Bryce Harper entered the league it's rookie\nThere that they won the second most amount of games and baseball behind the Dodgers in front of the cardinals the narrative that Bryce Harper is a loser Bryce Harper can't win it doesn't it doesn't really stand up now you can argue that he hasn't gotten as deep as he should have been the playoffs you know that's that's fair there are a lot of good players who haven't won a World Series\nI Am a you know not to say that you've changed my mind on this than me but I Am I I Will admit that I Am wanting to spend money like somehow I'm In the inheritance game right\nThis isn't my money and I'm not getting it if he doesn't spend and so what do I can spend the three hundred million dollars to pull in a million dollars I'm not I'm not going to see it one way or the other\nThe cardinals have done a good job I don't know if it's something in the water or what but they've done a very good job of making fans concerned about the payroll\nUm you know this team it's I think it's important to point out when you're talking about these discussions first of all yes it's easy for us to sit around and talk about who they should spin you know more would point out that when you're not cutting the checks it's very it's very easy to dream big it there's a few things worth mentioning though this team makes\nMoney hand over fist fitness is good for the cardinals the TV contract is outstanding a ballpark villages his bump and they're going to be having the condo soon I mean the money's coming in so there is a case that says you know it's time to it's time to increase the\nThe spend a little bit to show some urgency after missing the postseason three years in a row there's also a sense that\nYou know because of the urgency fans would like to see them go out and create some energy to create some some some pal factor and nobody does that like Bryce Harper I mean this was a guy who\nHad wondered why baseball is not a bigger deal um he wants to be a superstar he wants to you know be is as famous as LeBron James and and you know he wonders why baseball is it more of a a name brand sport in this country\nWell he'd never you know he's he's St Louis has made for a guy like that I think you know St Louis revolves around baseball whether the snow was coming down or whether it's the middle of summer uh I think he would I think for that reason it would be really really interesting\nYeah you're exactly right where were these scooter sit right now I Would say as a Twain walking and have a right chair and so you know over the course of about ten minutes\nI think you would be maybe two dollars and fifty cents on the scooter which is cheaper than a new over a and depending on public transit may actually be about fame and you don't have to take a few\nSort of like hobby I have to leave it at a fix location you can actually leave it outside of a business or outside your home or wherever and someone will come by in the evening and pick it up and ... you don't have to worry about it anymore so yeah it it it really takes I think a certain level of humility [laughter] to\nTo look at transit system and and really say you know we don't necessarily know what the future holds here but you know as a steward of taxpayer money you know I'm going to be flow to start dumping money into\nA this transit project or the transit project because you know technology is such today that we're probably going to be seeing a lot of innovation is like the the
