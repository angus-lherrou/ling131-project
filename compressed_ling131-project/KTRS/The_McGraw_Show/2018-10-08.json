of the more fun stories in the last couple of years there was a street artist named Banksy Sherrie ... who are shall we say struck again over the last couple of days\nShares restaurant graffiti him for canceling guy and graffiti and this was one of his original art work probably is burnt orange sauce famous um the girl with the balloon chick reaching out for a balloon that tend to shape the heart and soul they thicken it between like two and three hundred thousand dollars that it went for almost a million and a half box [laughter]\nI'm at in the middle of a room full of very rich people by the second day was sold in the hammer went down and\nPatently it started self destructing and went through a shredder that he had built into the brain of the photograph and it went stopped halfway which a lot of people say the fact that it stopped halfway made it even more ingenious because now I'm Still have a bank the but it's cut in half and you have a story to go along with it\nI was yeah I Would say that the whole painting and the whole thing is now worth significantly more\n[noise] yeah exactly I mean you know and he actually put a video out on his Instagram page explaining how he did it is everywhere and I ... and he wanted this to happen and then\nHe could be on the ... even built the shredder itself it kind of cool it's got little and ... knives in there and what made\nIt actually you know go down and and and Fred and what else is interesting is that a lot of speculation because nobody really one hundred percent sure who Banksy is there's been speculation for years on how we might be what artist you might be there's\nTalk that he might be the British musician others say he they think it is a guy who's been an artist for a long time\nBut they say they think that he was in the room when it happened and nobody knew he was there\nTill he may have been the one that set off the remote control to make it ... and then there he was taking a video of it itself went in ... and people say they saw this guy he was wearing like a pair of glasses video tape on that when it happened kind of knowing what's going to happen in the Fort what happened and they quickly left\nAround this guy has ... is is the master of deception but some somebody's somebody's got to be in the room to hit a button for for the for the for the shredder to start working right\nYeah exactly I mean he's got a lot of people who are friends of his I mean he's you know people who try to to shielded identity and who will say who it is or who who it is and I mean they try to keep it secret\nSo it's kind of cool when you have actually something that's still a secret in this day of social media when nothing sacred any more [noise]\nUm it's kind of cool to try and figure out and speculate who they think it is I think it might be the\nArtist by the name of Robin gunning ham\nBecause he was seen several places they think they spotted him but how do people think it was his British musician [noise]\nUm that map and attack here front man for that and his name is Robert Downey ...\nHe was seen and and the banking artwork started showing up at different locations where his band math attack would play people were saying okay now for speculate\nThey performed hair at banks he showed up here so I think it's ham however the first guy that's Robin getting ham criminologist Queen Mary university they used to crowd sourcing techniques to try to identify where he was where he was a time of the techniques [noise]\nI mean it's been a guessing game in Britain for a really long time but they think that's the way it is that\nI Do we know who bought the painting\nI Know that was a secret it was one of those that was one of those rich people to buy it online and have a have a person do it over the phone for them yeah maybe he bought it\nFor maybe ... well I mean how 'bout that so that the paintings self destruct after being sold one boy or a million dollars what a great story Sherry thanks for checking in thicker I got there is a two movies you should see about Banksy\nOh one is a documentary called exit through the gift shop\nWhich is\nReally\nMind blowing\nThrough the gift shop it's a story about Banksy kind of\nUm but you you you learn a lot about Banksy in this in this documentary called and just to see the gift shop and then there's another documentary and I think it's called ... thirty ... thirty days of the month of Banksy or banks she takes New York it's one of the ...\nBanksy the month of Banksy or banks he takes New York it's one of those and what he did was for thirty days in a row\nNew Yorkers would would wake up to another Banksy prank\n... each day they would be like well we'll look at the end he would draw something he would create something he it was really each day New Yorkers would wake up for thirty days and then they would and then the other thing he he does he takes his paintings and he he sells them he gives it to a street Walker mhm [noise]\nAnd um so they sell them on the street for like five dollars you know these go for millions of dollars and people drive either like in the ... you know like yeah [laughter] so he sells his art teachers commissions people to sell his art for like five dollars\nOn the ... you know and they have a folding chair the guy there was an umbrella and he's sitting there and the guys like you know five dollars a picture and people walk by the end no\nLoser later and then yeah but he's ever known as the rates all\nDay will do know that you know it's worth millions of dollars but this guy is the ultimate prankster\nBanksy or exit through the gift shop is a really interesting bizarre\nAnd you can't it's just really very good it's a it's a movie with it a movie

S. dot com that St Mary's H. S. dot com\nI I think you can you can point to a lot of reasons migrant Jennifer but I think at the top of that list has to be the elimination of the filibuster that when\nHarry Reid exercise the nuclear option as the circuit court of appeals and district court judges and then McConnell and the Republicans exercise the nuclear option unlimited filibusters as the Supreme Court\nAh I think it was simply inevitable well then we have this man right but\nThis goes back the reason why Harry Reid took it off what was it because they weren't giving Obama's judges any ... any for a vote for any ... any ... any passes because they weren't getting Bush's judges any passes because they weren't giving a Clinton's judges any passes because they were giving Bush's judges any vast will they\n[noise] they were slow walking right they were getting confirmed but but they were being slow walk I think the other the other a\nMoment that we all need to take a step back\nIs I'm\nSort of back to eighth grade civics class\nAnd that is we live in a democracy\nWas majority rules\nA corresponding peace to that and that is there is a minority who lost who doesn't rule\nHow far are we willing to allow the minority to go when it doesn't get its way\nAnd\nI say quote we witness the last three weeks I'm is right on the edge of what we as a democracy ought\nTo accept so back to your question\nOf snowflakes and I thought about this over the weekend because I'm the outrage of ah the liberals and I don't mean that as a negative or over the I Can't believe they wouldn't let a woman's voice be heard\nIt's it's not they didn't confirmed Brett Kavanaugh because he's a man and they didn't believe Brett Kavanaugh over him because it's because he's conservative\nBrett Kavanaugh were female judge conservatives would've believed the female judge over the\nMale accuser\nWell I think we had a we had an object lesson in in why pronouncement of absolutes in anything whether it's medicine law or certainly politics the pronouncement of absolutes is not necessarily the way to go and here's a perfect example\nWhen Dr forwards allegations ... went public ... there was an immediate pronouncement of an absolute\nThe women must be believed senator her Rona the men should just shut up right well then\nSenator her own all the men should just shut up\nRight well then ms Ramirez allegations\nThe women must be believed and that was the absolute\nAnd then ms sweat next gang rape allegations came forward and suddenly even even the opponents\nOf justice Kavanaugh said oh my goodness wait a second well but at that point it was too late for them because they had already pronounce the absolute the women accusers must be believed and so I think\nWe as a society and and we as as the electing body for the government we need to think about\nHow do we\nHandle allegations of sexual harassment and sexual abuse and\nAnd there has to be a better way and all I'm saying is to pronounce absolutes that thou shalt believe ... shall not believe why is not a good way to go the other I guess\nUp there there aren't many bright moments\nBut what what we have seen and is totally lacking\nIn this in other context is grace\nOh well ... where where is there an element great grace\nGrace grace left this conversation along\nSo ago so off and you and I talked about it on the air a couple of weeks ago McGraw was young ten year old lives a cabin off\nWho said to her mother's as they began their evening prayers we should pray for that woman and I guess what really ...\nI'll I'll I'll take off my hopefully object to hat and put on my editorial hat\nThe angry as I got\nThrough this whole episode but growing Jennifer was Saturday afternoon vis a vis Saturday afternoon when they got ready to take the vote\nAnd Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer made their final speeches and if ever there was a moment for those two men to exercise some grace ... they haven't spoken dozens of times with vitriol and passion\nIf ever there was a moment for grace\nThat was it and what did we get\nMore of the same bit grill and then I'm On the one side and chess pounding that we won on the other and I I Can't tell you how angry that\nMade while Jeff Flake I think the best on sixty minutes you don't get any credit for being bipartisan you don't get rewarded for being bipartisan so is it their fault or is it our fault because they're just a mirror onto the electorate\nAnd speaking of counting how did we teach civics classes now\nWell it's it's a it whether it's ... Jennifer or or my my law students but I think\nPart of it is a and in in the category of civics lessons\nWe have now for Supreme Court justices\nWho were appointed by presidents\nWho did not receive a majority or plurality of the vote right\nWe have a justice who Saturday was confirmed\nBy senators\nWho represent Eighteen percent\nOf the population and as I remind my law students and and you and Jennifer could remind a grade school civics class\nWe like to say we are the great democracy\nOr tell that to Hillary Clinton and Al Gore [laughter] I'm as to as to how purely democratic we are I think uh the ancient Greeks uh would would perhaps see us a little differently my point being that\nAre there as you say McGraw there is no\n... and Senator Flake\nSaid there's no reason to go to the middle to to govern in a bipartisan fashion well part of that is because we we are all elected by the fringes we've done early the leaders are elected by the fringes so there's no incentive to govern from the middle\nWhat happens in the next couple of weeks if a judge Kavanaugh rules\nThat Wilbur Ross doesn't have to testify or tone him or anything of the White House doesn't have to turn over anything or that Donald Trump doesn't have to testify in a criminal case or uh what what happens when he votes with\nThe president on any one of these huge issues that might be coming down the pike\nOh I think I I Would sing it suggests a three three separate reactions a Rachel Maddow al and Lawrence O'Donnell will get up on their desks at MSNBC and clout or that he's a partisan hack and this is a perfect example\nSean Hannity or will get up on his desk and say see this is why we need justices who will apply the wall the law um and the three of us and and others will say\nHe did what he took an oath to do apply the law and the constitution as it is written as it has been interpreted and I guess as a practical peace to that McGraw\nChief justice John Roberts\nIs as protective of the institution of the United States Supreme court as any chief justice whoever sat in that chair\nWe can safely assume that went issues like that like the Wilbur Ross deposition or or the um all humans clause litigation with President Trump as if and when those get to the court\nBrett Kavanaugh will not be assigned\nTo write the opinion by chief justice Roberts ... that another justice will be assigned to write that opinion justice Kavanaugh may cast his vote\nWith the majority but I think we can rest assured that chief justice Roberts in protecting the institution of the Supreme Court he will have someone else rights that opinion\nAh leave you with this little history lesson which you know all too well and um people keep going back to Clarence Thomas as contentious as Clarence Thomas was\nHe got fifty two votes for confirmation buddy got sixty votes for cloture\nSo Democrats had two votes to get it out of committee right to sort of end debate with sixty votes fifty to all the voter foreign but they were Democrats who voted to end the conversation and move it to a vote\nYeah indirectly uh because no one in vote filibuster and and I think I I think what we're at a point in time McGraw and Jennifer where we need senators like\nA Evan by and jak Dan for Nancy Kass a bomb and Sam Nunn David born to come together to formulate some system of rules to save the United States Senate from the Senate doors because\n[noise] nine ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three\nPeople for for police\nGhost of the restaurant middle the with the stomach problem\nMy fear of flying\nTo sound like you if it does he could be one of the many people with a digestive condition called ... pancreatic insufficient C.

worth more than one point for now\nAnd it did not shred completely Jeff halfway\nHalfway yeah yeah wow that was a great story how about this one I like this one\nA woman named a parole ... tell Joe the gas station in Jacksonville, Florida the reason why I like this this story so much as I Want gambling in a casino in Kansas one time and I saw\nA sign on the casino floor that said\nIf you are on oxygen\nAnd you smoke could you please go outside\nSo it wasn't it was a it was a made it wasn't like handwritten with a with a sharp ... it was a maid signed\nClearly they were having a problem with people on oxygen smoking that they were asking these people to go outside so you don't blow everybody up right so that's how the how much trouble are we in when you have to create a sign that says\nMore than my bra how's it going to start freaking about a freaking out over the blues or no\nI mean I don't think a a freak out as an order they certainly aren't as good as we thought they were going to be out of the game um but but you know two games they started Brett out last year and that that didn't help him too much by the time I was over I think it's not so much\nThe record it's how is that and that's kind of what what Mike yo what's thing after after the law the Blackhawks um he's really disappointed with this team he's he went as far as calling them\nEverything but soft or said they were playing ah you know basically kid hockey they need to get up or they need to care more about everything else scoring that he's going to start playing guys you want to win as opposed to a guy who just want to score was really Congress laying into his team um after\nThat a lot of the black hawks when they gave up to leave them and lost and over time I think on top of that you're disappointed by the\nEnd of the the opportunity that was squandered a little bit I mean the city was wide open for\nBlues hockey their agent for it the the buildings renovated it looks outstanding the cardinals are out of the post season that it's you know everybody's ready for hockey season and they go out late to eggs in\nThat disappointing when you had a chance to really kind of capture the capture the attention span to get people really fired up with all these new players and they and they ah you know they were twice and now they now they have a practice or to get back at it Thursday um but there was certainly I think a little bit of an opportunity lost and lost her students\nOr could you imagine if an NFL playoff game ended at midnight on a Sunday [laughter]\nNo I Can't um and uh I I mean they they do last a long time but it you think that you would think that the baseball could get that figure it out a little bit better um I think sometimes these\nThese other we go up against the NFL hurt themselves by but not really\nThinking I'm you know it makes you put some of the biggest events on the other sports that sort of its biggest event um baseball goes you know starts to Leighton goes too late and and I think it's a fair question we're talking about illegal needs to do more to get the attention the young kids I think that's a fair point\nHere's what I don't understand about it they're they're pretty smart and it's all based on television I get it right so why start the game so that they finish at midnight who is watching baseball at midnight if they're trying to grow again\nHabit on when when the kids and the rest of us are up watching the game\nWell\nYeah I mean the die hard you're going to watch it right but if you're talking about growing the audience I don't know that you're going to let the kids stay awake\nI'm physically can stay away ... try and let them stay still can't stay awake\nRight I mean to me it's it's it's this is the most exciting point of the baseball season I mean no one will argue that postseason baseball is it something different I mean it's just it's it's special electric gets on\nSo put as much of it on and prime time as you can and use your leverage to put the TV is to make that happen these leaks just sell themselves for the TV and they'll just do whatever it wants and you know we talk about this when we talk about pace of play and link the games\nYou know sending the time to catch you can't go visit the picture that some of the game it's not going to cut\nThe time to catch you can't go visit the pitcher that maybe some of the game it's not going to cut down on the on the link or a game that much working with the TV's TV broadcasters broadcast companies to actually cut back on the amount of commercial time that would make a difference\nAs well but but I'm not afraid\nTo do any of that stuff they just they just kind of design that whatever TV ONE they'll get off and everybody else just falls in line but if if they would actually get some leverage back and maybe realized that that they're they're the product and maybe they could maybe they can make some commonsense solution here but there's no sign of that\nWe're ... we're looking at the the running the show the other day the game\nStarted at seven thirty seven\nSo they had thirty seven minutes of people talking about the game so\nThat the game could then end well past eleven thirty outside of prime time\nIt makes no sense if that's the case and if midnight is the best time to put on a game spin the super bowl would end at midnight\nRight I mean it's just ridiculous and baseball is killing its own and you talk to these people and they look at you know you're you're wrong McGraw ending a game at midnight makes a lot of sense yeah\nNo I I'm actually with you on that rarely I Know a very rarely agree on things but uh you know that it just it it to me is one of those things that the league would just stand up and say we're not going to do that any more than\nThe companies will want to give them the day I mean they want to put them on TV so you know it's like they just say well to be on TV we have to do whatever he the\nOne but hold on to try to hold on a second hold on to get\nThings that people want to watch live anymore right or what was then you realize\nBut I wouldn't blame baseball for couch telling you the TV executives because\nIf you and I are new world tell them is the biggest TV executives and you and I are in charge of winning the game starts and ends right now you don't want it and it could go into overtime you could ever rain delay but you know you are a game is probably three and a half innings or a a three and a half hours\nYou would want that game as a television executive to end at nine thirty nine o'clock nine thirty nine forty five right I guess that would be the best time so as TV executives I don't know what they're doing because it doesn't make any sense for them to have the game end at twelve thirty\nYeah that's for one but I'd rather just complain about how long it is and instead of actually moving the\nClinton more reasonable jak\nCommercials and another thing that they could do might be to ah you know you have a ... system that kind of dictates commercial linked then and the amount of break time of breaks based on the time of the game you know that's like you'd never discuss you know the baseball players they're sitting around waiting for these\nAre these commercials to go why don't you have it so if it's a longer game or if it's moving slower that you have your commercial focused over\nWell I think they should do\nYou have God Forbid that you have you know some sort of a an adjustable format where you can speed up the game if it's moving slow I talk about all these things the players\nAre definitely we don't talk about anything that the TV at the at the broadcast you know the the states should do differently even though that they're the ones that they're they're the biggest reason these games takes off\nI think what they should do is they should at least in the early rounds stagger\nIt like the NCAA Basketball does right have each game starts Fifteen twenty minutes apart so that\nAn average fan can watch the last three innings the last two winnings of each game and sort of get excited about it now I'm a hunting and pecking trying to figure out what channel what game what time and it's it's it's a it is as confusing as a Rubik's Cube\nYeah I mean I think it's a I think it's a fair topic of discussion certainly seems like the ...\nThe NFL people know when it is people note Super Bowl Sunday they know they're going to have their party right now I get it there's more games and and the ... you're you're playing in a series of different um but but it is it is something\nThat I think they have to look at say how can it can be improved I don't know the playing later and later into the night as a as a way to do that your your car get market for the most part is probably going to stay up for the folks who are going to be you know the folks that you want to see the next generation they're not going to be not going to be up for that they might set for a World Series\nBut uh you know they're not going to stay up for you know in in the U. S. or or DSM and those are those are exciting important games too so between that multiple channels in the end and different start times and\nAnd the ones that are going late I think I think it is a way for baseball look at how can we make this better we talk a lot about growing the game and getting new fans are we actually doing something that could help\nA band once you work on that for me to get back to the next time\nI got to try to figure out what's wrong with the football and the and the blues first but after after I did vote for her to a crowded up on that\nLater the gentleman Ben ... and you uh read them an F deal today dot com he's with us on Mondays and the sports guys then I'd been ...\nBy age twenty eight big five fifty K. T. R. S. you know somebody who has an addiction probably\nUh this uh epidemic has\nThis opioid epidemic as heroin epidemic has touched every community every high school a virtually every family out there and uh if you know someone or or ask for advice or what do we do or how do we go about tell them about ...\nParker is the assistant recovery centers of America arc or for short the website is arc of Midwest dot com Percy ... is just a true godsend to the regents\nHe realizes that addiction comes in many different forms and it's not one size fits all ark it uses drugs like no tricks zone and Vivitrol\nIt's an individualized program customize treatments to the individual so that they use the best practices to get the individual the addict back up on their feet just because they're an addict doesn't mean they're a bad person they are addicted and they need help drugs or alcohol called Argo\nHas been the hell's\nThe private hotels can handle this\nYeah hasn't um conventions spending by businesses isn't that down significantly over the last ten Fifteen Twenty years\nSo it dropped an awful lot as you can imagine after two thousand one or it has picked up in the last few years but almost every city is making the same argument for St Louis and frankly Kansas City are making which is we need to get into this market and uh and it just isn't\nIt isn't working a convention attendee isn't dramatically up or maybe it's catching up to where it was at the beginning of the of the two thousands but it's not a growth market\nYou know and and checking up taxes in order to attract conventions doesn't make yourself more appealing doesn't increase your you know competitive advantage you know frankly we should let the private sector take care of it\nYou know I I again I agree with you in theory and you're in Kansas City in your football team is the five an\nHour old football team is also ... but they're building a stadium in Los Angeles because we thought tooth and nail one of the reasons not the only reason but we fought tooth and nail not to give them one more nickel to build another stadium and so great we stayed do our principles\nAnd uh we didn't build them a stadium and now they're five an hour in another town so\nI mean you know it's it's one of those I agree with all in theory but you know\nThe St Louis doesn't have a football team because of it\nWell you know he's building like the uh stadium by himself and say in uh Los Angeles he didn't get the subsidy there that tells me he probably wanted to move to Los Angeles regardless I think it was\nA matter of getting a better deal than Los Angeles I think he just wanted to move but the question you have to ask yourself is\nYou know St Louis going to do the right thing or is it going to get in line with all these other areas for for more bad ideas because 'cause that's the game they play whether it's conventions are stadiums or anything else you know Amazon or Boeing\nAh these big businesses show a little bit of a leg and say to the localities what are you going to do to win a sober and these localities all over themselves to throw money at them and it's a it's a game that I mean these are losing\nWe should also note that didn't didn't Arabs they didn't go through a massive renovation with taxpayer dollars in the not too distant future and not just about\nA yes absolutely we we paid a whole bunch of money to uh to to renovate the stadiums and again we're we're we're spending money on billionaires so that they don't have to do with themselves and yeah it's a shame\nIt's a it's a tough call and I get it and and I I I agree with you I Wish there was a way where we could mutually disarmed together\nUm you know it's like a politician as as you know what I'm not going to run these negative ads because it's wrong and then everybody else run negative ads against him and he loses and he's like okay well if if I Want to run the negative ads I Would have had a shot but you can't mutually disarm by yourself\n[noise] no I think you're right within Missouri and and among the states we need to come to some agreement because we're all being played a proposals\nYou have a ... with
