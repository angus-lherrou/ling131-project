doubt that Taylor Swift will receive any a career benefit from her statement so I I Greg courage to both of them they spoke their minds even if it may have angered me the base of their uh popular

[noise]\n\n\n\nIs that time again flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just for all we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa ... off a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season it's going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it's going to be\nExactly and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team there was something they need to realize and that is a a flu virus was a very sneaky thing that keeps changing honest [noise]\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly [noise] um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season it to the next day the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year [noise]\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nSo last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's your seasons we had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand that's um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected\nAll age groups across the age spectrum very severely laughing\nAnd really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um all of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have that and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year on the two basic types if he\nWanted to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease\nAnd then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competing to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm One of the\nMany things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nFor the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against flu every year every year we were told you sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flu and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventative strategies things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu anti viral medicines take those medicines\nFour hundred zero for three five eight eight eight four hundred zero for three five and drove four hundred dot com\nIs the home of

I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that I heard\nOf that I'm the same on Billy not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to ah to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is at this stage I\nThink Clint alarming today black people in this state like if they had had had the ongoing arrest record in healthy people arrested for twenty five thirty than out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like if they have\n[noise] um yeah ship it replaces me as well of course\n[noise] uh\nYes it it ... me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times\nAnd convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of any of what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying then yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight for the good evening Orlando\n[noise] yeah [noise] I was on your mind to hire so I'm fine\nI was I going to say where I have a lot and you know or something like that so many chances I was also looking at it from that angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system and as I say\nEspecially compared to other developed countries [noise] and I think the CEOs of mental health\nIs even more I served radicals that are all and so maybe after somebody goes and stuff like science yeah they bought the offer of Asian people overall\nMaybe they could have a thing for a a foot feet long and so from Asia where they take a specialized health as well\nAnd they get help and maybe if\nI got I think it's more acceptable at first place\nOr whatnot right yeah to that place in our minds they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are that's why I've asked but then we have things like that and how much money was right by the FBI investigation\nThat the financial part of it and then the other side and that's how the snow is able to help somebody and prevent that from happening on the first place\nThat's just slice less especially yeah especially somebody could be better buildings bombs and they got lucky they got\nAlso got that something actually happens and people get the answer for that something like that with a little bit of and that's something I see is priceless\nWell why am I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect the brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of
