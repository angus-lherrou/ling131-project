lot of what we've been saying here I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way [noise] that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies [noise]\nThe less likely to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one on one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what a bribery both surprised about is\nThat we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first and it's the Canadians whose economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an ethanol take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless you're less than developed country\nSome real advantage and making something versus another country for instance supposedly a and here's the example I use in classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they meet coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing wheat we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like the Columbia let's say and South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat in order to know how do they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of weight on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U.S specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in jets making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for your wheat\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources so\nFree trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say\nAnd the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example\nThat make just sweet anybody making coffee is out of a job and say well you can go make we cite\nThe skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else\nBut they say we don't want to do something else yeah we want to continue to make their products for and that's what the rub is what what Canada All right\nTo recall from Sharon

of what is in this [noise]\nLet's talk to David new calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening [noise]\nYes I Do in your guest again out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably sort of five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact uh if you lower just the dollar value at at the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken bridge and I was defective when it when it opened\nTheir ... are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel oh yeah and what was said okay well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant thought it was the governor and this question what's the right okay yeah or it\nWas a Republican governor and labor on was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely customs\nAnd see they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nYou know each part had to have an inspector massive heart each almost to the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery under parts yet it was over written by a project manager who had no right to override it\nThat that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I guess the professor\nAnd regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I guess a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese [noise] up to a code in Rochester, Minnesota

your drums in and you knew him down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to throw away the rotors because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper\nBut the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of dealing with the Chinese [noise]\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a boom at Walmart Judy ... looking for the the\nThe the nice was broom out there you want some little sweep the floor or something like ... well I mean in the case with the break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe you will die or is that the other problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities that we had a question some time back about\nAfrica was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] that's that's all and other products like steel obviously quality is essential especially we're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the smaller consumer products look at the textile industry so it's a California is to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt but settled for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource up like the ... the shirts in China where people are\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so that they can make the shirt and sell it settled for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people say that's a very positive staying\nA regular them that people lose jobs here but it's positive but not all consumers now can purchase much more of goods and services because the prices are a lower except for the worst\nWork who can't afford anything at all [noise] I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy's tricky Iran consumers [noise] uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened to the twenty sixteen presidential election [noise]\nThat's right uh so uh up until Donald Trump ... but we thought was well look let's try and get these products to consumers that the lowest possible price even if you

I don't have a problem or a [noise]\nIt right at the same drank in eighty everybody\nSays is adequate says that he did not sever blackout [noise] I don't disagree I think that was a play and that that's where I have a big problem in court\nI used to I used to drink a lot either but blacked out either I I I I drank too much and there were times when I should have stopped and frankly these days are they ever drink at all\nI may be in this calendar year we're in October I maybe had maybe eight or nine drinks this entire year but uh I drank too much and I didn't like the idea that if you drink at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\n[noise] I don't know\nIf you drink as it is not true [noise] [noise] [noise] so he says ... certainly either way [noise] I just uh trying that hard to believe and I\nI mean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue is not whether or not he at one time ESPN blacked out a better than all of a self is not what's at issue where the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody\nI mean for example I uh I I drank too much of an occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\nLose interest in the world you know\nHe's never been

lot of what we've been saying you're I think goes to the very core of a problem but I have always seen with the sort of thing and I guess I could summarize it this way [noise] that the more that a free trade zone involves disparate economies [noise]\nThe less likely to succeed and again that's just right off the top of my head and I never got past econ one oh one but it just strikes me\nThat a disparate economies don't work things out so well so I think what I'd probably both surprised about is that we worked out this deal with by far the weaker less developed of the three North American economies Mexico first and it's the Canadians\nWhose economy is much more similar to ours with whom we're having the biggest trouble so if you would address my theory a professor you may give me an a through an F and I'll take my lumps go ahead [laughter]\nWell let me let me say this um you're you're you're correct um unless you're less than developed country has some real advantage and making something versus another country for instance\nSuppose the uh and here's the example I use the classrooms um suppose the the the U.S needs a week and they meet coffee\nSo we're very efficient at producing we we have the right climate for it we use small amount of resources get a large amount of we were not so good at making coffee we don't have the right climate for it we can use a lot of resources and not get much coffee\nA country like a Columbia let's say in South America is just the opposite\nThey don't have the climate or to grow wheat in order to know how they have to use a lot of resources and get a little bit of wheat on the other hand they have a great climate for growing coffee and they're good at it so they use a little bit of resources to get a lot of coffee what happens they say\nSuppose the U.S specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources so\nFree trade benefits everybody well why somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee and my example\nThat make just sweet anybody making coffee is out of a job they say well you can go make we cite\nThe skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has a very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens to the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else\nBut they say we don't want to do something else yeah we plan to continue to make their products for and that's what the rub is what what Canada All right\nTo recall from Sharon
