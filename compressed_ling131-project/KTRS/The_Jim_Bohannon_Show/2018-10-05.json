don't understand that Google ... they make them ... ... what happened to it and I is that that ... [noise]\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has this search engine called safari\nSafari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google have apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go with that said the president I think that is that is going to change eventually biggest star page is becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges them best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google but the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either steer you manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that banks\nWhich is the Microsoft products which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google a centrally in twenty sixteen struck a commercial agreements a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement we don't know exactly what that agreement is\nBut um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google and a lot of people believe that there is some kind of arrangement where they're doing a search they're cooperating in search so that's\nPart of the challenge there really aren't that many great alternatives\nWe'll be back in a moment much think about customers nation presented by

and that just you know the credibility is just ridiculous [noise] I think you have to have this in my opinion because if if it drags on any longer [noise] I think he's got to get it [noise]\nAnd ah if he does it end this stuff but I really do believe he's going to get it\nAt this juncture appear so I I\nThink that that that is that I as I say it's safer to lean that way that the not so yeah I'm I'm with you Dave I think that you're correct uh absolutely again or if someone is genuinely sexually assaulted I'm sure it must be a terrible trauma that most of us can only imagine\nFine I accept that our sympathies go to you [noise] uh and I will assume that that you are in fact were sexually assaulted you'll have the benefit of the doubt but when you go we're making charges against somebody else

election at it carried out nobody is giving any uh whatsoever on ...\nMinutes Joe Donnelly for those who don't know he is the Democratic senator from Indiana and uh again that of course the state carried by heavily by by President Trump uh that's that's interesting that that you couldn't even or even get a any takers on that I I find that remarkable\nUsually usually somebody will take it at least as a joke that Trump was out here about two weeks ago mhm and lab was simple and you know of course and Republican candidates so it looks like he's right on the edge of a Roach now I'd say he's gone\n[noise] well it'll be very interesting to see how are the votes of these senators from uh from questionable states in fact a a a will affect their their election outcome as I say I think Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nHas filled in a way almost liberated because she's trailing so badly but I think that all she wants to as a cabinet position in a democratic administration I knew I Would suspect that uh that she probably cannot rescue that seat in North Dakota\nDown thirty for down thirty points sense does it get caught manage tonight I understand\nIt the vice it to say that ah that

Sunday but if we lose this boat\nIt's come up this way we can move the wedding to Sunday but if we lose this vote it will affect the entire country I've heard people say just what you just said and and my answer would be no\nNo that that's more important I mean it is not like your your daughter is not going to get married let her get married tomorrow or are there in this case if you're talking about senator able to get married Sunday uh he does say that he will at the his daughter's wedding in Montana and uh uh\n\nThis is an interesting thing right here though there's been an unusual late lied phone call in which senator Danes of Montana Heidi Heitkamp colleague called cabinet and personally a short and that he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed [noise]\nSo uh but for whatever that's worth a I guess he's found a way around this so uh that's the short answer on that one that he has a he has promised Kavanaugh if he needed he will be there so again a law that\nMakes me feel better it left me feel better too I got to tell you Steve I had been the bothered about that and I just reached checked the wires here and ah\nThe GOP could hold the session opened by the overnight and allow Danes to vote on Sunday if needed to be a a whether or not the cabinet or\nA a whether or not they deserve promised to Capitol I mean people would appear for hypothetical Sunday vote is not clear but the GOP good old the session open overnight\nOr that could happen so technically uh in the Senate parlance that would mean that a Saturday would be a Sunday would be redefined the Saturday or they could do that and and I'll guarantee you if it came down to the point where let's say it is a\nIt is fifty to forty nine against Kavanaugh okay\nAh I'll guarantee that's what the Republicans will do and then the Danes will fly and quickly make it a fifty fifty tie had been pins with gas to tie breaker so that clarifies that for me I I had been

or something they believe that it said you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you why I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about dead and I think ... um I Would ask you I mean do you think it has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing death opposition\nI think it does a talented and in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating\nA law that did not have any basis in the constitution but what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states\nAnd each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it true the issue of person who could because if we would accept the biological factors just do the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nIn the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be\nIn protecting lights worthy and the pursuit of happiness and would provide due process and would make it impossible\nFor anyone to deprive a person of bear a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because there should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here am I then I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little checking your calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five
