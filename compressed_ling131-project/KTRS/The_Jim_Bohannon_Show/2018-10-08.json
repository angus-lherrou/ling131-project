about the road to hell it is often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of a veterans of that particular conflict\nRetired brigadier general build David and a retired lieutenant colonel Michael L R B and also another military veteran retired air force colonel Randy Larson the executive producer and director of the new documentary film\nOr is that there was brought up I I think that it's it's a good time for you to inject this before we return to the other two guests are Randy and that would be\nA of the uh the bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way but how how serious was that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see an outright opposition to what your job like you\nKnow there was no opposition and they were trying to put a documentary on the gathers a nine month\nIt's a marathon to turn the page in the spring when they get the facts right\nAnd as a lot of different ... nobody's been married for ... you know one of the most important things and that story is you know all the military ... us troops are simpler by George Herbert Walker Bush because we're starting to death in ... in the morning and kept it I'm not so\nWe had to send troops over there we went there for humanitarian reasons I admit it or getting the incredible All right\nAll senior military leaders in the show the man said we need some armored vehicles over there are groups throw she him one case and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel hat\nAnd secretary defiance laughed at me and said no we're not going to send them so when general day it was all the time and and and and ... he was a major like when they had to go out there and rescue\nAnd and and and colonel Allen but he was a major at the time when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers after helicopters got shot down they had to go get the laser an armored personnel carriers\nTroops out ... us troops in there the U.S

everybody from the AFC ... or ...\n... and CEOs who are incredible the senior and you know and and the leaders like a a building but might that one day and that's a nice should really be talking to here because first of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not gonna give you the resource that you say your age\nAnd I just so proud that we get the honor the ... Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which it was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact has been that long but I remember\nA severely castigated a defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know the images is baloney although I was using stronger language ... let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or\nThat in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nOr what and which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that should have been made available to you\nOut Jim I I think a commander with a would always want more resources but I think the um\n[noise] I'm really officers\nWho were in command positions senior to me it made it very clear to the national command authority you said ...\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and I'm the best way to protect our force so yes obviously um [noise] you know the more armor you're going to have around your anytime she was a pretty good thanks um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it\nOn the situation dictated that we use ... and so that's what we\nDid that is true and I was raped or yeah or else please continue ran a yes\nOr no I just want they build David my that would be went into the gunfight that night in a hungry and an armored Humvees and light like that in a trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible or getting a parade everybody shooting that and they were in a on armored on be more than a thousand people too\nAnd we all recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ... and ... ... ...\nUh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee right\nWhy that is true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the safely taxi right up there and it's just not rations that were designed to be starving Somalis I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going into into a firefight and I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years at a lot to think about it when we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in my perspective it's not a peaceful about those kinds of operations\nIn this case you had a set of whether it's you have to drive about having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by the power who was the uh the the thing that I had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In it escalated and then there were things that occurred back in June and July with the the house raids\nAnd I don't think the Bush at home recognize that there was a firefight\nOr until we got the three were up and so I think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out a theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public would have to think the defense secretary Aspen have that information\n[noise] I think that's probably true but I'm not sure that he had the ability and I can't really speak for aspirin I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that uh I was around on the ground have at the time\nAnd that was that generally speaking\nThere was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to that either D.C or back to to ah to send them to indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure that everybody really understood firefights we'd already been in

[laughter] I thought he was my second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\n[laughter] you know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know

I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them to take that just about anybody fighting in something they believe that it said you should just be so proud of your daughter I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you why I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nThat concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think catalog or I Would ask you I mean do you think it has more to do about abortion does anything out of work habits are facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow in in in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and ah revisit a borough the weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution\nWhat most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it true the issue a person could [noise] because if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that every person is a person from the point of conception\nIn the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be\nIn protecting life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and would provide due process and would make it impossible\nFor anyone to deprive a person of bear a life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with this because this shouldn't be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping

Amazon and I ...\nDo you still get to have a Facebook page [laughter]\nWell you know it's interesting I'm a year to ... when we initially set up the trailer we actually had some glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is a ... who's this a PHD used to always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how Google could swing an\nElection uh well you know one direction or the other uh by shifts\nAnd a lecture in a while you know one direction or the other uh by shifting millions of votes spy controlling the information they got a Washington Post ran a story on\nThis ... and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight and the felt use a a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocks and by Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his concept so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power that this company has to\nDecide if they're aware of them\nAre how they are going to control what you see what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites I mean that's why they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that example you just gave our our particularly no worthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the oil being that that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that ...\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was all five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that people got out some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some or the Republicans were Democrats independents\nAll kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found one they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google and every single search position of the\nTop ten search results\nIs that results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nShelter results at the end of the day [noise] um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is ... is essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nI and what he is concerned about of course it's not a political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of go into the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one eight six six five oh Jim

stretched to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what his name is\nLet's go to David who calls in from San Francisco divide the David good evening\n[laughter] yes I grew up in your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major of financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably shorter five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right right yeah and in fact if you remember just a dollar value uh at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake\nThey said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion and financing to it with the well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich and I was defective when it when it opened [noise]\nAre you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel\nOh yeah and what was going well I didn't know then yeah and what was significant about it or not was the governor\nOkay well I didn't know then yeah and what was significant about it or not was the governor\nAnd this crush more today right okay yeah ... was a Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating apart so it was almost entirely customs\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each part had to have an inspector massive march ... almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override it\n... that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese\nWill have to uh current in Rochester, Minnesota is a next door below courage\nI yeah well the thing that bothers me about the uh to steal from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes three done he may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor they it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take your break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them but nowadays everybody has to you throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper\nBut the quality is also cheap\nOr All right I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest broom out there you want something that will sweep the floor but does something like this you know well I mean a indicates will break drums a ... that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe will die out is that the other problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of qualities you'd do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality [noise]\nYeah that's that's always an issue of products like steel obviously quality is a essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile industry so if the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that\nThey made a real they shared that sold for fifty dollars well\nThey decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time were paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more uh goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all [noise] I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy's strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted in in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the ... presidential election\nThat's right uh so uh up until Donald Trump\nThe the thought was well look let's try to get these products to the consumers that the lowest possible price even if you have to sacrifice a low quality get it at the lowest possible price that means consumers will be able to buy more things", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "08"}
