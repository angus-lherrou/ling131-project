a show at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss co written with Martin do guard\nIs already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which became an enormous salary a lot of material leftover biggest Patton\nWas an occupier in southern Germany uh before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was [noise]\nAnd many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union which is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing a bad one actually fight them you wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA that took over from the OSX did\nThe enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get ... people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich Hamel or their head of the ss one of the most of our human beings ever walked the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse that Germany was going to lose him with he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa [noise]\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took a big guys and we took it I man and mangled Klaus Barbie the Bush early on that and more women\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kinda we prove that in the book my dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... says people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university [noise]\nAnd you wouldn't World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the ... go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if people to all that couldn't happen yeah it it it it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\n[noise] but I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth that is there any kind of justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed\nTo justify who want to this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did hail and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black males\nTo go after it off Eichmann and they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to leak it to the press that you're not going to go after I who who did that and that and that forced force Truman to do it\nWho who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear that\nWe named the man I'm that if Truman didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps [laughter]\nAn insult true very true and was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about the uh just a a a a tad bit if you will or some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of

I think a lot of these Democratic senators running for reelection they're going to pay a heavy price of the polls are they sort of hope they do\nThey may uh let me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I Do consider an excuse at all but I Do think that this was the reason you're talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course of things go down this path in the Democratic establishment\nWould not in the general course if things go down this path\nIn the Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hubs of those on the far left they ever

think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I had with it if these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh [noise]\nWhy didn't they bring up the ... race stories back X number of years ago when

Would like to think you're correct I don't think so and I I Would put it this way I Would not what anybody out there to base their decision on voting\nBased on the fact that it's in the bag I don't think it's anywhere near in the bag probably in the Senate Republicans will gain seats because it is simply a too many Democrats are are heavy seats to defend I figure three or four seats myself in the house\nIt is entirely possible that we will see the return of Speaker Pelosi and then the the notion that everybody has motivated the way that you and I are I just don't think it's necessarily

eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the titles you'll say oh well I Know\nLike most of the things that bill is tackled you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary and a lot of material leftover biggest pad and [noise]\nUh was an occupier and southern Germany\nUh before he was a killer met his death in a hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat in and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we've got to use these captured Nazis to spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember from killing a bad one actually fight them he wanted to fight Stalin yeah so that's what the new CIA that took over from the ... did\nThe day and listen to a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people to spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich Hamel or that or the ss one of the most vile human beings ever to walk the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year or before the third Reich collapse that Germany was going to lose him with the way he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization [noise] and so they help these guys get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened [noise]\nAnd also the America and not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland help them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa [noise]\nAh it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out what took and big guys I went to a guy men andme angle a Klaus Barbie the Bush early on that and more and more men\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we prove that in the book by dental work [noise] so ... it's a compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you\nKnow Jim ... these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university you want to World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the debt said just go on a cap and ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWould just ordinary people are just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if the people that couldn't happen yeah it it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here at the moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two uh certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed\nTo justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did hail and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black males\nTo go after it off Eichmann it they had to say if you don't Mr President and we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and that that forced forced Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who black males and\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that after two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people he knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about the uh just a a a a tad bit if you will lessen hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and uh it is a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term
