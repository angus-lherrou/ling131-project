at\nThings that are might possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls for Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\nHow are you doing Mr Bannon I'm\nFine thank you [noise]\nUm I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is\nHow the liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get ... you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and it's not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit but we know they're conservatives do nothing like the cave constantly there the\nThe party of appeasement and they need some on this got some site and then in just says no we're we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated Kevin that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight [laughter] you know where you can fight they put up\nYeah the ... that's ... that's a good point I Would I guess to to address it I I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the notion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if we put up by a liberal justice so we start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is a strategy voted disgusting practice [noise]\nBut uh I was wondering uh have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent picks for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice in a nominee as qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person there for anything and everything is fair game [noise]\nWell I think if you look at it from the perspective of those Republicans could follow the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do at least in this issue and the and the the or a collegial bunch of\nPeople which I'm not too sure that pays off in a more collegial being collegial doesn't work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness\nWhen you were in a bar fight and that's what we just witness frankly you know I [noise] I remember\nBack when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and [noise]\nAnd you know I had some good teachers back then people who weren't really afraid to uh to to speak out coal a spade a spade and say look you know people do this but it's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work now is a ... it's almost like a a a\nPitch battle you know a food fight and what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a [noise] the the Ford\nAccusations and [noise] and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs three is just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both used and it would probably be the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public\nOr what we witnessed with a judge can now justice cab at all or was it just deplorable if not despicable and uh you know I I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty or press and the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just hold up this really has fired up the Republican base it's like\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim and they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this war\nWell we'll see certainly both basis seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon and crane Missouri yellow\n... than you know whole justice Kavanaugh\nConstitution that I'd like to get to get I Want to make life than to the academic than the court why then followed cats [noise]\nAnd so I'm not going to be happy with that well I may go against something that I think in the constitution man I Will I Will abide by that support it I tired yes\nCork a making law than they are not supposed to get that back it's Congress that want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job presidents yeah their guys and they did they show branch to do their\nJammed for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice do today was well you look at the constitution that aforementioned constitutions [noise]\nAh the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe presidency that the chief executive officers the cabinet heads of the like and then you come of course to the article free the or the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because their sense of judicial power of United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd in such inferior records as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave [noise]\nYeah and I think we also know if you if you study the laws really will you should just uh on the lower federal courts and and there's even been some mentioned I think ... in New York [noise]\nThat that is the liberal democratic congressman going on\nYeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to um [noise] a recall get rid of justice Kavanaugh\nOr you can only do that by impeaching and convict\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just [noise] ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extreme missed some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nThough I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has a has Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York either New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency [noise] if the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump and possibly Kavanaugh\nThey'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I've gone to lose any sleep over

Missouri yellow\nHearing I Can't you know for justice Kavanaugh\nConstitution I Want to get to it I Want to make I don't like them to be the best on the court I why then followed that cats [noise]\nAnd so I'm not going to be happy with that all go against something that I think parents dictation man I Will I Will abide by that support it I get tired of this\nWork a ... law than they are not supposed to do that is kind of job that I Want everybody to get that cap Congress' job pets get yeah they're guy and they did they show branch that they\nCan for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just note that today as well you look at the constitution that aforementioned constitution\nOr the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe presidency of the the chief executive officers the cabinet heads and the like and then you come of course to the article free the the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave [noise]\nYeah and I think we also know if you if you study the law is really will you should just the on the lower federal courts and and there's even been some mentioned I think ... New York\nThey added that is the liberal democratic congressman go ahead\nYeah and it it he's apparently already talking about are trained to um [noise] a recall get rid of justice Kavanaugh\nOr you can only do that by impeaching him convicted\nI Know and and just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nYou know I'm sure they do that after this appeals to the base which increasingly has a as Democrats rather nervous\nOr after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York either New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency [noise]\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare

American fabric you know we talked earlier about a\nLaw enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers\nWere formed Eighteen twenty three places Austin alright I'm\nIn the idea is that the when the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they they go to trade they do do things stand a fire or whether it might have been a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody behaved ... most people behave themselves\nAnd I think he looks at the historic context of how fire which were were really part of the ... the American fabric at and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little living at\nBecause semi automatic pistols or protect their so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the term that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and yeah I can defining assault rifle for you right now that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip [noise] that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nWell I think you just paint that because quite frankly that term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition love it\nAnd you know they this dates back I didn't twenty five thirty years we've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then\nAnd when when Dianne Feinstein opened her questioning\nOf the judge Kavanaugh\nThe first thing she turned to was good news and and the ... he's a\nDissenting opinion which really was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles and and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on this and print she said what about the hundreds of school shootings that we've had over the years involving assault rifles\nThat was just hogwash\nAnd I don't know where she gets this stuff but uh too many in the media especially the meaty inside the beltway or don't have the still wants to call people out on this kind of thing they needed this rhetoric gets way overboard and\nIn many cases they don't have the knowledge to call her out on it\nWell yeah you're right they don't and\nHow many is on ever fired a gun I mean is there any\nWay too many of them agree with her and I I guess that's where I cut my little niche in journalism I'm a ... some people would call and good and I understand the subject\nA die hard target shoot I used to compete in action pistol shooting matches at my gun range I reload my own ammunition saw you know I'm a demon but I understand that", "year": "2018",
