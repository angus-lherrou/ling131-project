it's not only for me at the other people that they can\nSplit it with a different party at the different parties were actual one that's out there in some cases already for at one another so even when they heard selling\nThings here and then the thing is going to happen in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again I I'm\nA ... in other words you have in in in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh the office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot\nBut I I don't see a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like\nFire houses in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mail box if you send another abs yeah ballot or or or a protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the or\nThe county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nWell what they call it it early elections are they going to vote early elections gets bad after a certain state they have to go for their kids to have these crazy

fall out later that after that I even heard\nOf that of that is\nIf it is the current\nData paint fun it really ...\nWell it is it's very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to ah to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of a suspect in the or the or the phony bombs denied\nThat thing that has always been I don't know if that's true at all of this case the clear why being a black people in his face like if they had had the ongoing of factory\nIn healthy people that were twenty and you're not on the street I guess that's the thing like if they have\n[noise] um yeah ship it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested the many many many times ah\nAnd ah convictions or what would matter in terms of ah of any ah what amounts to prior restraint but uh

at it from a pro active and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system and the sky and say that's actually compared to other developed countries\nAnd I think the field of mental health\nIs even more under served in the medical field that are all and so maybe after somebody goes and seven times\nYeah they bought the offer of Asian people overall maybe they could have a thing where they ah put people on mental probation where they they are specialists have as a health professional\nAnd health and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable in the first place [noise] person with that right yeah\nTo that place in their minds they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI investigation that the financial part of it and then the other side\nOf mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that's just slice less especially if the you know especially somebody could do better buildings bombs and they got lucky they get\nThe opposite go undetected something actually happens people get the answer for that something like that with a little bit of an aspect is that something I see is priceless\nWell widely anybody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to exact to do such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a [noise]\nA Seventy percent chance that the we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more
