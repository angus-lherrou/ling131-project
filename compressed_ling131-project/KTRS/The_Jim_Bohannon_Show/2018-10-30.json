[noise]\n... or ... flare heart chart and stuff you know age [noise] I mean I understand that there are people like myself who don't believe in religion I Believe in God I just all over the religious struck\nThat doesn't mean you have to go out to the same thing and heartening targets that's something the military is not you know Jane salt loving\n... in a in an ideal world I Would agree I I Would have to ask you before our judgments cards that David if you could give us some idea of just how we do this because there aren't too many magic wands available\nBeing human beings to one another very nice they ... you know having a national discussion so well Che yourself you know treat others treat yourself\nThat would be great if in fact we get people to do that but that doesn't alter the fact that there are many people who will simply laugh at that and go ahead and attack people anyway and I don't think that that I'll be extra need for hardening of targets I'd I'd love to live in such an ideal make believe world David but I don't think we do Bruce\nKnow Jim I agree as well listen if that were an option or if that were a particular approach or if that had worked in the past we wouldn't be talking about this today\nAnd I'm happy to say yes indeed let's do all we can in that direction just don't consider it a panacea\nIndy I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um I have spoken to some congregations where her from congregations that say even if they the option\nOf an armed guard were were viable for\nThem which in many cases it is\nSome of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've ... related to terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving and clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the the the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHeartening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there are I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have\nIt is certainly preferred to do that then it is to station the armed guards lives if they've David so concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a\nAn armed guard they're hardened target you know put the overlay of a hard and target and an armed guard\nI'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seeks to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so uh you know one\nYou know deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so uh you know on the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggesting we go to this is the I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is\nWe we we have heart in targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protected that's a form of art and target\nAnd when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot of scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hard as well too so let let's not parts too much on the word heart that you know heart and means to to shore up to the to defend where otherwise it hadn't been defended to strengthen to make more real bust them\nOut in about a less than a minute to go here if you could tell us what you do at security one solutions which isn't it ... by the way security the numeral one solution stock or\nShould you worry as security services provider ah we primarily operate in the government and the enterprise a space and ... you know at the simplest terms uh you know we protect people places and things\n[noise] All right uh suffice to say that uh\nThere are there are things that you can do out there it is not a case of a somebody throwing up your hands and uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea\nOf people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although obviously trying to reach people in their formative years is obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things to consider and to stay on

thirty cents\nBack to the gym but we had a job when I have six six five oh Jim bode day is in Fort Bragg North Carolina a good evening Dave\nJim thanks for taking my call through what kind of expand a little bit on what your last couple of callers have said and you know it shows a Trump they're Obama can take their own responsibility for what they said but I don't know wider scale I think that\nA lot of the actions that we're seeing are at an extreme behavior is fine but\nI think the American people are so frustrated with not seeing any leadership out of these politicians gym where you have watched the politicians decker and backed by and go ... at each other and the name calling for so long now and it's getting worse and yet we're getting ... productivity out of\nCongress's rating is lower than that of of a\nPlumber weekend rates you know I mean it's just\nYou know nothing's getting done I'll give you an example I called my congressman's office three times and I've asked specific questions about for example if there's a blue wave\nWhere his stand on the impeachment and I cannot get an answer I get there is like well you know we don't know that that's going to happen ... if it does here's what I Want to know where does the congressmen stand on impeachment she got to feel about words you're going to go when it when it hits the Senate I cannot get an answer and\nYou know Hillary was was a attribute here recently and she wouldn't answer but she said she wasn't going to run for president but she she wasn't running in twenty twenty but she wanted to be president shortly after that she made the climate it's going to take a lot of work to do all the damage that's being done\nIn the American people are following a lot of what has set a tone that's being set by all these politicians and you know during the Obama administration and there was a lot of it's not the way we are it's the right thing\nHowever he felt was the way the entire nation which to feel\nThat there's no doubt about the fact of colleges are not as responsible as they ought to be too many of them are frankly in the business of trying to stay in office they feel the way to do that used to not commit to anything to avoid confrontation\nAnd a commitment and that is probably the most compelling reason for for term limits right now which will only happen by the way we have an article by constitutional convention but the short answer is uh I agree with you day than I Do wish that things were better a can of Pittsburgh hello Ken\nGood evening I'm obviously a very sad time for a city but for the for the world yes\nUm I I think that this this isn't this goes back much further and I find blame it on the repeal of the communications act to thirty four\nI think the Internet has become a a place that people\nGather with like minded individuals and it's just like dogs too in a bone they just keep going around and around and you don't hear different points of view I mean you probably got one of the last national talk shows this summit can call in and talk on and here's some different Amos\nThe video games that I see are extremely violent\nAnd um we repealed the fairness doctrine so I just think that there's so much anger and hate I mean I I Can't believe how prison events one mile from where this individual live\nUh it's just it's just unbelievable and I just wish people would stop thinking about politics for a while\nAnd just keep sink and the fact that these eleven people died and something has to be done [noise]\nI I Would agree on one point that you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spin a bar too much time talking only to like minded people\nUh most people today spend their time with like minded people in person or on line on social media and uh that does tend to create an echo chamber and I agree with you\nThe fairness doctrine a is a great way to see to it that the multiple voices are in fact shut down a the parent is not good it was a terrible idea and we're better off because there's no longer here Steven edge or North Carolina good evening Steve\n... I Hope I can put a stop to gather as as they are but I Believe at some point that they that they made it seem like too many ... and my generation growing up there was severe consequences for what you see it\nIf you step outside of the law all I'm\nJust banned it alive thing you could disrupt a flight to have you with or\nNot only were you a huge things not only legal sanctions you face societal sanctions people would avoid you you would not be that and welcome at the uh the Rotary Club or a or in class uh and when we do some people like we used to and frankly that's a shame of\nWhat I'm getting to a bigger point here but just gone gotten out of getting to the to the parents they just type place but I think the mindset\nHas banned for a good while just like here in North Carolina a big thing was turned down a lot of Confederate statue\nThat not have gone to argue the different opinions on that but what I'm arguing that there is not paying eight judge that what\nYou can't go to our\nProperty and his band alive and tired I also just because the fans you [noise]\nWell unfortunately we don't\nTend to enforce that in terms of societal sanctions many of these people hang out with people who feel that way you only sections that they face regrettably are legal sanctions and in many case that there is the view of but look the other way or the the mayor of Baltimore ... during the rioting that took their place they're not too many months back\nSaid of of burning buildings let them burn as if somehow they feel aggrieved so we don't care if they're they're engaged in ours and the mayor of Baltimore should have been removed from office but that egregious behavior\nBut she certainly was not so\nI'm One of the thing I Would note\nA reference was made to do a fringe of being affected I've lost at least one friend and I suspect that other friendships have been injured shall we say uh with my friends that I have liberal friends if we disagree we simply don't talk about that we talk about the weather or sports [laughter]\nGoing to be taking a look at them versus us in a moment\nFor sports [laughter] going to be taking a look at them versus us in a moment\n\nDo you owe the IRS ten thousand dollars or more than you may qualify for the fresh start program\nThe folks had civic tax relief can give you free information on how it works they're professionals have over twenty five years of experience negotiating with the IRS that's critical they know the proper steps to take and the right people to contact to save you the maximum amount of money\nThey only go should your IRS taxes that plus protect you from banquet reason wage garnishment find out which program fits your situation best the information and consultation are absolutely free experience tax professionals are standing by they'll listen to your situation find out what you need and give you all the ways they can help in the first\nThree call again this information is free and could change your life so call now eight hundred six one Seventy nine Ninety One eight hundred six one Seventy nine Ninety One get your free information now call eight hundred six oh one Seventy nine Ninety One\nRage and grieve and worry about things that are far away from you that you can't do much about and we move for being active in the local community to being passed that digital community at a lot of that loneliness spills out as rage and it's one of the reasons that our politics look so deformed or the president while but\nWe'll continue our conversation with the ...

fellow I can recall ... air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on a porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse I remember when we got our first air conditioning units [noise]\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess that point why I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\nAnd I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory I'm so let me give you another one that that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point in the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new homes eyes now compared to the midnight in fifties but what are the things we know is that when your house gets larger and your life get large to get larger the separation from your neighbors get larger and you end up having fewer of those thick relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more and there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes ... but one of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back to act like I confessed we have at our house\nTo a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by there is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house but\nFrankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through together humans are relational beings we are social animals were not just mountains were verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people and\nA lot of times shared experiences even if they are imperfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue\nOn your under fourteen year old or on your seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem it's not about relationships or at least I don't think it is ... this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence sure ah\nThe next generation has been or opportunity is higher income or education and they live longer what happened [noise]\nYeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loan let us ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nThat would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems are and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent\nOf obesity is viewed as a phenomenal as well as sort of a downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends that people get lonely and then they get fat\nAnd so if the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folks\nAre obese but most of that as a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioid addictions overdoses suicides a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organization this is really new we've had\nPretty good public health data on what people die of\nFour eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time and the last six years at\nEven two years of declining like expectancy in Nineteen sixty two to Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy is you're toning Eighteen we're gonna have a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides at addictions that overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers most all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nConsequences but there was an interplay between declining economics and declining community\nSo bunch of places in America that we think about sort of the industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nIn neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the crises are vicious cycles\nRight that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we hate each other and how to heal what are your solutions [noise]\nI'll give you three or four big one's a number one we have to figure out how you

O. J. ... heart to heart ... and ... you know age [noise] I mean I understand that there are people like myself who\nDon't believe in ... I Believe in God I just believe in religion struck that doesn't mean you have to go out of two at the same thing [noise] and heartening targets that's something that the terrorists did not know chainsaw loving\n... in a in an ideal world I Would agree I I Would have to ask you before our guest responds that David if you could give us some idea of just how we do this because there aren't too many magic wands available\nShandling advance to one another nice they ... you know having a national discussion just felt well Che yourselves treat others I treat yourself\nThat would be great if in fact we get people to do that but that doesn't alter the fact that there are many people who will simply laugh at that and go ahead and attack people anyway [noise] and uh I don't think that that I'll be the need for hardening of targets I'd I'd love to live in such an ideal make believe world David but I don't think we do Bruce\nAh know Jim I agree as well listen if that were an option or if that were a particular approach or if that had worked in the past\nWe wouldn't be talking about this today\nAnd I'm happy to say yes indeed let's do all we can in that direction just don't consider it a panacea\n... ... I Would do too I I Would to David's point also say this is that um [noise]\nI have spoken to some congregations are her from congregations that say even if they the option of an armed guard were more viable for them much in many cases it is [noise]\nSome of them have very been very clear and expressing to me the fact that they don't want to do that they don't want to worship with\n'em an armed guard it almost gives them the feeling that they've capitulate at a terrorism or terrorism or the threat is driving in clearly that's an option you know clearly that is an option that's what they've chosen I also want to be clear is I'm not suggesting by any sense of the the the imagination and into your first point Jim\nHeartening every target is neither possible nor practical there's a men's cost there are I Am saying that within the confines of the or the options that you have it is certainly preferred to do that than it is to station the armed guards if if if David so concerned about\nThe image of the ... you know philosophy that it gives of of having a a an armed guard that there are a hardened target you know\nPut the overlay of a hard target in an armed guard there I'm suggesting of all of them heartening that target before you put a guard there at least seats to dissuade or deter or to protect from those that are inside of there so\nUh you know one of the spectrum of things I'm not I'm not suggested we go to this is the I think to the degree that David saying the other thing is is is\nWe we we have heart in targets every everywhere it's just the terminology we go to the courthouse ... you know you're the courthouses oftentimes protect that that's a form of art and target\nAnd when you fly from point a to point B you go through TSA checkpoint there's a lot scene and unseen things that go along there that target as hard as well too so that that's not parts too much on the word heart that you know heart and means to to shore up to to defend where otherwise it hadn't been defended to strengthen to make more robust yeah\nIn a less than a minute to go here if you could tell us what you do at security one solutions which is a website by the way security the numeral one solution stock I'm\nSure Jim worry as security services provider ah we primarily operate in the government and the enterprise a space and and you know at the simplest terms uh you know we protect people places and things\n[noise] All right uh suffice it to say that uh\nThere are there are things that you can do out there it is not a case of somebody throwing up your hands and uh and say do nothing nor is is the notion of trying to instill good will and people a bad idea but it is certainly no panacea\nOf people who engage in such activities are pretty much beyond that level of persuasion although obviously trying to reach people in their formative years is obviously something else to pursue\nAll of them of things to consider and to stay on the line Bruce we will
