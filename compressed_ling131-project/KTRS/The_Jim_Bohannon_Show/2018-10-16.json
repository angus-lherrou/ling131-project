the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling your call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat Senate starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the test the Monday from ... to fold so telling the truth\nThere's no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is this is what you get this\nPost modern is on this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics can be divided into two groups those who believe there as well I'm sure the ... and those that believe everything is relative\nTo those that believe that everything is relative um they\nThey create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\nWell what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there is this right\nWhile the other day that they'd have to fall into their own trials that have been no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the ... the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals are spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean the the the theory that the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America\nA band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country as such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it ... becomes the legal system we're short real law actually becomes the ... of the land\nOf whom were such as I gather style than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall\nBy the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies but he's a Muslim state\nBut we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talk about\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go or do you think that they overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming mid to lose\nAll the all the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves the socialists or in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nIs incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat body\nI've managed to socialize this would make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations advocated control of the education of our young people to people especially at the College of faculty level in many cases have\nAn absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology you are or less the less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that\nBut in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor and presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\nFired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me ...\nI couldn't agree more we abdicated the schools the high schools the colleges starting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as\nA as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the educational system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the bull headed show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n[noise] hell of a chance that hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject that sure it's an object that is true\nThat is it is claimed that

I was I run a business I have a number of employees and and what I think about health insurance oftentimes it's easy to think about that at a transaction\nThree out is that our health insurance premiums are derivative of the health care claims that\nWe can of race and health insurance just become healthcare financing that's really all it is and so\nAs health care costs continue to go up for some reason employers in the United states don't think about health insurance like they thinking about everything else on the piano and the economic principle applies here just does everything else the costs that I pay today is equal to the number of units that I consume multiplied by the price in which I consume them\nAnd so if an employer wants to do something to drive down costs and start

you are you wanted to ask Lawrence\nThat's good I think I can make my contribution now\nUm I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high\nA high also to specialize in psychiatry back in the days when I uh charge thirty and thirty five and forty dollars for the gym in an hour I actually made more money that way then over the years as it was higher and higher [noise]\nUh I Want to\nExpress my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happened there\nAre those are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention except doing my therapy keeping up like\nA medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything he went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but [noise] um I Want to make a point here that one time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days of my practice that people were coming in the hiring me it was their our was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling at a construct a way that was going to help them\nResolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect\nI think that's different than or your gentleman that we're talking about a yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the ... the a and I understand the need to corporations figure out\nHow to buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that and the second or ... so stay on the line but to your response to acceptance and\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when or why we started to see that go I'll go back to the first part of your question or comment orange which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she had back in the day it was different [noise]\nUm as as we continue to monetize healthcare system from a business perspective I now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system right two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidate into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing in the healthcare system now health care systems aren't run by doctors any longer the run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenge that we have here is that we continue to see consolidation\nUsed to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system try to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that they're actually working together and working together because out as a result of the afford it\nThey're they're working together because out as a\nAs a result of the Affordable CARE Act insurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and the c._e._o.\nOr Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin I Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my responsibilities to my shareholder not to the patients that by my product and this is part of the challenge we have an healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so when we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market\nAnd they've gobbled up the market share and now they're going to a hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now every doctors in network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nIs it true at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\n[noise] All right uh the the the least that covers quite a bit if you think that you would like to add to that a large\nOil I can add to\nBring up the the second point a simultaneous I think there's something strange about a doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrator or most hospital administrator is have a bachelor's degree\nOr they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more and are smarter actually let these people run the entire\nLaw wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs out spills are even worse than a doctor price as a a [noise] and and the\nQuality we're coming up on a break here that doesn't move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause and do it after these messages\n\nUse credit card debt ruining your life\nNow you can have a large

get something else he and all of them that call I think I've ever met\nSaid dad who are in our towns and therefore they Rob Peter to pay ...\nAre you are you still be talking about the practice of taking money out of the Social Security trust fund which of course has been done for a wide variety of things and in fact a lot of people think that there is in fact an account some plays with all of that uh\nThat psycho withholding when in fact there's nothing there but in Iowa you so I'll I'll address that question with our guest the stepped in and said\nWell listen I mean yeah [laughter]\nDefinitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades\nUm to to look to move money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is really insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash and the coffers from a standpoint of\nWe we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways that barring against the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all a would be effective\nAnd back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all a would be effectively just a massive uh the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with a baby boomer generation where they are with a life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created to ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retired shaving [laughter]\nRight and so but we distorted that in a way that now because of the advancements of modern medicine what you're good we're outliving the system or at least the system the way it was set up

or debts that area you know all this stuff and now ... now there's places will hired officials to specialize\nOr they say that you know she wants family nurse practitioner that said the whole family is that a nurse practitioner anyway it's just a big mess the whole health care system just a mess\nOkay how about that that mess says\nWell I think ... to to ban I mean we're seeing the same thing where oftentimes again it is a lot of this is geographic it depends on the region and how many hospital systems are available obviously if you're in a more metropolitan area of the opportunities for more specialties are there\nThe challenge when you get into more rural areas again is that those hospitals have to generate revenues and they don't have enough money to isolate to to pay toward specialties but specifically when it comes to nurse practitioners and and I think that that nurse practitioners arguably one of the most valued\nOr resources in the healthcare system these people should be lifted up that should be valued that should be utilized more to engage\nThe consumer in a in a healthier lifestyle to really understand to educate the walk people through it [noise]\nAnd unfortunately they're not utilizing the way that they need to be utilized which is really to engage at a higher level\nInstead they're utilized almost to bridge the gap so that the physician\nCan go find those higher costs issues to to direct their attention so I think that what nurse practitioners that unfortunately become pigeon holed in our society is and you kind of like the gap fill to make sure that they can prescribe the antibiotic that their life has to do that and move on and so\nWhat's been experiencing with his wife is because of her specialty she limited and the resources that she

or face a heavy financial penalty now than\nI doubt very seriously the laws constitutional\nBut we'll see if in fact you buddy cares to push it far enough if it made it to the Supreme Court I suspect it would be tossed out of out of out of bounds of course\nPutting a woman on the board of directors is not the same thing as the the the standard hiring process and in particular we're talking about

you might call the uh Billy Graham mentality of\nA man being cautious and their interactions with women like Mike Pence was accused of that a while back of being so cautious or not at all and I have lunch together or right and they are together that sort of thing\nWithout his wife a president yeah so that's\nWhat I heard of that act that way I see a great deal of wisdom of that on on a very distinct ... one of the second well let me start with the ... what if you will is that just to avoid that possibility of an\nUnfounded accusations it's just me and her and the car and say what's ever fuel arts and\nI'm guilty by by default in the same as as a cap it off I don't doubt so painfully and at least a week but the number one reason that is that just to avoid a possibility avoid the temptation of a situation I\nYou know you hear stories of guys have gotten in trouble a girl with a hotel room and just always while I don't know how we got there we didn't intend at we were just on a business trip and we just had dinner and but just for a walk to a room separately and we just ended up together\nBy what advice that kind of situation just avoid the very first step down the slippery slope and don't have that are together don't have the business trip together with the odd situation out right yeah\nBut of course if you do that you have affected Lee eliminated women from a a let's say positions such as the executive assistant you can't be an executive assistant to a a corporate president without doing just that the ... you wouldn't even be effective and the role you've got to work closely with them\nSo right off the air that you're taking a category of work which is an entry level to upper management for many people and you're essentially saying no women there I mean that that is what we're talking about\nThis and in that sense it is a an unfortunate unintended on her side effect of all me too movement is that guy is just have to be cautious\nThis type of situation

Steve welcome\nHey Mr votes um [noise] but ... says because it it is not going to sound politically correct but I think what has happened is that confusion between a\nSexual harassment attempted rape or whatever I'm\nGoing to be in the black side my words in our number ... good here but uh with just the evening relationship between a male and um\nI ... if I had\nA new girl and going back to la

okay well then then that it would be the end of\nThe guys further work that they are for nation\nA forceful harassment ball spoke a temp take like well\nI mean of course it would depend on the exact specific suffice it to say going forward would lay you open to any number of possible charges are the best rule of thumb is always no means no that's certainly true and I'm not sure that uh that everybody in this country grew up with that with that viewpoint but that obviously is the lesson for today\n[noise] yes I agree with you all of that but I'm just talking the reality\nThat you've got young kids out there in poverty situations that sort of thing\nA certain things happen\nLike that goes so far and if the person uh does not wall that shut off I say this and if the other person ... pursuing it to\nEnd the ... the law\nExactly and I think that everybody pretty much agrees that that's that's the case yeah\nBut you can't come back ... years and years later and it's like a put his

you said she said no I mean did you say you know if you were moving forward at an already put your hand on her but she had\nSaid no yet in a ... that's not a\nA sexual assault as far as I'm concerned until she says no it is consensual I Would say by definition\nWomen have got to speak up and if they don't then they can't make a case not once they do the Mets the line but I mean\nYou just said

show Dr Sebastian Gorka is our guest\nIs the Fox news national security strategist one of America's most trusted authorities on national security strategy and counter terrorism\nA former deputy assistant to the president gives electric for us special operations command the FBI counter terrorism division and the Green Berets he is briefed among others the CIA the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number Dr Gorka you\nTake note of the idea that there are two spectrums of any allergy objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that while that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject to truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling your call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nThe truth when talking about the test Monday from Dr fold so telling the truth\nIs no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is all you get this is posed motives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics that would be divided into two groups those who believe there is one shows\nAnd those that believe everything is relative to those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they're out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction\nBut what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there's there's right\n... they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is the the two of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the liberals are spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nIt depends I mean the the theory that the theology and then there's the ... so the question is what what is the practice or if if it's a Muslim who's living in America a band or behaving in a ...\nMuslim who's living in America a band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as ... or elsewhere\nWhere it ... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of whom are such as I gather style than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so you know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talk to you about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left uh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go or do you think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] yeah it's a very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming Mitt to lose\nAll the all the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nIs incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years\nMore than a hundred million people were killed in the may was socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat body I've managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations advocated control\nOf the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and in a very anti American ideology you are or less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that\nBut in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor isn't presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more we\nAbdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today but if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the educational system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n[noise] hell of a chance that hey you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject of chit chat with a\n... that is a this claim that there is such that as such we both repudiate the idea but go ahead well\nThat still just an opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical or no matter how uh how much feeling it but in Chile which has followed A L a difference between the two ... tailings and logic\nBut that ... that that that might be a big difference\nAnd it's just oh shit show we feel the getting rid of subjective jak stuffed shirts and yellow and school and the first place", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "16"}
