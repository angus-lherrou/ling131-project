here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us at eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you know mandatory in crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops has caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has even immigration\nLaws I think even the immigration laws are are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws are needed to be modernized an updated [noise] ah what this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants\nSure so what should the United states do it for seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand fortunately the United states feel about this\nThis is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a a caravan of people's unarmed come into this country so let them as well I I'm saying to process improperly real quick unable to is there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet she gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening and it gets turning the talking points that interests you\nKnow treating I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly if it is treated such as that way so I I think the ... we need a human being having here have and needs to be a real solution um does fall for it [noise] um in in feeling\nWith who are both of after his the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens for a discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends are sworn in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim what's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this sort of invasive behaviors gone it on every day it I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is the type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis plays badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying well just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political\nAnd all this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would

Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is Texas and the places we normally think about\nUm it's manageable or at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with it\nManageable or at least the government was smart enough to inundate the border with agents are where we had controlled and better but now with these hordes coming as it's getting back out of control\nWhat would you do have a good yeah well here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um\n[noise] he could the president could send the military down which is a smart move however listen these people are coming\nIt seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp uh we had the greatest military honor of we can set it up no time set up with\nCans and with many holes in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need and therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so we're right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big\nAirport so you need to do it by the even the air stationery over in Sierra Vista a default would chew cuts and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you do is to these people are overly claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff that ... and what they do is they may um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they what they should set up these um I'm I'm a camp and then have to go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there and\nSent down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so the Dems can't complain and then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states\nAnd if they go through this then we could do what's called the jeep pat light which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd hold on I'm In agreement with that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's\nOrganizing this and it's going to be bigger I don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you I mean a lot ... who's in charge and they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian he\nCouldn't failure and I tell you right slump we're talking to those countries in saying that we're going to look cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be Mexico and writes the cut them off to if they can't control it and they've got the military that they can control and then we can control\nBut well put thank you uh look that's an humanitarian idea that the fly in the ointment is I don't think it's acceptable and who's in charge well so far it legal immigration has been in charge the ball is in President Trump's court let's go to Gary in Williamsport, Pennsylvania hey Gary welcome in\nLeaving high name [laughter] I Am looking at the issue from this perspective they might have had horrible these people have probably had horrible humanitarian conditions where they're coming from

name is down here down over eight six six fifty Jim ... is this ... from a great guy you know there's plenty of room for him in the Republican Party or independent if Democrats don't want 'em imagined being kicked out around that\nBut we're seeing tonight a couple of things I wanted to ask you were seeing in Texas and I'm hoping that we can hear from somebody maybe in the Houston area they're traveling back it listed on the radio the buying and show eight six six fifty jumbo that was that the Trump rally cruise rally the tailgate\nThat the guesstimate is it could be eighty two hundred thousand people at some point today were on those grounds are around them this truly was epic just amazing even for taxes eight six six fifty jumbo\nAnd if you've been to a Trump rally\nWhat is the magic of it when you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're\nWaiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for that number of hours or have or have waited for four or five hours or more eight six six fifty jumbo get you on board now\nI didn't have a chance I wasn't on the gym I did it on my own show in\nThough the opposition to this is just enraged tonight on several levels Kevin McCarthy he's the house majority leader you see this guy prematurely grey nice looking guy California\nWell his office was vandalized a Boulder is the report ... a large Boulder these guys picked up a Boulder not just a brick and threw it through the window and took off they have it up what his Instagram account\nThrowing a Boulder holding a Boulder up between the two of them and throwing it through a window of Boulder attack\nAnd here's the thing who are the most divisive celebrities in America a focus group last week there this morning console that's called and they took celebrities entertainers people like me talk show host in alike\nAnd the criteria was that there was the most polarity between Democrats\nAnd Republicans with these two in other words Democrats favor Republicans were opposed or the opposite got it so Hannity was in second place Russia was in third\nWhat do you think was number one\nAnd I'm going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for it not shocked you think of Alan\nNice not limited seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum everybody's so nice there is no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that the top producer out a multitude of producers of the Ellen DeGeneres show tonight showed his hand and I think this is what the degenerate show was about\nHe attacked millennia Trump I mean look you can attack president ... how do you tackle millennia Trump\nThe executive producer Andy lashing her took to Twitter\nTo insult Mrs Trump\nTook to Twitter to insult Mrs Trump and to praise the care of and he said\nI'm way more afraid of another millennia getting into this country than I Am of any of the caravan of human beings seeking asylum is what he wrote and I maintain this is exactly the mentality of the people around these shows even as something that seems to be as offensive\nAs the Alan ... number for the most divisive about Republicans and Democrats say who's the number one most divisive figure out there and it needs to Russia's three you get that polarity you know they're provocative chores\nBut this guy the executive producer of the Ellen DeGeneres show tipping they're anti air millennia is a bigger threat than this human caravan coming our way can you imagine\nEight six six fifty gym about eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six let's get some callers in right now Don in Albany\nOregon is an actor and get everything done high\nThere and get myself I'm just I just have one question for your are communist socialist their own worst enemies more often than not\nA in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new idea and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah [noise] but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we cut and we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the light to them done that they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for summer wedding those student loan debt every time I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey\nCory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's a way to make things more equitable fifty grand by that a hundred grand I don't know that fifties enough\nAnd I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGone after student loan debt well here's the thing who's charging all this the people that run colleges are progressive Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging it every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government et cetera then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up figure they're charging whatever they can get away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive set a running it All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out there and show and if you've ever been to a Trump rally and I'm really hoping to get somebody I think we might have a couple of coming up\nHere on the ... and John I Want to get a full time if you went to this rally tonight or all day long\nThis was

wave here it's not going to happen in the Senate Republicans are going to pick up three or four Senate seats\nOn top of what they already have the house that's where the battle is that's going to be tough it's going to be very very close not a blue wave but\nAs a caravan bears down on us as we see people throwing boulders ... windows harassing Mitch McConnell as he ate at what looked to be like

seeing this other mob headed toward the border the invasion the caravan and which side do you think Americans are going to side with even though like Dave or quite quite said if he doesn't like Donald Trump the way he presents at times and all that\nThat's protecting America even a flawed versus the other side just on the attack significant numbers are going to go with the Trump agenda side that's the way it's going to work\nAnd this caravan is exactly that coming up soon it take a moment to put something on your radar screen\nAnd I bet a lot of people listening have not heard this but when you

a big piece center but that's the only national media the rest of the national media said we're not going to cover her could it be because Murphy is a far progressive\nAnd that's why they won't cover

little bit of your play by play on at the big Trump rally now Katie branding\nIs a woman who were deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal running for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez about a hundred and forty thousand dollar jobs the housing czar in the Murphy administration after he won drove her home\nUh you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked you use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend a joiner she shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to their Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to her as a mate with her at least the governor\nDid and then they never do here's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't it be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a foreign they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now\nLegislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it but why should a national median\nJudge is being brought in to investigate it but why should a national media not interested in this even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with resources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believer Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job and despite all these complaints they gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say\nThe point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie brand name\nIn any way that you can spread that around ... people you see the wall Street Journal piece\nAbout it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard of what actually goes on so the standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media he shouldn't be on the court\nIf a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow did this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there and gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's what they come up with a coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be\nThat when Governor Christie was governor we had bridge gate and there was tremendous national media and I think it was a serious thing what he did there\nOr his staff at least it with the George Washington bridge and the traffic and the whole thing on three days but this is the story rip right from the

this graphically what's been going on day after day\nBut I Want to play you I got a whole bunch of things this hour to catch up on I Want to play you this goes back and I've never been able to get this guy and I've tried mightily I'm a Catholic but guys like this they just sickened me he's the bishop of Tucson why Zimmer\nWeisberg and um this was during the period of time of the migrant children and allegedly their mom somewhere their mom some we're not you know that whole thing how emotional it was over the summer this guy was at a con fab\nOf bishops in arch bishops and cardinals with all the pre scandal problems he brings up because he speaks in a roundabout way but it's clear what he's saying as a Catholic the worst thing that can do to you is actually communicate you you are kicked out\nAnd the methodology of actually mean occasion is saying you've seen so grievous leaders told your very soul is at risk\nOf going to hell\nThis guy gets up before the bishops and says these border patrol people in the administration not just on the border everybody associated with this that's doing this Trump policy we should consider X. communicating them\nSo that they realize they're risking their soul for this guy and his policies\nAnd thinking how dare you\nIs this guy ever speak out about Democrats who masquerade as Catholics on the life issue did we hear him on that so I Want to play that for you analyst or a minus out diligent people are\nSent me detailed reports in the Roman Catholic Catholic isn't about immigration and it doesn't match what this guy saying it says that country has a right to protect itself\nThe caravan coming our way a lot of young men and their verses women and children and that's one thing to take a look at by the way well this is going on with the midterms coming to your calls in just a second\nHere's an example of how wild it's getting with Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans want you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe pre existing condition argument again\nNow I've had on people that have explained I think fully that's not the Republican position at all so there is a major house race right where I Am in the Philadelphia area it's in a place called Bucks County\nBrian Fitzpatrick is the Republican Scott while I was a very wealthy guy a grandson I guess it is a great great grandson of a um\nA guy who was the vice president of the United states under FDR until he got kicked out because of how far left he was wow it's just very far left so he's been prosecuting this campaign saying that Brian Fitzpatrick and this is a key very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives\nIs a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all that is the Washington Post writes a piece saying that's a lie\nAnd ... should stop saying Brian Fitzpatrick brings it up there were holding a debate on Sunday night in a synagogue now as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal the Scott while I was wanted to their Scott Wallace is seen as the guy who's anti Israel and that is true the Democrat\nIn the middle of this Wallace can't take it anymore that pitch Patrick is using this a Washington Post story to rebut this why\nAnd he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the beam ma if you're Jewish synagogues being by an elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the\nTemple and\nThen he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate about this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had the sound the sound was on a well this is what ... wanted in place but a TV station may have gotten it but\nJust think about this and this is the classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is the health care and say when even a Washington Post says the Republican did not do that would not do that its ally wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know this is a sacred spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is he just never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nSitting here listening to it and she had that kind of a tech guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWhat it said hey hocking and if I get to stay on next time I Want to play it you got to stand a Katie this guy is worth of the family was worth three hundred million a silver spoon he just came in and trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during a debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred grounds of the temple\nExactly I mean in my opinion and it's just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with God\nYeah one of them see [laughter] yeah [laughter] exactly right but it's hard to believe thank you Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side where this is going it's David in Greenwich New Jersey hello David\nI'm In my car you want to point a to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there\nAnd not only I mean we're liking to that too like the altar and the Catholic Church but yet only did he drop it there but he's telling me you should've heard him outside when he was leaving there is a shame thing this crew coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times ... dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico stand you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned that I'm bothered that depress you see these folks walking ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nRight well what we've seen radio to Roger point we've seen video of people ended up money given that supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish a Univision reporter the translation embedded to your point with the caravan says he meant migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up\nOr is hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh and up and this sort of a re\n[noise] ah because you can walk into any

migrants from known terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what are they doing there\nThis is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing a rally that is it's gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and a pact or basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox in France today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty gym about\nTheir believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as humanitarian crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that the United states has hunting even immigration\nLaws [noise] I I think an even immigration laws are are are a problem for any country [noise] and I think our immigration laws on you to be modernized and updated or what this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants sure\nSo what should the United states do is so seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand fortunately the United states do about this for this is the\n... country on the planet I think we can handle a a a caravan of people's unarmed come into this country so let them and I'm well I'm saying to process improperly real quick on neighborhoods there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet she gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning their talking points that are as you\nKnow reading I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly infant is treated such as that way so I I think the ... we need a human being some here have and needs to be a real solution um does fall for his um in in feeling\nWith who are both of after up his men terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens discussion\nAlright that's from Fox and friends as one in my audience was outrage after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this we have up words as he said it could be twenty thousand I'm seeing various caravans various things come together\nJust they they're going to punch through Mexico what appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of his this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass\nBut this sort of invasive behavior has gone on every day it I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is a type of thing that goes on and I think this\nPlace badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let 'em in is that disillusioned now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church and as\nA military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong we do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this is not just political\nAnd all of this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you and and if you have a reaction to us the ban and that was really good stuff that you're the man of

say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media are thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff it is they won't feel good as Americans if Trump\nStops this I think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it he loses faith\nIn the base that people are saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this and we don't

the overwhelming story that has legs moving right to the mid term it kind of summarizes all these things that are out there around illegal immigration America First and all that\nSo let's go to somebody who lives near this uh let's see bill is in southern Arizona near the border hey bill welcome in\nHey how's it going tonight I'm\nVery very good you know I I went to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is taxes and the places we normally think about\nUm it's manageable a at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we are in control in a better but now with these hordes coming as it's getting back out of control\nHas a\nGood yeah well here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um\nHe could the president you could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming\nAnd it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was to set up a massive refugee camps that we have the greatest military honor as we can set it up in no time set up with\nCans and with holes in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need and therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you couldn't even do it by the even the\nAir station [noise] over in Sierra Vista at the Fort would chew gum and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you're doing this to these people are overly claim some refugee status or some asylum status and stuff that ... and what they do is they may um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should set up these um um\nUm I could you camp and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there and\nSent down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain and then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like\nThey're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states and if they go through this then we could do what's called the jeep pet flight which is a repatriation flight to their country and\nHold on I'm In agreement with that he had a problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because there's well by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them toward these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you know what you who's in charge and they are we are\nWell look so you're right is humanitarian you\nCouldn't failure and I tell you right slump we're talking to those countries in saying that we're gonna we'll cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be in Mexico and writes the cut them off to if they can't control it and they've got the military that they can control and we can control\nBut well put thank you uh look that Senate humanitarian idea the the fly in the ointment is I don't think it's acceptable and who's in charge well so far to legal immigration has been in charge the ball is in President Trump's court let's go to Gary in Williamsport, Pennsylvania hey Gary welcome in\nThe evening Hi name [laughter] I Am looking at the issue from this perspective they might have had horrible these people have probably had horrible humanitarian conditions where they're coming from [laughter] that I have great empathy for that\nBut I also feel that I Am a beleaguered taxpayer at if all of these people start entering the country\nHere I'm having trouble keeping myself or my way going economically that are going to need more tax money sure just with my pockets are
