on their territory [noise] oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article uh that we probably don't need necessarily to develop a tit for tat\nAh there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange weapons could include an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up with violating type cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do is\nMy preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good and it's all the systems but they're not perfect by any means [noise] uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack and that certainly is not good enough so we want to do I think\nIs to offset the Russians are doing here but a lot more money and a lot more time to perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided dies Star Wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense that is in Middle East

of time before we will be able to as the old expression went shoot down a bullet with another bullet that this is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes [noise]\nWell and you're right but we've already done I mean the question is how to get a better way we have systems right now are a strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska are capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight [noise]\nUh we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system or we have batteries are in\nSouth Korea I Know we have and that other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nOr you know the systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and

thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask ... about a Pittsburgh John ... similar cancer may seem to have an industry is feeling the medical and scientific cetera um\nAnd it's doing well the reason is doing well however the city schools the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending their students to the ... public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is the Oklahoma City outlet schools are they doing through the transformation of the economy in your city\nIt's it's a little inconsistent certainly we're we're a little different and that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits\nFor and that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City and so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four [noise]\nBut the largest district as about forty percent of the population that the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo that means the urban public school setting it's still it very much a stressful situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools are out all around you know that center part of the city\nAnd people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... issue that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and and other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density and the core of the city but I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they been\n[noise] well most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are ... now I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like my one of my granddaughters that chance that a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders are who you know kind of\nInsurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about about the model\nIt's not that they have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district\nOr but they've taken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know and and that one instance of things to be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices\nUm and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices yeah\nI I Know of course the your acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the opening of the new stadium for the Oklahoma City red archer AAA a baseball team sports franchises a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become disgusted with the exorbitant demands from most sports franchise owners [noise]\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is fear\nFear if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level up a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean as much but it does and the fact that\nIt suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it\nAnd that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent is who your sports teams play and there's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team as an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job on on a millennial basis ... my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture and a major league sports team mates you culturally relevant when well so west broke and Paul George to name a couple of our players\nYou know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts air when they're offered contract by every other team in the league seemingly um at that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nA ... I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nWhile we're coming up on a break here that that does that move here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be right back\n\nDoes your basement or crawl space to have a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation\nAnd that could mean increased mold growth and build up of harmful toxins gases don't bother with a D humidifier he'd just circulates the same unhealthy air now\nThere's a better way to remove these dangers and odors it's with a computerized way ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants with wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they constantly pennies a day to run\nWave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package that includes the wave ventilation unit plus a sixth stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available\nImmigrants reading number went by employees in the U.S try now for free at different ... dot com slash free net different crew dot com slash free zip recruiting smartest way to hire the reading of hiring tightened up or what has ...\nWhen the need for senior characterizes there's no place like home\n... never had to give up living at home visiting ... who provide home care for your mom and dad at home a twenty four hours per day including personal care meals and light how smart you can get professional ... visiting in you know look at things getting into dot com or car\nEight seven seven three seven ... seven three seven four man franchises or an animal leaving a you know America's Choice in senior home care\nYesterday I got a call from the IRS me saying I owe them over sixteen thousand dollars I don't have that kind of money I didn't notice that if I don't pay them in thirty days you're going to go into my bank account and take my money put a read on my house and tarnished by wages can they really do that\nThe IRS can do all that and more unless you did help do try to fight the IRS in your own call us ... let them help you get a price start\nMay have access to the Iraqis priced start initiative which can stop collective effort and help you reduce your back taxes by as much to eighty percent so you'll get a fresh start\nIf you oh at least ten thousand dollars in back taxes call now for free and confidential tact than our parents call us ... now and eight hundred eight or nine by by ... to learn if you qualify\nCall eight hundred eight or nine five five three and eight hundred eight or nine five five three again eight hundred eight on die by by Perri\n[noise] Mm [noise]\n\n\nYou're\nWith us on the ... six six\nFive oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six years we talk tonight with a man who was\nQuite familiar with the problems in urban America he was a\nFour terms the mayor of Oklahoma City and he's the author of the next ... American city when you speak of the the next American city uh how how next is that is it's like a five years or ten years down the road or is this the city of popping up right now for\nOil cities are never reached their journey there at least the end of their journey there always evolving\nAnd what we're talking about is starting to purposely create inner cities in urban corridors where young people could lamb and I\nCame to the environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities and still you know look at the quality of life and the cost of living\nUm and amenities appeal to that generation\nAnd it you know it's hard to generalize 'cause every city stiffer\nBut almost every city out there in the category we're talking about some sort of urban revitalization taking place and young people are attracted to that there's an urbanization going on all over the world and midsize metros are capitalizing right now and for the procedure future\n[noise] twenty six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in the Ozark, Missouri small town about that far from a a a somewhat smaller midsize cities Springfield than the good evening Brian\nFine thank you for your guest sure you have earthquakes a black hole [noise] I think\nIt's played a role yeah\nMy question is given knows we're at a minor earthquakes in Branson\nHere uh Springfield oil is our new lacquered fall there is no but we're here but we have the president's ... short\n... quake or maybe the ... fault around or\nI don't think that they needed ... votes or impact it which is by the way based in southeastern Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\nAre your thoughts Mr Mayor\nWell like I said I think he's just as I say there's a connection to try and do well and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like that there is a connection there so you know central Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these nerve ing earthquakes but I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry\nIt's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we've been burned and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas if they'd like to bring out without causing harm on all the rest of this\n[noise] now in the Oklahoma economy of course a began a pretty much watch uh uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered it of course the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven [noise]\nUh the the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the state's economy still that directly tied to do energy or has it didn't affect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversified but the ... and so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas string\nAnd as a result it it's a it's caught on me and it's tax revenues cyclical based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been making that made them more efficient industry uh you know with the current price which is quite slower than it was just a few years ago they were able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract the oil and gas on the ground it's or technology driven and they get more oil and gas out of a single well used to [noise] um and so the result of that as a more efficient business model\nWell it used to [noise] um and so the result of that as a as a business model or one day they'll play ... fewer people but that has really helped me get guided stage determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I like the oil and gas industries you know it's there's been a wonderful job and and creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on uh the sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which as an income tax even what what is the basis for Oklahoma City taxes [noise]\nWell most of our operations comes from a sales tax and most of our capital of age come from property tax\nThe or the maps program is a little bit outside of the scenario I just described as it is for capital projects as well but in general it's all
