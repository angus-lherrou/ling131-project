show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim bode talks and as I\nLook out on this great national crazy quilt of public discussion these days with all of its animosity like it's hard not to notice the glitter because goodness knows we are a celebrity obsessed society\nAnd celebrities have an outsized into very disproportionate influence on the national discussion to reason examples jumped out of me there have been many over the years certainly a\nA recall the the big discussion that President Trump had with Meryl Streep some years ago uh not ever face to face fortunately or it could have gotten\nA very confrontational but I Know the two recent examples of a pop stars who have become part of the national discussion Kanye West coming out end up strongly backing President Trump\nAnd before that\nIt's not that long ago a Taylor Swift recovery is our [noise] who up came out regarding the uh the tennis it did as a Senate race that what she of course as a a\nWho came out regarding the uh\nThe tendency you did as a Senate race that what she of course is a a native of that state and her opposition to Republican Marsha Blackburn over Democrats feel president [noise] and I looked at those first of all I Will give due credit to each there's no question about the fact\nThat the both of these people express\nTheir opinions as Americans for which they have every right so to do and uh probably did so at some jeopardy into their own careers are certainly a with a\nA a a fan base and as a predominantly African American Kanye West has not gain any support or a new listeners by virtue of supporting President Trump says\nHe's a he's probably suffered some economically Taylor Swift of course in the country genre wondering only look back to the Dixie Chicks remember them [noise]\nAnd ah I doubt that Taylor Swift will receive any a career benefit from her statement so I grabbed courage to both of them they spoke their minds even if it may have angered me the base of their uh popular support\nBut that's as far as I think it should go\nAt heart of course in such statements by each is the notion that we should somehow listen more to people who are essentially well known because of their well known ness [noise]\nTo find the best senior living communities across the country and free service that number to call a\nPlace for mom at one eight hundred for six seven

sure I trust their motives\nI mean ... there's not primarily country anymore she had been primarily up and that the question I get it that ... top probably more to the left and right there with a different story with Dixie Chicks I gave them credit because they were primarily country\nAnd they did actually they suck up the other day that that's a big yeah I'm not sure I trust Kanye West's motives either\nI'll have to wait and see if\nI'd have to wait and see anything happen and there's all this support [noise] I'll I'll just have to wait and see\nI see what you're saying and ... and

well enough to know now that no the the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy a compliment if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so do I I think it is you use really of Andrew

jumbo or doing five well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country running drone all the time about your age maybe a little over but\nPeople don't have a critically saying let somebody else to sink in for him and the one thing I heard the U.S or on the Internet today are sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA because the layout burst and they wait inducted himself his performance in the hearings where you know he knows Carter been there a court room at the Capitol\nFinancial decisions he made I really do one thing you see what I mean\nThe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges have been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote\nAn apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise] yeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter the category of\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just say hey listen show all the time on my way home from work and my car I actually calling you from my car that I think a west and that's how they slashed AL and I'm an independent\nAnd I am not a Republican and I am an end and and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point if they have millions of followers\nAnd they kept quiet here let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how much I just think that they just again just half a million followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrities says that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out oh without question without quest are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your show a lot and again I think that I think I guess trying to reach all their followers and it's just trying to get the vote out there now\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them probably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ... a boy when you take a hit you in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard in Durham North Carolina\nNow Hi hey Jim how you doing I'm well thank you\nI'm

when they get to a certain point of saying it is their thing\nTo get into politics that's one thing or they are actually active in politics when you have so many years today that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they add allies each table and if they believe that\nTheir idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing what the consequences are still that that's the wrong way to use your say\nYeah I I again uh I I think what they have to say and how they say it's both both does a couch a very much uh so I see what you're saying it and that would be

bit about it and just for we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross cough a metro scarf uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states on flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season it's going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it's going to be\nExactly and for those who say well I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty third team there is something they need to realize and that is a a flu viruses are very sneaky thing that keeps changing honest\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasoned as we move from one season and to the next to vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we are going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year [noise]\nLet's look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nHe has so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand that\nUm we had one hundred and eighty recorded so far a pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um\nThe activity was very sustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did\nEffected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um all of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have debts and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young\nAdults can get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this here on the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nBecause most of us are not at all confident to make that choice ah [noise] ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm One of the\nMany things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nFor the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what that means they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against fluid is the blood every year we were told you sure do always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flu and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu antiviral medicines take those medicines\n\nRed Sox won another world series Boston down the Dodgers five one in Los Angeles to complete a five game world series win over the Dodgers ...

George Soros\nAnything again you know that ...\nThat I agree with you hear a fake trials and you know he had these rallies take a lot I hear a lot of ...\nUh I don't know like throughout the rest is history to hear a sport it is they only had early elections\nThere's been no civility here and there was no way before we start that this is going on\nIn even scarier than news throws a ... ... email us ... if not all that and easy to Haiti or is it\nA car down or fall off the interest if anybody else out throughout the early ... there are always voted places that I tell you it it's pretty nasty there\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are sort of you are you're talking about an actual polling place is that right\nHere you know you've got one side on one side and the other side and then the other side and you know ... at the other\nAnd talking about people who are effectively although at a rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning with so many feet of a bowling side\nIt's like a hundred feet that thought what was happening if it wasn't as it was it's only three mean at the other people that day or I guess\nThat it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there in some cases party for at one another so even when they heard the falling on\nIt I think kids hey there and it'd be interesting is what happened and why is that the Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was Harris\nYeah well again I I'm\nA ... in other words you have in in the in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh the office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot\nBut I I don't think a lot of places that you actually have\nHave a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mail box if you sit in an absentee ballot or or or protest in the offices of let's say a a cow the a\nOf a county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well what they call it in the early ... anything that both his early ... gets\nBad after a certain state they have to go to David Crane thing just out of course you can see the apple two thousand but he is I Would say that one\nThe story broke get by with they're not doing that that is the the assets that ... I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't that I feel like a fall out later that after that it occurred\nOf data that same on really ever not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering do you have anything to ah to say in regard to the specific topic of the arrest of the suspect in the uh the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is at this stage\nThe Clinton Wyoming today at black people in this state it's fantastic ongoing arrest record in healthy people that it's in a restaurant for twenty five thirty than out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it replaces me as well of course\n[noise] uh yes it ... me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times\nAnd convictions or or what would matter in terms of uh of any of what amounts to prior restraint but I see what you're saying and yes obviously something needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur Oleg ... calls in from Philadelphia tonight they're good evening\n[noise] yeah and what's on your mind to hire so I'm fine I'm I\nWas I got up on what you're saying where I have a lot and you know or something like that so many chances I was also looking at it from that angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system around the country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think the field of mental health\nIt's even more under served radicals that are all and so maybe after somebody goes that and some times yeah they bought the offer of Asian but people are oh\nMaybe they could have a thing where they put people on mental probation where they they are a specialized health professional\nAnd health and maybe if\nI got I think what's more acceptable at first place that person would never get to that place in our minds they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money the professionals are expensive that's part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI investigation that the financial part of it on the other side\nAs a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent things from happening in the first place\nThat's just priceless especially after yeah especially somebody could be better building bombs and they\nI Would I say get lucky they\nAlso go undetected something actually happens and people get hurt as for something like that with a little bit of and that's something I see is priceless\nWell somebody that I Would agree that certainly to the extent that in fact we are able to be so proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health to the science down to ... to such that we can offer treatment of give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect your brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of mental health and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo having show on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so what's your columns things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah tell me that there is about as a as believable as the ... this thing that has been and why did they set up for this guy from day one\nThe whole thing is that is to try to ah bring Cynthia and support for the for the Democrats older really hold there was one of the targets I could have latest ... six years ago\nThat sets it so much BS unbelievable\nWhat I Want to hold her was granted he tended to pick a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure why when you say a set up I mean it sounds like the guy said at\nJim Jim this okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's what I thought\nOh my goodness oh lord that the CIA who did that\nYou're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are say look\nI Will not put it past that I Will not I would not\nWell okay so it's a lot of you know that at all it's the case of you know I asked bill\nBut I I like it I Believe at this point it is so phoney and it's so unbelievable that that are like why don't we just put a like a ... he asked me a thing on the outside say bomb inside it was so unbelievable from the start that this whole thing and it just\nIrrational buys this maybe they would have made it more believable for you either do more to come one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nThis big five or

devices which were delivered this past week to CNN two former presidents and others\nFBI Director Chris Wray of course has announced that arrest in the case then the other suspect as we know is fifty six year old Caesar say are the rest of the Florida and charged with five different federal crimes that could add up to forty eight years in prison\nRe made it clear that the devices in the packages were real and dangerous\nThirteen IDs for Santa various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clocks a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy reaction to heat shock or friction\nNow we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRe also awards that there could still be other such packages out there and there does anyone want information to contact the FBI again as we know disease are say art has told investigators that\nThe uh of devices would not have heard anyone and that he did not wish to hurt anyone whether or not he had anything else to say about why he went to all this trouble to do this is not clear a lead in Champaign, Illinois joins us on the jumbo had a Joe Linda good evening\nAnd and I could say a lot of things and I I cried when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and look at it for a while I'll think about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into place but I I'm just gonna ask pose that question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look and see pictures of him at Trump rallies number one ... what are they like photo shop\nMember and number two and a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County\nAnd they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the pace of people even if you want sticker on a vehicle you're going to get ... you're going to have your your vehicle attack scratched whatever it's going to be\nAnd these people are going to go after it and that Dana let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing with that in ...\nAnd so I'm kind of interesting observation is out\nThere are pictures out there that the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that\nThat certainly this was the day and age when with bumper stickers are virtually any kind of a can can get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the interview the ... says you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big bucks to set off some people out there\nAnd then ... year old Broward County ... car is covered when and I'm kind of stuff and all kinds of stuff and it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious thing about it that way you look at it so I just thought that I just think about those things\nWell I think those reports certainly to do worse the worth considering Lyndon I thank you for sharing that with us tonight when eight six six five oh jumbo Standley in Raleigh North Carolina Good evening Stanley\n... thank you for taking my call why your question I have no doubt that a ... up to date on this story as you are do I read as much from the secret service reports yeah we are records as you've been available\nSeveral times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs a nowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of it on a fair so where where did you claim that Trump\nI get that from the all the various arrests that were made this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or\nOther brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a of the preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people have been arrested who has a criminal histories pay their bills are that are able\nTo share them so they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about able to manage his own affairs without interfering with others let's put it that way\nOkay All right well that makes it clear I Do appreciate your time is a great show\nOkay All right with that that makes it clear I Do appreciate your time is a great show as usual much\nThanks very much that we appreciate that one eight six six five oh jumbo at age six six five oh five four six to six ah Scott calls them from Utica New York Good evening Scott\n... um I just wanted to say real quick I Try to China and um you know first of all the Democrats and Republicans um there's you know saying you know there's no way around and I think that that uh uh more or less true um\nAnd uh you know I think that that guy for like ... people back into history to fish and a lot of different aspects of Mark Dayton the chat line or that and the kids from Columbine and Charles in ... school shooters it seems an easier isolating people\nA very ... people that are are they in franchise\nWill know who they say that they call themselves disenfranchised there was nothing about this man was disenfranchise\nWell I I\nWhat I really mean is I think that what I was trying to say is they feel as though they're not ... Indian and anger and also a need to strike I mean this guy Adams and like a circus away get Liza rats do we haven't\nSet any sign that one other thing I just wanted to say really quickly I remember\nA like an arsonist that will set a fire and that is standing there and watch the chaos ensues also a\nLot of the problem too is every time you hear about someone while they more or less stayed under the age time that they that Iraq is getting toward the Y. or\nThey these criminals and they say well he's got a very long wrap sheet and you wonder why they're still running around and one more quick point is I may I remember watching the ... I Know this is gonna sound funny but\nI remember watching Batman and Batman was trying to figure out why in joker was doing what he was doing and how far in central woman his father Albert and censor\nThere are some people in this world that there is no rhyme or reason they just want to watch the world and Bertie\nShadi area you can't figure it out you know you just don't know what kinds of things people are sitting there by themselves and we went over the stress and anger that they come up wish to do\nOr is it that\nYou accept the fact that some people are out there I Do not accept the fact that we allow them to go beyond certain limits and to but I certainly agree with the central point Scott thank you very much we back with more in a moment\nIs by E R s St Louis yesterday here who are\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard came to\nThe baseball season is over the\nBoston Red Sox or World Series champions there five to one when at Los Angeles closes out the Dodgers and five games with this year's fall classic\nDodgers are now in record territory a record they don't want only one other team has lost to back to back World Series on home turf he was in Nineteen thirty six thirty seven New York giants at the polo grounds now you can add the twenty Seventeen and twenty Eighteen LA Dodgers to that\nAfter losing the Houston last year and now the Boston ABC's\nAlex Stone at Dodger Stadium in Indonesia a search and rescue effort is under way but there's been no word yet of survivors from the crash of lion air flight J.

earlier on the program but put it is not really a caravan of it is a mob additives that tried to invade the country\nWhere to gauge did a a great national argument that really hasn't changed that much I suppose over the years it is the whole question of whether we are in fact a sovereign nation whether in fact sovereign nations are a good idea [noise]\nAnd uh so goes the theory of those who feel otherwise that the sovereign nations equal hatred that nationalism automatically equals tribalism and I would counter that by noting\nThat there is no one world we do not all hold hands we do not all sing ... we did not have column heritage is or beliefs or ethics\nWe uh existed a world in which there are substantial numbers of people who believe that women should be property that buying and selling slaves is not that bad a deal\nThat uh if you leave a certain religious faith that I Am speaking about Islam that it is okay for had that they have that person but to death and that's a significant viewpoint and such relatively modern it Islamic countries as say Egypt for example\nWe do not all have one view of this world will we ever will ever is a long time a lot of the lifetime of just about anybody listening right now I'm not I suspect of the lifetime of anybody who was alive at this particular time\nThe idea here is not that nationalism is good or bad\nNationalism is the only alternative to anarchy\nThere is no world community or anything else that they're remotely smacks with some of the utopian nonsense that his pedaled out there as a plausible and possible policy options they they don't\nExist as policy options for better or for worse and I frankly feel that at this time in our world development of this for better we are a world of nation states\nAnd it is best to work within the framework of that which does work at which is accepted and are\nThere you have of the nation state as such exists to a great extent of based on its ability to define just where

you could take an asylum that we need to stop them before they enter our ...\nIf you do to stop it before they head or you can forget about it because uh they're they're God they've uh they've disappeared at that point so yes we do have to do that literally voice well taken given thank you for sharing Charlie and Manhattan, Kansas ... good evening Charlie\nCredited with you know\nI\nHad worked on your life denied Charlie\nFair share my grandfather came came to this country Nineteen or ... they came through Ellis Island yeah and you know we were up there I got the documentation of his ... and\nYou had to have money to get in the United states and if he didn't they set you back on the boat and if you are sick they set you back or what do these people coming up through the other way they they check but they're going to check their uh\nTheir physical danger or are they going to be sick or what\nWell they certainly need to be vetted at a variety of ways\nI mean they don't have any any right to come up here I mean we got this issue about him and to sign that says you know\nIt's true you're right thing to do by letting a man if you don't command you can get excommunicated from the Catholic Church that's absolutely ridiculous where the Catholic Church that at all these other problems and they got you got to finish up talking about this\nSo well that vision of the point of view and fifty cents as far as I'm concerned will get you a cup of coffee you have a parade would have to be by attitude to take his views of what is there is not right and the stick them so thanks

people came into the country the right way\nThrough Ellis Island you know through the right process [noise] I don't understand and I am a Marine Corps war veteran and I've been to some of these countries\nI don't understand why Mexico is not doing anything they're letting them come through that show and we deal with it and they don't have to\nThat's right but uh they're they're doing it because it's to their advantage and that's why they have always until now suddenly had a very tough southern border with Guatemala their northern border they've always looked upon as essentially a toilet to flush the era of employment and other problems on to the United states\nThe editor medical or absolutely and\nI I I'm forty nine years old I Am a war veteran and I voted for the first time for a president that slashed election and I am a Trump supporter and I believe what he has planned on putting our military on the line to stop them is absolutely correct I I I don't see how there's an argument for that\n[noise] oh uh there there's no no rational argument you'll get all kinds of people who get hot and bothered about the fact that we're not being generous enough so is that there's been for me to hear all the people out there who were so generous with the your dollars in my dollars\nTo feel morally superior so thank you for your service DJ and for your good thoughts David in
