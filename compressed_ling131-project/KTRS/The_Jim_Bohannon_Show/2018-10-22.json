national security strategist one of America's most trusted authorities on national security strategy and counter terrorism\nA former deputy assistant to the president here's lectured for us special

is defeating jihad the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of radiology objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend the wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling you call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrats said at the starting with Cory Booker to use the phrase\nThe truth when talking about that testimony from Dr fold so telling the truth\nIs no such thing as truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what you get this is posed motives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics to be divided into two groups and those who believe there is ...\nAnd those that believe everything is relative but those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\nWhat if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe do but how would a believer in subject the truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong with theirs is right\n... yeah that that may have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you can use against the the liberals spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam has a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's the theories as the theology and then there's the ... so the question is what what is the practice if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America a band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\nWhere it's all um become lose the legal system we're sure real law actually becomes the ... of the land ... than we have a problem because then the the truth is that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country than who we are actually talk about\nOne thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today\nHope you about one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left\nUh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go or do you think that they've overstretched overreached I should say it in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\nYes they're very good question I just uh the ... in the upcoming Mitt to lose\n... the ... the Democrat Party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a at a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of\nAmerican millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the may was socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party overall the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases or who have an absolute axe to grind and in a very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try and hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor of the presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I couldn't agree more we abdicated the schools the high schools the colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allow the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had an show with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\n[noise] hell of a chance okay and I said earlier that there is a subject of truth in that check check truth\nAs they say this claim that there is such that as such we both repudiated the idea but go ahead well\nThat still just an opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical or no matter how much feeling it put in to it which is probably a difference between the two is failing logic\nBut that that would generate a cell that that that might be a big difference\nAnd shit show he'll be getting rid of subject that Jackson was in school and the first place\nUniversal windows Durang is the home of the dream tiger being by ers St Louis\n\nOn ABC News\nI'm Richard cancer who\nMade it there are words of five thousand people in a caravan of Honduran migrants marching through Mexico intent on getting to the U.S\nSaid the department of homeland security secretary sensitive statement she is monitoring the caravan situation costs like adding quote we work with our partners in the region to investigate and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law also seek to encourage and profit from the regular migration\nThe government's up ... ... and Mexico say they're addressing the situation a\nB.

eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHad help from the United states government [noise]\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary at a lot of material left over because pat and\nWas an occupier in southern Germany before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from pat and and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we got to use these captured Nazis\nTo spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing hadn't had one actually fight them he wanted to fight style and so that's what the new CIA or that took over from the judge did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and gift shop all people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most of our human beings have it off the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose\nUh before the third Reich collapse of\nGermany was going to lose him with all he can negotiate except for peace is kind of crazy delusional stuff from him what he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they help these guys get outta Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland help them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to a general way Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa\nOr if it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out and we took him big guys and we took it Eichmann andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we prove that in the book by dental work so compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... the ... ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nDuring World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the ... go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they killed millions of people who just ordinary people\nAre just amazing I'm ... and when you read it if the people that couldn't happen yeah it it it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise in your eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand that the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two uh certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind\nOf justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican another's did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil [laughter] that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male\nTo go after Adolf Eichmann and they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that thing\nThat forced force Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear that we named the man that I have two men didn't sign the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge or an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't salad or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tidbit if you will of some orders for thought from his latest of the killing series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang busters ... just

Americans have picking that up\nPicking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragic ironic\nThat people are calling themselves at an anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean they called themselves anti fascist is just tragic ironic at and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them\nThe the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics or like the same same thing but in America a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nA lot of them do yeah yeah\nI'll take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes but all whereas on the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe the a and R guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect so I'm curious which do the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road live spontaneity\nWell you know probably the worst interview or in the world is if you eat in the world because on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they make so when it comes to a question like that Mike I answer is I prefer to vote because it does\nIf you're in the studio for months at so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of seeing the country she in the world that yet being able to get in there and and just create Kennedy of your with your friends in front of my microphone\nYou guys have anything that approaches oh a a bucket list that you've done so much and you have received these honors an

and well yeah a Armstrong his dad was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won\nOr lost to the moon and you're listening to the moon Armstrong did they have this little ... they weren't sure if the chosen to work that they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted the here just in case he got stranded up there for a year in the capsule
