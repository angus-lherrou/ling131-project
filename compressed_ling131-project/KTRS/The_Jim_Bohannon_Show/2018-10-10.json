O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the out of the calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live our fall\nHere he was spending that much experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried ... travel and most of the major the ways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith on a on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where much of south and North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou you need to make sure that when you're when you're going now they'll go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start undecided votes because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can shake undeclared major or a state and then a bed and then if that happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let let's see what the ethic overcast to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on a leisure early a track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you\nThat you should know at least several of the major rose to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nSo when you're doing it on a leash usually time why it's not a problem\nYou don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach we're going to go to through this direction\nTo that location so this way family members who you rely on\nThose even the people on the other side cannot get that same note meaning the text of the email message wants that to our charges on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that sour\nNo as a as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the your thoughts your or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nMakes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said and activate your GPS for your family members so\nThis way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in the times of weather related problems such as like all you know the storm skipped throw it down you know can take out\nProblems such as like all the stars get thrown down you know can take our technology and if the towers that evil that you're sending a signal to went down\n... single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get that message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly they receive those messages so as long as you're standing up saying no you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will be the that was a power it's connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens here and\nI Would just throw in a quick little plug for a radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you is in such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had a show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\n... that's a that's a very very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie [noise] um why not just [noise] I'm a [noise]\nA [noise] hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [noise] a wave of [noise]\nBut uh [noise] maybe a hydrogen bomb or well\nThat's a nuclear bomb too because you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter [noise] ah I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes by\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea there is too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way let's say the United states less to let's say you know in a state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store\nAnd the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable for ... for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and it goes straight through Mexico City and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nI Will I Will for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to be upset\nYeah and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody would ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action led to what followed but ah this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they didn't have the hurricane promptly took a sharp left during an added inland\nAnd the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly up\nFor them to just simply change of course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I Would think it'd be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd\nBetter learn to do it with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe and his book is emergency prepping
