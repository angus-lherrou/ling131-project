America at our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nAnd that that's a quite a title the jungle grows back go see a derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know what we've been living in all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world forces coming from China and Russia\nOr ... or is that you know want to sort of destroy the world it's creative and that's what I mean by the fact that we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us\n[noise] and of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a lot of our business\nNone of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arms fear will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat\nOur own shores and make our country better and we won't we will go meddling is somewhat but at\nThe shore and I mean it's very tempting because of course it's costly to get involved in the world but I think what we learn in a in the Nineteen thirties when we we tried to pursue exactly that policy we tried to stay out of the world is that ultimately the world comes back and bite sauce\nAnd then we have to fight a much bigger war and spent a lot more money and cost a lot more lives so we need to take the steps when it when it's still possible to do so at a reasonable cost\nAnd that means to be steadily involved\nNow another issue that often comes up an argument if you will of countering the one that you make in the book the jungle grows back is that\nTaken out of out from Afghanistan before they had an opportunity to attack us which assembled that weight faults at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I Know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I I still have a hard time believing you're better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nThat would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now add some people are without carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes as a country uh I certainly make mistakes\nUh ... what about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is\nA are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way men are unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we'd have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOne as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was a so inextricably mix do with the governments of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when the U.S forces finally reached a\nCobble a in some cases a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money does not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases is thinking that we could do things like this on the cheap and the quick\nParticularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the uh\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road\nSo that's\nExactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nAnd let us to do nothing in Syria where now when you have Russian sources we have a rainy and forces and we have terrorists or says ah you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we should be everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nWide six six by boat jumbo when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who goes in east Texas and Marty\nYeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now the historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that I'm\nNot a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought in marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map or that were discovered the world they were going to be part of the progress that brings us to the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the\nAh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notion is against ah you know I'm collective is notions and that's that's\nSomething that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will well\nI I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller is right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position that no other country was in an idle some of it has to do with geography you know we talked about\nBeing surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also\nAbout ... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability\nTo send forces maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect an international economy in a way the benefit of the road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know\nWhether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has shaped history with its with it says well yes\nAnd and then of course it is it this way if there is an arc of history we certainly are ... yet in a position to be able to [noise]\nUh accurately predicted one eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a available uh uh to be heard not only on our affiliates stations but also a jumbo had a show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight hello Gail [noise]\nHere's Jim I'm just want to comment on a lot of your guests are views um [noise] ... like a career I'm like Japan has [noise] I'm pretty uh arrangements are United States and and under certain conditions are we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S show after into a into another major conflict is is there a Korea or Japan or attack and a lot of people don't realize it or not that many years ago this war's United States territory\n[noise] until Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of a of the Philippines I'm not sure how many ah potential major conflicts exist and that is to say I'm not sure just exactly how many countries out there that are covered in the Philippines these days [noise]\nOne day our day we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building artificial island into\nAreas that are are are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters point taken [noise]\nAll right let's let our guests commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea and the possibility\nThat that these are arrangements might drag us into a large conflict and Robert Kagan\nAll I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies that will deter\nChina from attacking bad whereas we call back in ... and those kinds of it that's\nWhen you will encourage Chinese attacks and then I think we all get drawn in\nThat conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain the and a half to get into war is if we think we could stay out of the conflict\nThat involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last half century that we can stay out of those kinds of conflicts\n[noise] and uh if we try to do so uh uh we've we've tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor in our time will usually wind up with either one [noise]\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balance SARS but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties the consequences of that was going to have a fight on shore so I think it's better to provide the stability of the security arrangements\n[noise] stay with us or more to come by one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six Robert Kagan I guess he is the Freedman senior

you say that if you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this to be a very long call [noise] I\nDon't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states doing any first strikes [noise]\nWell okay I'm not sure that uh that we have any comment plated or as a matter of ah of your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further first strike I doubt that we're ever mind to go around let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of action option although my guess would be that there may be\nPlaces and circumstances in which proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse at something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the beneficial [noise]\nYeah I mean we certainly are we I Can't imagine those using nuclear weapons or the first strike that stuff's not in our policy in it and it it is not going to be but but yes if if we saw a crisis developing a that might result for instance in another terrorist attack or\nA in a in a war that we could forestall a by taking some action I think we have to be willing to do that as we have in the past and ah and you know try to do with his intelligence live selectively as possible but you can't rule out the possibility of using force although not nuclear force if that's what the caller's talking about\nOr they begin to be the key is in the term of first strike\nA more to come what eight six six five oh Jim boats what should be the American role in the world regardless of what we would like it to be what is the best role in a in a

is a ... you know the famous ... you're probably in her bedroom or were highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray tragedy or the common\nFan at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources though they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in the hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical so I mean\nPeople just don't get along at certain points in times when they bring something of a reserve a value for them or their their uh ethnicity is going to be taken away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnd other goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAt the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was that somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while there never was a full fledged war in South\nA conflict in quite a while there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons\nThat they in fact later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you will want to look at at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nA Northern Ireland would still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure what Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[laughter] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people evading show there forever fighting each other forever [noise]\nUh you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to bring Europe to peace and yet and yet we were able to you know I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily\nDo in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example a and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other\nOr not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nAnd then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test year things are made better I think that's a much more plausible ... was tests for any course of action thank you for your call labs we go to Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hi

decisions he made\nYou know using one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react he would react\nI don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely you would probably out cabin are Kavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context the Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared to the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise]\nYeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter the category of ah\nWho cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so [noise] yeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie

I think airplane if they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to vote I just think that the state just again just ... ended up followers\nDo they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well formed an opinion based on what some celebrity says that's\nThe part with which I differ that they both have the right to speak out of without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect your show a lot and that again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out there now\nThat that ...

[noise]\n\n\nIt is\nThat time again flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross golf a lot of uh what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states um flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming season is going to be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExactly and for those who say well I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen or something they need to realize that as a flu virus was a very sneaky thing that keeps changing honest\nYeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be\nThe thing that we are going to be seen most of it in the coming season so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nThis look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nHe has so last season that she doesn't Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's your seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very sustained across the country for\nMany weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're going to see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the\nOlder and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely to develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have that and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um\nThose under five years of age particularly under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nUm all that said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who could have you know if you take any individual\nWhat individuals are going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults\nCan get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this here on the two basic types that he wanted to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu shots and then we have on the nasal spray vaccine\nShots are given with a needle generally and they um are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been enacted editing killed so it can cause disease [laughter] and then the nasal spray\nAll or with virus that's been activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't multiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competed to make that choice ah [noise] ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm\nOne of the many things that very about flu is a vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another\nUm for the most important thing people can do is talk to their health care provider about what's accents they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions we can take against flu it seemed like every year we're told we sure do always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to um get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended\nI'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's it\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread germs to other people and those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu antiviral medicines take those medicines\nDot org is by E R s St Louis yesterday here who\n\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard ... president from threatening\nTo send the

try to be honest candid\nAnd open up here too because sometimes\nThey were trying to be honest candid and open up here too because sometimes your to your guts\nTo get them off of artistic it's not like the way they were doing in Donald Trump him under the bus and back in that buzz on him and that he had been in the public eye for all these years and not one time they called in those nasty nasty and they said it running against Hillary Clinton [noise]\nWell there's certainly there was a shall we say a major turnaround in it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously something that has something to the major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he was making them out accepts science bills into law they cannot accept to the dictates national policy in accordance with the constitution\nOr this was a major problem for men and it's been now two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in yeah he really did when\nHe will eat with all of a complex Schmidt look at what he's a team for two years have done more than Obama but the one eight years but they don't like President Trump is not a career politician is a businessman I\nAlways say if you want to know what's going on with the body look at the head to head it's prosperous [laughter] that's for the body of people are going to be successful and look at the day what's happening\n[noise] well there's no question about the fact that he's a certainly had a a major impact into I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rally to his ah his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held a for a candidate Trump and President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nI Can't tell somebody from is it out for us um and it's so he came in North Carolina there was no way they were going to be here in North Carolina we not be there so it was a race for us to be at one of his rallies he\nInvited on his stage it's like we didn't have to take it's like he gave it to us to let us say whatever we wanted to say all of those cameras back there that that was probably over a hundred of them\nAnd um I think that was just after that I think that next January will be open up for a rally\nAnd we've opened up for so many of them yeah I'm ... I just can't column this week they didn't plan it we didn't we didn't have to reach out to any body weight it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to oh well I\nReally think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he or that people will people\nUm he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct Donald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president\nI mean he ... he looked at who you hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire he\nHears a billionaire identity hang out with the paypal paypal because hey go ahead\nSo yes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly to set people nobody saw him he's not beholden to\nHollywood or the lobbyist nobody bought him a paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nI analyze it off and look at the left wing media how they spin the laziest gossip stories live and they always mayor who they fear they fear because they know either way they don't try this out losers but they will try and stop all winter\nAnd now they they certainly are they taking aim at you of course now too I mean you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do and that really upset them\nThey didn't say that they will come along a diamond is that people will stop speaking out like God I mean\nYou know they want to hear for continuing with the same to get to read\nAs thinking on the inside of the box not saying that they can't remember now what Obama did back in the day I'm a staff that Obama can create economic opportunity for people he puts ... how they would want to end up with the topic\nAnd the puppet masters toilet train [laughter] look at
