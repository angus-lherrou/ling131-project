I Know the the reason for it because both issues are cowards and they want to keep the job and all the time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what the get elected for was to tackle these issues\nAnd I said that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude is published by encounter books and stuff to all of a last chance to rain and the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nPleasure to be with you absolutely\nThe Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with you Jim\nAbsolutely out your thoughts if you would on on the witness trend really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it as it is a a imminently challenge a bowl of there will be the word\nBut it's it's a very much challenge of all and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in the what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty\nWhen there were many social and economic changes going on in the country\nAnd the people who are then progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all these problems\nAnd so we had to make some major constitutional changes appoint a lot of smart or a ... ... people who had no interest in a particular issue but we're credentialed and an intelligent and would make decisions on the basis of what is best for the country\nAnd they thought of those people as it ministry leaders and officials of the government they wanted more such people to be put into place in the federal government and make many more regulatory and administrative decisions that was how it all began\nAnd uh it has developed since then through a whole series of decisions made and made in the government and made by the people in some cases when they elected Woodrow Wilson is president so that\nWe're glad you're with us on the jumbo haven't showed one eight six six five oh jumbo six six five oh five or six to six [laughter]\nWell I got to say it's about time and thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute\nWho's the website ... H. E. I. dot org somebody needs to be done about this tendency of Congress to pass the buck to the other like the bureaucrats and those three letter agencies and elsewhere but the three letters or a good place to start\nA potentially writing general outlines of laws and letting him at the agency spilling the details right the laws\nAnd uh right I'm going to be done about that uh we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison than the good evening doc welcome thank\nYou for taking my call is August ... just a warrant you a quick question for his team metro also all hell just set aside less it of course I was always\nMr Austin where you see this court has got their President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch should conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed us to a second dropped or what you just wanted\nJuicy just court filing turning back tributes out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future it out or what your thoughts are that sir\nBut did you have two questions that\nThat was that was your are your ... where do you should accord going on over the shooter that we could turn back the tide I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good at ... you go again in other words the yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nLike in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kavanaugh there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... that Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four I declared that the lower courts\nTo defer to the to the interpretations of various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress to grow their powers now with cabin or they're\nHe's a constitutional list is it ... list [laughter] just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question\nAnd now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that the debt federally Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after [noise]\nA boy it's a remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face with voters [noise] the the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\n[laughter] I\nCourts don't what what are they so reluctant about\nWell I think they really are concerned about not having any direct support from the public\nSupport from the public at I mean if we don't have an associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that the areas of that but Alexander Hamilton was white and when he talked about fortitude [laughter] because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThat judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nWhy shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches in a democracy the elected branches the president or Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking\nFor the people the courts are only speaking for the constitution [noise]\nUm so they had been since that those decisions in Nineteen thirty five [noise]\nAnd the effort by the president and after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing that well\nWe certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight good evening\n[noise] either thanks for taking my call sure [noise] so rich and I just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] uh your gifts to [noise]\nYou know he said that a\nRepublican or a democracy and I agree with that and I agree with you know kind of timeframe ruin the problem started you know it's also around that time from what I've read where [noise]\nYou start you know people start calling us democracy is not a Republican I heard your guest say several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look there's one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the blunt where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea [noise]\nUm we we can even talking about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that uh Peter\n[laughter] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people go running through\nThe legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nConservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that the founders didn't like was it democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in and in some kind of I'm kind of a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... will as a good idea that's right so what was going to we'll come back to that it's time allows but right now a call from Sharon in crane Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah [laughter] kind of again that's why maybe I in my face back I'm very much and that could have a constitutional convention\nAnd why are the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one that we had cats and they turn ...\nFor the legislative branch and the reigning power a executive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd that gets ... chair cannot [noise] I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWhen that change that balance so that the courts possibly would any stat that kid that plate a little bit more because it's like to have to take more responsibility All right\nFor the way the way I see it and the way I discuss it in the book is that if the court actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch at the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nExactly did they made for the ... are coming up in a break that does that move here so we will amplify on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\nDoes your basement

conventions could also be the method are proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention failed and three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so up Peter\n[noise] yeah well that that's exactly right that had to have the system but it it's important to understand we have the ... the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing\nThe government to slip away out of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going away until the

you're twenty Republican Congress pursuits to\nChill out trophy hunters Ariel Hi Anne Kane our national park in Alaska any is down there in regards to sea lion murdering\nGay well before we go too far off the deep end the pita there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done at this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter and in fact a if in fact Congress went along with it\nHowever a wise or unwise decision may have been uh it wouldn't be the subject we're talking about tonight I don't believe that\nNo not unless it was an action that was not surprised by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress has an authorized it and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it is in that in fact that's what we're talking about and that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress if\nIt uh uh the ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough that you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary into Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nSkating jam that thanks for having me on the shores pickup\nGary [noise] getting\n... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on your your high agree with almost everything your guest has said bomb a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy lawyers that it really it we're getting into some added federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time to sit to explain it on your show but anyway and then the\nThe main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think it think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs us ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another and let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing given fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now be a term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress\nBut he had a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally although you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as if this has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used to date where all amendments start with Congress than we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBigger let me add one thing they're ... and I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these bureaucracies\nBut how do you how do you persuade short of of of some method of of of course uh uh how ... how do you persuade\nThe uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not just suddenly say gee Peter you're right you're going to have\nTo arm twist these people are going to have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read this book is a great read but I don't think I'd want to do\nThat may suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who are who are willing I think to take exactly the position that I'm advocating in the book\nIn fact judge Kavanaugh now justice Kevin in in a decision and twenty Fifteen when an agency went beyond what are the ... the statute authorized\nA he was over ruled at the at the court where he was serving but he said look when an agency take steps that are not authorized and its statute they have to go back to Congress and

the chair of mainstream mental health Dr Huber thank you for being with us today\nThank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents that I guess most of us understand the it is a term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults would that be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nI'm not sure that's a pretty good definition and I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nBecause their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh ... that's something else that it it seems to be that\nThe generation that has provided us with helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they are I mean ... it's hard for me to think that\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that of parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people ah it it seems to be that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own and the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back\nThat many generations does it\nReally I mean there's some there's some small groups of people have always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation it as a whole [noise] you know the baby boomer\nBut if we go back and look at our generation it as a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents had to had to scrimp and saving do without during the war and so we found a lot of those individuals\nYou know the great grandparents great grandparents would store\nYou know thirty cans of core and even though the grocery store having three cans for a dollar down the road and that generation said okay I don't want to I don't want to hoard things like\nThat so they started easing up a little bit that the greatest generation\nWas are afraid of you know what happens if we end up in the same kind of situation again they want it to be

kind of a of a originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know but I have ever actually met a helicopter parents much less a lawnmower parent [laughter]\nWell I don't think

in Destin, Florida tonight and I gather that things are still pretty much a mess they're Clayton [noise]\nGym you're right you know will hit the forty eight hour marks and Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida not far from where I Am now a early tomorrow afternoon and yet there are still when you have a known here\nAs search and rescue efforts are ongoing in fact they just started today because many roads are still\nImpassable there's people from the Panama City beach area who ... who are still not able to get back in\n... there are so many roads blocked off their archery down in

Lee compassionate to we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dreaded diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life [noise]\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's necessary part of growing up and in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up as how I grew up making mistakes\n\nI a good look back on my mistakes in their various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about boy was I'd dumb [noise]\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that wasn't fun but I have a better person because of it [noise]\nAnd it sounds made that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation to parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it [noise] as I say it it is difficult for me to even conceive of of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\n[noise] live and apparently what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright [noise]\nOr you could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate by child will not ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years above formative life and learn nothing yet\nBecause every chance they have to learn how to get away and make sure that they don't learn to accept maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group about a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment\nWhen they they followed by the side with correct the behavior all the things that are yes hassles ... and sometimes we even pay for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce I mean you know you're having a kid [noise]\nThis is what you're supposed to do [noise]\nIt's it's interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can't figure that out [laughter]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat [noise] we were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes you grew up who had children\nAnd they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I Would always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids are supposed to carry on that's the whole point I Would have produced kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone [noise]\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering um how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past and my lacking in compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment or heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem [noise]\nWhat eight six six by boat jumbo is our number\nOne eight six six five oh five four six to six I I'm just I'm just curious about it to me it is just astounding\nThat this can happen all that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few brain dead do five okay I accept that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but it sounds like\nMuch more than that it sounds like a trend dada universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend\nThat you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all\nI don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this\nI I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and [noise] and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say [laughter] life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain\nSome\nPain of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's it's essential it's essential one eight six six five oh jumbo to wander in Hopkins ville Kentucky a good evening welcome to\nThe African aid and then I think the problem today is that parents have become that channel that showed that have it come back\nWe'll certainly the parents of the children are ... are in many cases I I started like nobody's because the parents [laughter]\nI've seen that speak today passed away about oh my God it not matter if they just got a lot I guess it would be unbelievable\nI cannot believe that no they can't talk now with that said oh I'm I'm just about getting a race had no response that God allows just it's just hard\nIt is horrible and and it it does it look what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable I mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable\nPeople are kids left to their own devices or are they will they will produce some pretty frightening circumstances\n... society a yeah I mean\nThey they their children to go I mean I'm just looking at some of them is just Sunday that is what they meant tolerate that just so unbelievable like these people put that those

I Know the the reason for your Bones Are cowards and they want to keep the job and the time you tackle a serious problem\nIt probably is still a problem because there's some controversy attached to it and politicians hate that well that's what the got elected for was to tackle these issues\nNow I see that that thought has been flushed out in a considerable study by Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who has written judicial fortitude and published by encounter books and stuff to all of a last chance to rein in the administrative state that Peter thank you for joining us tonight\nMy pleasure good to be with your gym\nAbsolutely out your thoughts of you would on on the witness print really began and and how it has managed to avoid being challenged in court because to me it as it is a uh imminently challenge a bowl of there would be such a word\nIt's it's a very much challenge of all and I hope that this book will encourage the court to start looking at this issue but it really began I think in the what was called the progressive era between the Eighteen eighties and about Nineteen twenty\nWhen there were many social and economic changes going on in the country\nAnd the people who are thin progressive is led by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt\nThought that the constitution was just too rigid to deal with all of these problems\nAnd so we had to make some major constitutional changes appoint a lot of smart or a ... ... people who had no interest in a particular issue but we're credentialed and and intelligent and we'd make decisions on the basis of what is best for the country\nAnd they thought of those people as it ministry leaders and officials of the government\nThey wanted more such people to be put into place in the federal government and make many more regulatory and administered at decisions that was how it all began\nAnd uh it has developed since then\nWe're glad you're with us on the jumbo had a joke one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nI got to say it's about time but thank goodness for Peter Wallison senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who's the website it's relieves their initials H.

place to start\nA singer like writing general outlines of laws and letting him be the agency's filling the details right the laws\nAnd uh I'm going to be done about that uh we have a calling from ... from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison the good evening doc welcome thank\nYou for taking my call is ... just a one or two quick questions for is a metro also outages genocide list it of course there's always\nMr wall some words you see this court has got to President Trump on her opportunity under justice Gorsuch should conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed us to a second dropped or what you just pointed\nJuice you to court filing turning back tribute out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future it out or what are your thoughts on that sir\n[noise] but they do have two questions duck and it was just that\nWas your are you are at war or you should accord going on over the shooter that we could turn back the tide I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good uh butter I used to be going on in other words I Will ... cabinet tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude [laughter]\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nLike ed in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Canada are there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that have led us to this position\nI'm the one that is most important here is one called ... that Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower courts to defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange because it leaves the courts out entirely and so\nThat that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from Congress to grow their powers now with cabin on the air\nCongress or to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list [laughter] just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question\nAnd now he has four other justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that the debt federally Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA ... it's just remarkable you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face with voters [noise] the courts don't want to be so reluctant about\n[laughter] [laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any direct support from the public\nSupport from the public and I mean if we don't even associate with the public they they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton was white and when he talked about fortitude [laughter] because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts\nThat judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nWhy shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches\nIn a democracy the elected branches the president or Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people\nThe courts are only speaking for the constitution [noise]\nUm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen Seventy five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches [laughter] so I think is a reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota denied good evening [noise]\nEither thanks for taking my call sure [noise] so rich and turned it on here and I didn't I haven't [noise] uh your guests student was [noise]\nYou know you said that a\nRepublican voter democracy and I agree with that agree with you know kind of the time frame ruin the so the problem started I you know it's also around that time or from what I've read where [noise]\nYou start you know people start calling us democracy is not a Republican since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look there's one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's a while though and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where that is technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea [noise]\nUm we can even talking about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works or anything you want to add to that a leader\nYou know I think that's exactly right I think many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people got running through\nThe legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure and so\nShould not worry about calling something a democracy\nThat democracy that that the founders didn't like was it democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in and in some kind of I'm kind of a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the newly how no we'll loves a good idea that's right so we'll we'll get we'll come back to that it's time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon and crane Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\n[laughter] again and that's why I think maybe I Am right Fox face back I'm married and movement can have a constitutional convention\nAnd why didn't I I thought the things that I Hope comes out of there if we do have one that we had cats and turn them that's\nFor a legislative branch and the reigning power of executive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd that legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would [noise] any stat that to the plate a little bit more because it's like to have to take more responsibility\nFor the way the way I see it and the way I discuss it in the book is that if the courts actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch at the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself the ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions exactly\nDid they made for the ... coming up in a break that does that move here so we will amplify on that thought when we come back in the moment\n\nThere's your

we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy lawyers that it really is we're getting into some added steadily\nYeah yeah yeah it it does mean something to me but I don't have the time to sit to explain it on your show but anyway and then the\n... the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and fake it think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to go off and right\nHere but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time but that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now the term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress be at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as it just has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used today we're all amendments start with Congress than we can forget about any of those things ever happening\nBecause let me add one thing they're ... and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBureaucracies but how do you how to use for swayed short of of of some method of of of force\nUh uh how how do you persuade\nThe uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they've gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not going to just suddenly say gee Peter your rights so you're gonna have\nTo arm because these people are going to have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read his book is a great read but I don't think I Want to do is\nLet me say this and I I I agree that it's tough but we have five members of the Supreme Court now who are who are willing I think to take exactly the position that I'm advocating in the book\nAnd in fact judge Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh said in in a decision in twenty Fifteen when an agency went beyond what are the ... the statute authorized\nHe was over ruled at the at the court it where he was and serving but he said look when an agency take steps that are not authorized and its
