second choice and I also say wait at least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\nYou know it's got to be tough as a dad to watch people beat up on her little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWho else is that you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think

fighting and stuff that they believe that it said you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you why I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or\nTV or as a governor or the politician\nConcerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear a hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about dead and I think ... uh I Would ask you I mean do you think that this has more to do about abortion\nThat does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a cow and and in large measure because the locals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and revisit a rosy weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution but what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or\nReversed it doesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it through the issue of person who it is because if we wouldn't accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn every person is a person from the point of conception\nIn the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie wait a ruling ever could be\nIn protecting life liberty and pursuit of happiness and would provide due process and would make it impossible\nFor anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I really hope that that's where we ended up moving with their speakers there should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGo up to ten seconds here am I then I Want you to stay on the line we'll speak all fair but I was doing a little checking your the calendar on

glitches which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over their shoulder I mean what's interesting is a ... who's this a PHD used to always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how\nGoogle could swing an election\nUh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of votes\nIn a while you know one direction or the other uh by shifting millions of votes spy controlling the information they got a Washington Post ran a story on\n... and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the shell you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a block to my Google or from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has a millions of people that have downloaded his concept so\nIt does happen to people or more often than you think it just demonstrates the power that this company has to decide if they're aware of\nUh how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites [noise] well I mean that's why they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think the example you just gave our our particularly no worthy of Maine is sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the oil being that I that I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYou know that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that ...\nThat is particularly interesting we'd go to this in the in the film is during the twenty sixteen election or they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John a a blind way um but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was all five six month period\nAnd then they captured all the search results that equal God now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states something with the Republicans were Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social economic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know\nThings seem to be pretty balanced what Google in every single searched position of the\nTop ten search results\nAs the results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhere they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump in the same search results um and you know by his estimate that this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't\nHelp the results at the end of the day but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is science essentially political but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nOh and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses his real concern is do we really want to have a company\nHaving so much control over the flow of information that win undecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that one day sort sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the one

Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's been doing a search engines um\nThere used to be I click which had a they they have another one called start page the same company but they got rid of X like and that was if you didn't want to use Google result he wanted other result\nAnd I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them suppress I click or what happened to it and I use that that go [noise]\nYeah I Know that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in the space so look at apple for example apple has the search engine called safari\nThought safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google was actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing the research is but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that\nBecause they wanted the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing everywhere and you're exactly right star page a\nIs a a search engine you get great results they actually use Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without\nGate of the presence item that is that is going to change of ... biggest struck a de becoming more popular it was a deal struck a while ago Dr go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is Google\nBut the place that you pay is they collect all this information on you and they are prepared to use that information against you\nTo either ... or manipulate you in a way for commercial gain or [noise] or other parts of their agenda and there really are not many great options out there um there's even you know discussions about the fact that thing\nWhich is a Microsoft product which is sort of the great rival\nTo Google essential in twenty six teams struck a commercial agreement a Microsoft and Google struck a commercial agreement\nWe don't know exactly what that agreement is but um they essentially have stopped being so hostile to Google with a lot of people believe that there is some kind of ... where they're doing a search they're cooperating and search so that's part of the challenge there really aren't

S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of wheat\nColumbia says okay will specialize in jest making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee and we'll trade our coffee for you and we\nBoth countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources so\nFree trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example that make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make we\nAre the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an egg is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is what happens is the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else\nBut they said we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the Rob is with with Canada\nTo a call from Sharon in crane Missouri a good evening Sharon\n... and not have made a point I heard today only ... radio is that China has announced it that they are going to be paying tariffs\nOn it I didn't fight fight and and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and fact\nBased at trade agreement that we had had\n...

jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six were talking to Dr Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst and we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet it has to get congressional approval\nBut it I suppose it it does a lot of a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress\nWould be able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this\nLet's go to David who calls in from San Francisco divide to David good evening [noise]\nYes I Am a and your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major of financial problems\nDirectly tied to this Chinese steel and uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just probably short of five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right\nRight yeah and in fact if you remember just a dollar value uh at at getting the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in cost and six billion in finance so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich\nAnd I was defective when it when it opened\nEyes are you saying that that was built with with Chinese steel oh yeah and what was going well I didn't know that yeah and what was significant about it or not was the governor\nOkay well I didn't know then yeah and what was significant about it Arnold was the governor and this crush more today right okay yeah that\nWas the Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely customs\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part\nAre you know each part had happened inspectors massive arch each almost to the to the man they refused to accept delivery unload parched yet it was over written by a project manager who had no right to override\n... that that sounds like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I I guess the professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese\nTo a Kurd in Rochester, Minnesota is a mixed up below courage\nI you know the thing that bothers me about a a steel who from China is if you drive a car a lot and you have to have your brakes done you may have found out over the last Twenty years that you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them\nBut nowadays everybody has to you throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper but the quality is also cheaper\nRight I Want our guest to comment about that we've had two calls are regarding the quality of of dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean you know when you when you buy a a broom and Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the ... brew him out there you want something that will sweep the floor [laughter] ah but there's something like this is well I mean a indicates will break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe if you will die or is that another problem\nIn trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\n[noise] yeah that's that's always an issue of products like steel obviously quality is essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause a severe a\nInjuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer products look at the textile in industry so if the California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real they shared that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers the al ... purchase much more uh goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept the worst of those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all [noise] I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy strictly around consumers uh that that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the twenty sixteen presidential election\nThat's right uh so uh up until Donald Trump the the thought was well look let's try to get these products to the consumers that the lowest possible price even if you have to sacrifice a low quality get it at the lowest possible price", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "07"}
