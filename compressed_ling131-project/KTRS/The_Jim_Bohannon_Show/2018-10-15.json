... you know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those roads you should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if you're in your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there on the other people that I meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major rose to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nBut when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say\nFor let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this leach we've gotta do to through this direction\nTo that location so this way family members who you rely on\nThose even as the people on the other side cannot get that signal meaning that tax to the email message wise that tower chimes on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once in their ... their cell phone reaches that sour\nNot as ... as did the ... thank you for your call them ... and your thoughts your or how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nMakes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said and activate your GPS for\nYour family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in the times of\nWeather related problems such as like all the stars get\nWeather related problems such as like all the stars get thrown down you know it can take our technology and if the towers that enabled that you're sending a signal to went down ...\n... ... dance single you all get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message\nBut if they hit another power that the active they will instantly receive those messages so as long as you're standing up saying no you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will we see there was a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had to do with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the ... good evening Patrick\n... is a very very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script for a movie [laughter] why not just um uh [noise]\nUh [noise] hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific the at new killer it would\nRain radioactive waste [noise] but they are getting on well\nThat's a nuclear bomb to get you to know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes by\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea there's just too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states less so let's say you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with a song and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida liable for this storm and damaging to states other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through ... city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hits you got to be upset\nYeah and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding a part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and handed inland\nAnd the ... he was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding cause this but I I don't believe that ever again that was tried so a lot of the fact is that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly up\nA lot of uh just simply change of course in and damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I mean it could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with exact precision look take some more callers will be an athlete Kobe\nAnd his book is emergency prepping civil disaster preparedness for the Modern

in the Philippines open our places like that where you don't evacuate because the government who's who you're there for says we're not going anywhere\nIn fact we're going to go out and take care of

it's\nAlways been holders value for me it's it's really a state\nThe same or ... in the last year and I was wanting to know if ... if he feels that still a place to hold value [noise]\nI think of it as an insurance policy scary it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down after many other commodities an interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower the math so I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and still does not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that have been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't say go going up dramatically anytime soon what\nAbout other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same silver has gone down dramatically a platinum is kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lightweight zone none of the pressure smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your service as well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these around certain times on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so I go to some joint well it could really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that has all bad for gold silver and talking about him\nBut do you see a interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market\nWe basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peak at about fourteen percent of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though is about more than three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is there a strike on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not an empire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month for the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's what our for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening some when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing and letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New that just that corner mountains today there are options of the thirty about in the nearby they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply and demand\nYields and we'll go up and prices go down\nThere you go to the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to go back and talk to some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about ... when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving\nThe student loan
