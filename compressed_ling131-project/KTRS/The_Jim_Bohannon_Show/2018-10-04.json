might look like outsiders when really their insiders and talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course a world court and there are various ah ah bodies that the United nations most notably the Security Council and the like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be a particularly prone to\nTo depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases ... that best and the\nAnd the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious

dangerous because it's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm an ... that side of how we all get along come by uh I I don't want this weapon given\nThought to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of the still\nAnd and we're seeing this kid again it's a fundamental lack of

things about twentieth century that but ah we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point of like for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack and and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody hack something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election
