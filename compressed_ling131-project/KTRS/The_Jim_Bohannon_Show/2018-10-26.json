with just where you would start that is to say at what point could you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist well\nSing about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people\nBefore there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people who felt perfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe well the planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nThat feels like they have been cheated or that they have been wrong or that their interests are being worked against off in in in the various way be they'd bankers be elites me they

are cooking the books against us and we don't like it\nUm so this is this has ever been with us but certainly the first time you get a leader who breaks through that's when you get Andrew Jackson and his three presidential elections and a real revolution\n[noise] now it would be safe to say I believe that we probably therefore had populace impulses\nBefore necessarily the system allowed them to be

products on an airplane every state\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYeah what about the jumbo had showed one eight six six five votes jumbo six six five oh five or six to six I can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall I may have a a\nThing that the twist you through I guess of like a three hundred and sixty degree a thing is kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second do you do you do what ride that was\nYes I Do actually is one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew\nWhich is just gave you the exactly that that was um why should I think it was called the ... or something along those lines and was very short it only had that one little uh that want that one little\nArea but yes I'm very familiar with it in a in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and then of course Opry land with a great place to put an amusement park right next to the ah the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nAh I most viewed it definitely woke me up but I remember that that we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers are there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a little bit tired at this point and and\nHe woke me up Yes sir that there'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did\nWas actually called the wall Bosch cannon ball of fire as a fiery\nOut oh yeah all that job well anyway I'll put it this way it didn't lead me say this was off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as a as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's what I paid to do it again no not really but then again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the places out there when you think Halloween can thrill rides\n... drove you go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started I actually uh uh a no I'm In law actually have started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that come to light of course the universal studios\nAll went to their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on now you know pretty much American horror story the walking dead the shining the right place to go a pretty scary now you want to go to the river\nLooking at the shining great place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse than\nTo a place where you have to be totally scared and and uh you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World and Disneyland that have the ... not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you got the vote are you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the all the same or some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all of the Six Flags locations have the site fast\nWhich is your cleric classic scare zones all you know when you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewer and this that the story of soles in which is layer and places like that um [noise]\nAnd of course you to point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin or fast that that goes on there on ... high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had or addition for one of these shows at Six Flags and are they really are they really get into this big time uh I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll I'll save and change the the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over at scare winds are which is a heroines in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street\nUh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course that meant that scare crows in zombies and ... and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen side that actually do this and uh they're just a you know the rise are still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate [noise] over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid gloves scary right [noise] well the\nGood thing about all these places where there were universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's not going to basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the fight fast and the phantom\nLights over Kenny would a hell of a screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens\nAnd of course ... and and that is not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned ... others\nUm during the day you know during the day if it really is it like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and is um these awake and that's pretty much most of these places where if you if you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened\nYou probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do you ever scares zones their actual zone where you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you it it it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are are just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or having a ... I Can't have a traumatic experience with that\nSort of the way the the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer [noise]\nAbsolutely I mean that's the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and um [noise] uh there are rules and regulations that they follow you know normally if you're an older person you know they're they're probably not going to\nTry to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal or or something along those lines so yeah there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and get the full one hundred percent presentation and others [noise]\nThey know when to back down and do they know if ... if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program for the reasons why I I like uh he's in his in parts and what they do and how they train people\nIn order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many uh and again there are there is there a scare zones and they're ... as a you know if you're going into a scare zone and then you know something is going to happen\nAnd I want to go back and take a look at that in

view go have we become jaded and all of this that is to say uh you have to constantly come up with new things but the the been there done that syndrome is something that plagues the people who who run the thrill rides\n[noise] that's that's the key I mean going back to the ... that you rode over a um I guess I have to be at least\nThirty years ago in order to do that you know from now take here um you know people that love to ride roller coasters or or or get you know that's that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want well of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because\nThey want to keep your writers conscious during the entire ride and\nSo so you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now it's actually a lot better to know how many how much the force or how many G forces that body can take not up tight like somebody who's experienced and trained to do that and in good physical shape\nSo that's the big key is to be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know I have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur and that's why stimulation rides or actually a very big these days\nI what I mean by that is the track never actually really moves\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or or D glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment that looks like it's actually moving for example soaring is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation right take much smaller footprint there are a little less money but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes it pretty much all goes away\n[laughter] interesting uh if you buy that we've never experience these are these virtual environments where they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that or the number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of the thrill rides to emulate a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games well\nNot necessarily video games because of their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but\nYou didn't mention like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or different events like track of course the movie you'll find the universal studios\nBut as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays that big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense what you do is you put on these for the glasses that and they cover your entire face\nA wire going through a smaller roller coaster and feeling the wind and the reason to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down\nAnd that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit as now more intense so that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest ... tribute go I read it\nI just wanted to share something with you we're now in the last week of the great month long state therapy\nAnd my daughter took her four year old grandson to that fair and she told me that our

come up and pretend that child Hi Tammy\nPainted on the inside but if a child gets lost their parents to update that's that's\nAn interesting thought utterly of to say the least and encouraging one safety a general upbeat tribute goes that some people to practice did all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park\nIt directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents of problems that occurred at a particular place the again the very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen it'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News\nOr one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash so it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially\nAt places like uh you know as a Six Flags or Disney a Busch Gardens are Cedar Fair or they do that on purpose because obviously we want them to everybody wants to have a a a good outcome now the the carnival than the fares though the state fairs\nAre starting to come on board with the same\nSecurity and technology with the blade bracelets and so on down the line which is a very very good thing to have because these days you never know what's going to happen and you know we always tell people\nThey don't always go and pears always tell the parents where you're going to be in more than most importantly they all go alone especially on under age or you shouldn't be doing that but if that does happen there are a lot of security or devices that that are at these parks or that can

I was under the impression that they were not detonated so as that that to keep the components are intact enough to uh to examine them I think that they were certainly diffused and I know the term that has been used by the big government potentially explosive devices which makes me wonder\nIf they might not have contained explosives but we're not hooked up in such a way as to go off which would certainly explained why none of them did but I don't believe that\nThat they were were detonated because you would be this growing evidence\nBy mistake well I I I think so yeah I was just what it was

not heard any information about these things that have been called\nA potentially explosive devices I found that term to be a rather intriguing in terms of government euphemisms potentially explosive devices says to me that it's something that contains explosive materials but it's not\nHooked up in such a way that it would go off now that that could be reading more into it than the government intended for that's how it sounds\nLike a man who cares that either will end up for it it's still up\nA well it is edited it still is dangerous and all but it certainly matters in terms of how it was put together if for example\nLet's say I jam a bunch of a diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate or something into a package like the Oklahoma City bombing [noise]\nBut I don't include any detonator or method by which it could be set off then that would be a potentially explosive device but it would not be something that you could expect to go off and that makes a lot of difference in terms of the the the motive of whoever was behind this [noise]\nOh yes sir um [noise] I [noise]\nI don't know anything about ... ... ... the charts falls to\n[noise] good good absolutely good\n... good certainly are in in in in terms of human safety and possibly good in determining a motive if you go to the trouble is sending out a device that is designed not to go off\nAnd at least in the case of the Britain

for joining us tonight\nWell it certainly my pleasure thank you for having me\nAbsolutely let's start with just where you would start that is to say at what point did you say we had a political leader who could be defined as a populist well\nThink about it this way in American history even before there was a country or even before there was a constitution even in the discussion about drafting the constitution there were people who felt\nPerfectly convinced absolutely sure that there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe well the planners in Virginia\nWho were conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population that feels like they have been cheated or that they have been wronged or that their interests are being worked against often and then the fairest way\nBe they'd bankers be the elites me they whomever a and\nPopulism when we have outbursts when we have a rupture and a popular sentiment in the United states it's when that constituents he gets to be large enough\nSo you know we all read the federalist papers of everybody knows Alexander Hamilton because of the play and all of that stuff but while they were doing that there were anti federalist too there were people who said you guys are cooking the books against us and we don't like it\nUm so this is this has ever been with us but certainly the first time you get a leader who breaks through\nThat's when you get Andrew Jackson and his three presidential elections and a real revolution\n[noise] now it will be safe to say I believe that we probably therefore had populace impulses\nBefore necessarily the system allowed them to be heard very much because of course from the beginning well the electorate does start out with that in the beginning electric consisted of a of the white guys with a lot of property\nThere was a reactionary we've got to deal with this and these things but Roosevelt biggest concern when he when he called a Huey Long and Douglas McArthur the two most dangerous man in America he was talking

Andrew Jackson was beginning his second term as president and Eighteen thirty three the board at Harvard University he thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws\nNow then the man he had beaten was a Harvard to allow them or they may John Quincy Adams and\nHis response to this as he wants told a cousin and this is a quote that has reverberated through his

and I are old hickory was a new sophisticated [noise] um and it's about like what is it like was uh interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's for Pete's sake\nSo I was I was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em but you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams the the belief among the founders and it very then um but even with Jefferson ah who invasion Yom

even among the ... the the the more democratically minded of the day it would have been hard to imagine\nThat there would be a leader arise that would not be from\nThe nobility from the from the ... right that you would not have the uh Presbyterian or not an Anglican uh not a congregation all that but that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia not from Massachusetts\nNot to the manner born not to the merchant class not a plan or but instead the frontiers but now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee he made himself amazingly well the\nUh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court or he was the states for senator\nHe was a general uh for them in the black hawk wars he did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk wars but in the uh uh the creek war\n[noise] and ah he did all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish men she fell way outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of man who would populated because the assumption was that there would be such a press that\nThe natural human preference for\nUm excellence for elite is an for those things would have drawn men from the same category but what they didn't count on was when you do have a wave of immigrants and you do change the makeup of the population the expectations and descriptions for what an excellent man might be will change [noise]\nAnd uh certainly over time ah they they obviously have a part of it I suppose the geographic it was the first or a president to came from uh west of the Appalachian Mountains\nAbsolutely and at westward expansion of the purpose so Jackson interesting Jackson's legacy is only ultimately sealed by James Paulk\nOne term president who sort of finished his work\nUm who uh after a a a diversion as a diversion fault gets back in and they finish the westward expansion everything was about moving west

how\nJackson [noise] you know it's it's interesting if you see yourself as a victim as Jackson did Jackson no matter how rich ... how powerful no matter how strong he became no matter how successful he ultimately saw himself as a victim as an aggrieved party and\nThe permission structure that grievance gives us is an interesting thing and it was very interesting which accent his heinous

you right here is Christopher walled in the book every mimicking\nIn the summer of Nineteen thirty five Huey Long was the sensation batch is an understatement\n... he was a while to man he was a wild thing and uh what's interesting is\nHe had he had run for the United States Senate a as a staunch basically to re consolidate power\nIn Louisiana and his intention was that he would try to hold the governorship and the Senate seat at the same time he wanted the legislature he was a lame duck and the legislature was being a was starting to a pale\nUh at the demands of the king fish the emperor of Louisiana all of the things that he told them to do there was they were starting to have some opinions and he did not like that so he ran he figured if he ran statewide for that Senate seat he could show his great power\nAnd he did but then he found out he couldn't do both show he wins but doesn't go sir waiting to Nineteen thirty two but he doesn't go serve until eventually constitutional crisis he uh has called out the state National Guard\nOr to prevent the lieutenant governor from the oath of office he said but eventually he finds a a more accommodating Lieutenant General uh our our lieutenant governor who will be applying to a vessel for the will of the king fish and then she we figure she has to go to Washington so he gets here\nAnd he finds out he can whip these people just as easily see whipped him down in Baton Rouge and that the reporters here are just like\nIf people just as easily as he whipped him down in Baton Rouge and that the reporters here are just like the reporters they're desperate for good copy desperate for wild stories he finds out that the same\nLevers of power that work there work here and he went right to work in the course of very little time he found himself eight absolute sensation a national political figure and people couldn't get enough of it\nHere as a floor speech just one excerpt from Huey Long talking to his fellow senators a mob is coming here and six months to hang the Ninety five and ... damn scoundrels I'm undecided whether the stick here with you or go out and to lead them\nWell okay we'll put you down as undecided over ...\n[laughter] now than there came a time when he became a something of a sensation about possibly challenging Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency what happened to at this point of uh of him grasping for the ultimate political power\nWill think about the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism\nIn Germany you have fascism in Italy and Spain you have a strong argument being made here including edit them with a bunch of American adherents people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh uh Joe Kennedy and others who said hey\nYou know maybe we ought to pay attention to this maybe this is a more modern scientific way to approach things uh and the moment we we take for granted\nOr our institutions are weak now relative to how they were say fifty years ago but we it's hard for us to grasp you know on the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed the American Nazi Party cling two hundred thousand members are a lot of the things and norms that we take for granted today in the pit of the great depression or not\nThat was not that was not everybody was an agreement that the American system was the best and long you know this very vivid apostle vis a vis a vis wild man who had an amazing gift for oratory and amazing gift for facts and figures could talk his way out of anything a and had developed because\nThe poor people in America show many poor people in America felt that he was one of them and understood their plight um it it was happening\nUm whether or not he was really getting challenged Roosevelt and thirty six I don't know he had a meeting Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to 'em but whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could topple Huey Long and when\nAnd when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and went and do so on a platform that basically called for repealing the American system that it was time that we had something more like a dictator who had the power to deal with entrenched interests who where he said we're harming the common people\nHow did he die\n[laughter] well I I Would say I would say absolutely um he was killed so a white as he was sort of reaching their peak or in August of thirty five is his big if he if he
