six or five oh jumbo interesting poll we've been talking about here from Steve Bannon's group [noise] and\nNiles damage our guest is White House columnist with the hill newspaper [noise] now this is a a had a survey that was split into two parts one was about twelve hundred respondents nationwide another focused on roughly forty competitive house district with eight hundred and fifty responded\nIn both cases the pollsters initially asked responded about their voting intentions then posed a number of stark questions on contentious issues and asked if they're voting intentions had changed [noise]\nAnd the national poll and initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the ball on voters in competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge of less than a single presented void up to a five point advantage\nThe change came after hard edged questions which sought to portray Donald Trump as a disruptor of a state's sales status quo\nAnd the Democrats as the party of open borders the impeachment and the pillow see for example one question asked respondents whether they believe the U.S should have an open borders immigration policy or whether it's illegal immigration is just that illegal\nIn the national poll sixty five point three percent of respondents said the latter opposite moves closer to their view only twenty seven point five percent said the former [noise] now as a uh the notes on this poll continue the Democratic party does not favor open borders as that term is generally understood [noise]\nUh no that they simply favor no enforcement and then they would I suppose I look in one government or like Nancy Pelosi those all the time and say gee how did all those people get here anyway Nile Standage are our guests deceiving and the interesting thought\nI recall at the George W. Bush strategy an oath for against John Kerry and a rather than as the incumbent president rather than the reaching out so much his strategy in the closing days of that race a successful race of course for George W.

Republicans and Democrats\nIt's between Republican voters and the Republican Party I'm a Republican I Love Donald Trump and I feel betrayed by the Republican Party and that is why Donald Trump was able to steal the Republican Party\nFrom the Republican nomination from the Republican establishment we had a trillion dollar deficit this year with a booming economy the Republicans campaigns on on fiscal responsibility they promise to defund Planned Parenthood and they did it why should people vote\nFor Republicans Donald Trump and all the good things in our country\nIs because of what Donald Trump has done it through executive action\nBut does he get only do so many things by executive action and he did get his tax cuts through a and there have been other things not as many as we would hope that I have to ask you one other thing Michael before I turn there's over ... miles damage if you are a deficit hawk as am I\nGood heavens Donald Trump has never said anything about the federal deficit reduction he's big on on reducing the or the trade deficit but on on the the whole notion you all back to the primaries are two years ago when when there were Seventeen Republicans running\nAnd Trump would be in the middle of the stage with his standing in the polls ... look to his left and they look to his right and you would say all these people are going to cut your entitlements but not me [noise]\nI mean as a as a deficit hawk I I'm rather surprised at that you are somewhat disappointed in the president\nI think he should have vetoed that on the bus spending bill I really do but the Republicans have a a responsibility to not live our country and bankruptcy and they're not doing that and again they promise to defund Planned Parenthood\nAnd there it's really disappointing and I think this is going to be like two thousand and six in some ways because they haven't delivered it really had that\nWill that will certainly help the president out a lot of a lot of people and I'm assuming you mark considering including yourself sit on your hands and allow the the demographic to take off as he's done about all he can do with executive orders your democratic take either house the Republican and that is to say the Trump agenda is effectively dead\nA and at least there's always hope there's always hope with the Republican control of guard was that you can get more things past like the tax cuts\nThat the one thing that would make me feel better and my congressman we come out and say I would I Will support a member of the Freedom Caucus like
