Neves assistant professor at the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York Dr dang good evening\nGood evening good to have you with us on the programs that every storm is ah is unique and one way or another your take on what we've seen of Michael [noise]\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten comments made by the Taj a regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can even think of hurricane sort of like elite and extreme and that is a you know the like the leaf is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that sort of a certain ... ah not moving very quickly what like Florence than there were certain linger over the place in a given period of time whereas\nA leaf in the movie industry and like um like Michael ... move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Florence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nIt's surely if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um\nA window overall uh area for a longer period of time and it has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall um but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow I pass\nBy sea so other words the the speed at which this storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's a land speed he's right not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins you know no it isn't\nVery good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six by both by four six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants of continue to move across a Georgia having a course of the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd he's still heading across the state of Georgia with our guest Dr Brian ... tang this\nDepartment in which you would teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they live at all these terms like\nWe all satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of us know what that is but it\nIt sounds like you folks were totally on touch a with a with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time I we used to make jokes about the weatherman and and how little they knew and compared with today I get to know how do you watch today\nWe act like you guys do everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and it it strikes me that there's a happy ballads there that that you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight and it's it's the nature of the beast that weather prediction will always be uncertain too to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come a very very long way and the ability to predict whether interpreting extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with a formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nA while and and land tick 'em we often times see these clusters of thunderstorms that form in the middle of Africa and they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tight\nOh South Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction of that oil for men to tropical depression [noise] usually in August September and October [noise]\nBy that time of year I Know there is a season but I'd never be a wide\n... that's when the water temperatures are to warm is in the tropical Atlantic um that's also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more for the most moist [noise]\nUm and that is also went and kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um [noise] that that sort of bring a storm winter storms that through our next door was over the winter that's when it's the furthest north [laughter]\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to far\nI have to maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a lot of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of of what this thing could do and I asked him if there's anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers at camp ... said yeah we can get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you've got all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nThat you could put a there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there [noise]\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites in space or take many many measurements are over the entire globe and out all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast a lot on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do as our computers get a more powerful and um we we sort of learn about the Amish are more and more um we definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked a bit at the tropical cycle information just by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the [laughter] [laughter] but now that then the other part of your research intensification okay for the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges a tropical psych on production that's something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly San like all we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong a tropical site found or [noise]\nUm so what sort of ... we we generally understand kind of ... feel with the fact that at that as as you as you said for kind of the war ocean waters that a light below the chalk low a boatload of hurricane\nAnd provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for the power to when is it a storm [noise]\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the ... the climate system itself has a A R there ah are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to ah the formation of a depression to [noise] to a storm due to hurricanes ah portions of the planet where are all else being equal but it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information [noise]\nYes there that are the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that form of the um acidic particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines [noise]\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons but you're just saying that there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael um [noise] uh you know a great number of them every year\nAnd that is another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes on the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the surface again psych flown it's yeah it's a sort of generic sites on the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere interesting\nAnd those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes the way which is why I and the science community we just referred to everything as a ... on a set of hurricane because that's just kind of it's generic name urban\nUp [noise] All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course ah either as a a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather uh and uh also any experience which you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or

I've been on a ... a very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day [noise]\nUm and so that's their choice to do that [noise]\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that ... I went through the entire thing I'd like to all of it so I mean I'm\nWell ... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that came with a little not to ...\nOr ... yeah you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area um tend to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and [noise]\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit there to event and then there'll be yet but I'm In the the there is always we always stress you know before the hurricane season began to plan you repair and emergency kit and ... and it's it's a ... like this where where um

previous caller a doctor tag and that is about our our\nPropensity for building in areas that frankly just are safe and I've often wondered about that I mean when you see a condo is virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean\nI mean you are just pure begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why why zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that we have this desire hey I'm On the ocean front well [noise]\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that that that that just foolish to this\nDay you touch on uh the important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed for and that [noise]\nUm you know where the terms of um [noise] how people managed or the risk and there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes have you heard an air fault line [noise]\nUm [noise] but in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance [laughter] I'm In the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through the federal program or a private company that offers sort of flood insurance and [noise]\nUm [noise] a sort of who you know ... for that that could ask people when when that that that risk is realize I'm is kind of a is a subject of rape debate um controversy [noise]\nAbsolutely it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be uh the changes in the in the house insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could it's\nA it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think um [noise] uh you\nKnow it's it's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to sort of crafting legislation on terms of um there there are caps on insurance premiums another sort of policies that they can put out there um take them at local local municipalities and and areas can put up zoning restrictions [noise]\nUm to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know one on one of the things that perhaps the incentivize\nPeople from voting really really high risk areas is that if they do it in that area they have to take on the forest themselves so they're not insured basically if you know they they lose their property um they they are owned or the costs of it\nIs the home of the Missouri tiger\n[noise] on the big

the fact is that we are all our economic beings to one extent or another and this is the kind of thing that can seriously affect your life\nThis talk to or not only our guest Jordan Goodman America's ... mad but to see but who goes in for medicine lodge Kansas good evening Steven\n[noise] good evening Jim\nA former member of the one night you know it's a\nVery for those who don't know it was even was in the same unit I was in in Vietnam but go ahead\nYeah but you are or suffer in\nIdaho I was I was actually enlisted also but anyway what do you have it for a while you have for our for our desks\nAbout gold it's so it's been for me a Seventy\nYear old and I [noise] uh it's\nAlways been colder value for me it's it's really a [noise] stayed the same or ... in the last year and I was wanting to know if ... if he\nWanting to know if [noise] or if he feels it's still a place to old are you [noise]\nI think of it as an insurance policy think I it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars an hour [noise]\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars now it's even lower them out so\nI I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and do this not throwing up it's just not what it used to be if anything they're going to become a new kind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't say go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same ... gone down dramatically a platinum this kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker rightly so none of the pressure smells overweight but during my they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add ... thanks for your service as well [noise]\nAbout ah [noise] this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in a certain times that gold another precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that [noise]\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so I uh go just doesn't during well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the fat reserves raised rates a lot have long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasuries now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum and let him\n[noise] but do you see the interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bomb or interest rates peak at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though it was about one and three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point too\nI think it's going higher let me just a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOn the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds none of that fire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month give us our called quantitative easing program\nThat's over that's what our for about a year and a half now\nAnd now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bonds come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing and letting them mature so true of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply gym that we've talked about this before but the deficit is that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in aid that just that corner around\nToday there are options of the thirty about the ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply and demand\nFields and fields go up and prices go down\nThere you go to the old a supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at a that gift that keeps on giving\nThe student loan indebtedness what

talked about one point five trillion credit cards over a trillion and car loans that that's up to about one point three trillion and those are just rising all the time of real proper\nRequires some

weren't GM Ford somebody going to buy a gym car wherever it may be\nAnd those when you get those rewards I tend to have higher interest rates if you were evolved balances on them and a lot of people

that risk um we all buy insurance\nHum the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through the federal program or a private company that offers sort of flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who pays for that that could strip the poll when when did that that risk is realize I'm is kind of a ... is a subject of rape debate um controversy\nAbsolutely ... do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be uh the changes in the in our insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's it's a it's a very very complex question um I I certainly think I'm a ... you know it's\nIt's really kind of up to how how the state and wants to sort of crafting legislation in terms of um there there are caps on insurance premiums and other sort of policies that they can put out there um take them at local local municipalities and and areas can put up zoning restrictions\nUm to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know one on one of the things that perhaps that the incentivize\nPeople from voting and really really high risk areas is that if they do in that area they have to take on the forest themselves so they're not insured basically if you know they they lose their property um they they own the costs of it [noise]", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city":
