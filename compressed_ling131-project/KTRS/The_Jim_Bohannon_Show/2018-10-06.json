to bipartisan consideration that used to the traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being harmed not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail

gone through what lessons do you think we should have learned\nI think the lesson that we are learning now is the importance of standing or ground I mean with with this president uh you know you add in back in a way that may be impasse administrations would have been cold\nAnd I think the Nicole the strategy of the ... had never thought that the Republicans would hold their ground and actually stay and from behind the nominee\nOr that the pressure would be so great that ah he would have been withdraw the or she would have with Charles himself and so in the face of these vicious attacks on them and as\nA stellar reputation had an amazing career as a a jurors to judge the lesson here is that uh we conservatives stood their ground and that right outcome was achieved and that needs to be a lesson moving forward to have courage\nAnd the convictions that our leadership and DC are dared represent\nIn reality can you foresee a time in let's say the next five or ten years when a a a major nominee like the Supreme Court nominee will be able to receive more than four or five votes from the other party\n\nI Hope we'll get there I I Do I think we'll get there quicker than that and\nMy my prediction is that actually the next Supreme Court justice will will get that kind of back to bipartisan consideration that used to the traditional with the Supreme Court and I'll tell you why\nIs I think with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to justice this takes in the last forty years of the Supreme Court being a toss up when it came to super judicial activism\nAnd that with this justice being in ... not that\nYou know the other side is always going to win but what's going to prevail is all the law the constitution and I think with that recognition you will see\nA less and hopefully and uh the last attempt to to hit the homerun cases to create brand new rights and brand do\nA protections that that were never intended by by our constitution and so\nWith the next justice band with is

strikes that's constitutional ... constitutional\nThere are an awful lot of people out there unfortunately\nWho don't really care how you get where you're going to the end justifies the means I don't care what the constitution it was only written by a bunch of dead old white guys and they all owned slaves in the center and so on\nA they don't care about that sort of thing and they care only about getting their way and if that means as I said earlier a lifetime tenured unelected legislators that's fine with them were not in many cases talking about very principled individuals' here\nWell that's

rejecting this idea that\nYou know every court case needs to be a policy victory how about we just have a court case that is correct all the law and that's what we expect to the bars\nWell I'm certainly with you uh of course if that were to happen we would probably need to do a certain extent to be teaching young people\nTo feel that way and then that's another area that I I wanted to get

University of Maryland is our guest and again you can follow him on Twitter at ... pm or I see I Am the numeral one we have a call from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon\nKen and professor ... thank you are very interesting man\nIn two thousand Fifteen University of Missouri was expanding build a new door or any moment was at every year they were growing and kicked out of anything keen with cats and they can't that's\nThe football team got involved the coach supported the football team the professor of journalism and is very has angry now school of journalism or dead\nThe professor of journalism try to prevent a stint reporter from actually reporting on the protests and tried manhandled him away from that protest show what has happened in the intervening years in enrollment is down thirty five for a sec at the end\nIn the intervening years is enrollment is down thirty five for a sec at the University of Missouri they're begging people to come to the football game they are begging people to support the college the university\nAnd the tax payers had said we don't want our kids coming to that school and learning that kind of behavior so we're not that let's send them there are the taxpayers can attack\nWhat both sides of the ... and I urge every taxpayer in this country\nStart a movement if you are I seen it on your university ... can gather band together and say we're not sending their kids there\nWas a boy\nIn the state university for most votes that's where they have to send their child to school\nBecause that's what they can afford private universities are very expensive and it and in terms of intolerance one way or another I I only I don't remember the details of Missouri I did at the time but you know some years have gone by so I don't want to comment on that particular problem with that particular incident\nA set of incidents as a however\nUh parents don't have options were when it comes to where their kids go to school it comes down to where they're admitted and what they can afford and often state universities do provide a you know and affordable way to send your child to school and you know if they're majoring in something engine like engineering\nWhere this nonsense says and go on and they get a very fine education\nUh sometimes better the private schools provide a but it really shouldn't matter whether it's a public institution or a private institution 'cause all institutions receive money\nFrom the federal government one way or another that's what title nine was in fact you have to get women you know you have to spend an equal amount of money a women's athletics uh you know or you don't get any federal money for any purpose well everybody told the line like Ninety nine percent because everybody's getting federal money that it wasn't just about athletics right\nWell I don't know that was correct to do that\nBut it wouldn't be correct to require\nA university to get federal money to provide a hospitable environments everyone but what happens when you get an Obama administration who basically tells schools to establish kangaroo kangaroo courts where there's an absence of adequate due process\nBasic protections for the accused to to deal with accusations of sexual assault\nOr you know we have to have a system that as robust enough to withstand an ideologue in the White House of one side or the other or we certainly don't want people enforcing conservative orthodoxy was things to do\nThis again institutions focused on preparing kids for the work place which is something all academics don't want to hear about it because it yet but the point is is that we have we have students with with lots of debt for them to colleges did not fulfill the promise\nApply to Raleigh and then they enroll people that couldn't possibly graduate they enrolled people into programs for which there is no real future they didn't find reasonable jobs they don't provide professional jobs you know about a third of college graduates I guess it is or under employed\nOr why not let the torch and you know if you if you schools the dormitories going up for auction would be enough to focus the mind and\nFinancial aid should be based strictly on the percentage of people in a given major graduates who are within one year's graduation are employed in that particular discipline and it wouldn't be like civil engineering in which you something like civil engineering where everybody just about gets a job by your again you're interested in literature\nAnd nobody's got a job there all the most literate briefed as with Starbucks and cut the suit made\nWell a a better alternative I think in a way to implement that how ... let me rephrase\nThat I mean most of these these these days are are federally subsidized loans and the sense that ... might not be formally subsidize but because they're made by the federal government which has borrowing authority of the federal government can it can offer them at lower rates for some day they have to be repaid right\nAnd just basically I Would require schools to finance fifty percent of the lows their students take out\nAnd to be the limited window let them evaluate who should get lows head of the students can't repay the loans then they're on the hook you say well aware of this school is going to get the money well the schools have got buildings right they could basically we wouldn't have gotten more your dues", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city":
