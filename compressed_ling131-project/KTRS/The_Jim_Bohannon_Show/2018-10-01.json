there are ways that you could become better at it and let's face it we deal with people [noise] that's pretty much what most of us who you might be a lighthouse keeper I suppose or or work at a a fire tower for the forestry department but mostly we deal with people knowing how to read them can be pretty important\nIt is our guest Dr data hills founder and president of sensory logic incorporated which has done consulting work for over fifty percent of the world's top one hundred companies these are certified facial coder\nWith seven us patents are good to have you with us denied Dan thank you and good to be here let's start with exactly what is a a facial coder certified or otherwise\nWell if you've never been lied to in life congratulations you are really lucky or you're not paying attention ah actions speak louder than words and the reality is there are about twenty three different muscle activities in the face that signal one or more\nIn different muscle activities in the face that signal one or more of the seven following emotions happiness surprise anger fear sadness discussed and contempt so there are reliable scientific ways to pick out how someone is feeling in the moment\nFor those who can you give me those are those again\nSure there's happiness the one truly positive emotion there surprise wishing kind of go good or bad you know I got new carpet Christmas I got a new car accident on the way home from work you can go either way a negative emotions anger real common fear\nSadness and then discussed and contempt which are kind of like first cousins\nThere he was your name [noise] All right now they're in a do does everybody react the same way I mean that's always to me was was the problem here I'm pretty sure that most people react in some way or another but I wasn't sure that the the everybody or the majority of people reacted in the same\nWay well these core emotions go across cultures I've seen them and young as nine months of age up well into every stage of life but we will react differently in different situations based on our personality in our kind of behavioral bent\nSo some people tend to score index really high and anger some people are smokers so it all depends on kind of ... the war and we have our personality\n[noise] the ah\nThe reaction of the people that I I sometimes I'll watch uh the uh the Texas hold 'em tournaments or TV or by the way if you've ever actually go out and play that folks are you'll find out that they don't show you the odds of the other hands winning in in real life for us\nJumbo head of shows you talk to Dr data here he is founder and president\nOf sensory logic incorporated their website is their name sensory logic dot com is the author of famous faces the coded a guidebook for reading others published by sensory logic and our number is one eight six six five oh jumbo\nWhat eight six six five oh five four six to six as we continue our discussion here on this evening with a look at just how you go about reading others\nUh okay I could think of let's say a over the eyes and the mouth I'm not sure what else I Would even know to look for although admittedly even if I knew where to look guys I wouldn't necessarily read it correctly but other other parts of the base besides the eyes of about\nA yes there are the eyebrows if they shoot up an outward are expressing surprise and fear\nI didn't know that crunches up is a sign of discuss something smells bad either literally or metaphorically so those are two very strong additional places to look\nA one eight six six five oh Jim bar number a we have a call and we are heard on the Internet by the way that we have a caller from Brazil Michael calls mellow Brazil hello Michael how are you\nPretty good pretty good at it and then here about three years now and\nI'm a volunteer and I uh uh ... ... ... and a English professor does figuring Russia and the school system of English you know because I'm an English teacher but I I decided to make a move but I came over here where I was the W what I our\nEvery day and if I'm awake at night because I wake up at four thirty minute time where are our head in the east coast time actually won the rooster crows around the corner from my house sure\nWell we're we're glad that we have you as a listener that does a radio station by the way in the\nIn Akron, Ohio which ah which Michael listens to I guess you might or might have heard our guests data hill note that the Brazilian seemed to have faces which are fairly easy to read that I Would imagine you must have an observation or two of your own to add to that\nOh I have plenty of observations over here they're not that easy to read the new number one\nIn my opinion um Brazilians are very friendly okay and I'm a very accommodating at that point\nAnd that was very agitated like anybody in any country when you're advocated area to read but people here are pretty friendly employ a fat guy I'm\nWith start working at a hotel here I met an Irishman is that right I think it was just like that but I remember coming about I guess at fault past President Nixon\nRight who was a right of course we had a show or whatever at that point but uh [noise] and it wasn't as parents well he was very noisy\nBut he was paranoid now with the press told everybody that he was afraid he was going to get treated the election\nWell there there was a certain amount of that I Would why would a graduate we're going to pretty much stick to the topic at hand there I think Michael and we appreciate your thoughts and your listenership is well my guess would be downhill\nThat are a lot of the ease of reading faces has to do with knowing what to look for so for example I might go to Brazil and or I might see a lot of expressive face was that I Would say they're very expressive faces but I wouldn't know\nAnd uh I might see a lot of expressive face was that I Would say they're very expressive faces but I wouldn't know what I was seeing ride\nYeah let's go back to happiness so at any expression essentials like a wave that gathers has a peak and let's go so when I look for when someone smiling and maybe initially maybe even perhaps superficially outgoing\nIs do they really feel it so they don't feel at several things can happen one is that the smile comes onto quickly it's what I call flash bulbs smile\nAnother one's a smile could drop away too quickly that's why I call I guillotine smile when someone's done with it had just gone and finally at the smile lingers too long even for the best joke if someone last for more than about three seconds\nThey're probably brown dosing you because in federal cutting terms thirty frames per second is Ninety frames and three seconds and\nThat's a really long duration for people to hold on to something so and I see an expression and maybe as the caller said you know they're superficial happiness\nAnd then they get agitated well anger is the second most common emotion after happiness so they have it in combination fairly often and I'm looking for the type of anger how intense as it is that the caller said they're agitated if the eyebrows pulled together to knitting together\nThat's mostly confusion concentration maybe a little bit of worry if the mouth ... lips pressed together a little bit well now there's probably a little bit of resistance to what you're saying but if they get a ball ... below the middle of the lower lip now there are steaming mad\nAnd so I look for those ... and different places in the face\nAnd so you know I if I can do this I'm I'm half your region there's a joke about the Norwegian American man who loved his wife so much he nearly told or so so I thought I'd if I Do this and are we joined Scandinavian culture I'm from Minnesota\nThen yes I can do it in a lot of places and in Minnesota if you live in an eyebrow that's the equivalent of nuclear war believing in Brazil they show a lot more than a raise eyebrows\nAnd ... All right to a job in Grand forks North Dakota although I had a show with our guest a certified facial ... down the hill and oh John welcome\nThank you so much in this fascinates me and I spent Thirty years of my life in sales and direct commission and now you talked to the region I grew up in northwest Minnesota so I can relate to Norway nations as funny um [noise]\nNow myself also held his body language it into what you're talking about because I can ... you know as\nI got more into the profession I'm someone sitting back in the chair somebody lean forward\nFarms and table some people arms folded were real indications of a older city back there and not all that interested to lean forward oh okay I think you're listening you know how does it does body letting\nYour bombshell body language as a as a let's ask our guest about that job Dana don't extend do you branch out into reading things besides faces\nI certainly have studied body language and I do things on national TV I'd been an analyst on presidential debates for instance for CNN and Fox and MSNBC I've been on the today show\nSo and that was on TV they're trying to help the viewer yes I'll branch out into body language but the reason I don't do it for my corporate clients is that they're simply more accuracy\nWith the facial coding and here's the reasons why one of his hand gestures and they are very IEDs in traffic and tied to cultures a hand gesture that's just fine in Belgium might get you killed in Sicily for instance\nOr the next thing is that the caller is correct or there are gross body signals that can indicate if they're receptive are closed off to you\nAnd they're probably fairly reliable\nBut scientists in this field would account that body language signals are about sixty percent accurate and that financial cutting signals are eighty percent plus so you know I like the higher percentage\nAnd the last thing is that body language gestures can be coached and because there are large gross movements you can kind of fake it\nAnyone who's ever watched their presidential debate a scene\nThat probably the speech coach told him to do this gesture or moving this way or leaning at this moment whereas again with the face of the only place in the body or the muscles attach right to the skin so it is the truest most immediate most in the moment barometer really defies the coach ...\nVery good are more to come with our guest Dr downhill is founder and president of sensory logic dot com is the author of famous spaces decoded published by sensory logic in subtitled a guidebook

statistics from a recent issue of National Geographic on line turns out I'm not quite sure how they got to the statistics about it is National Geographic's are inclined to believe apparently forty two percent of Americans typically tell up to five lies a day\nAnd another eleven percent of us actually exceed that intel over five lie today so it does happen with a great deal of frequency human beings essentially want to feel good about themselves and attract allies as a result the truth can be a casualty\nQuite often now do I pick up the incidences where I can tell something strange going on\nSo

I mean aren't\nI don't know I'm not sure I mean there's such as the divisions in this country that I think that this will shore up the base for the Democrats I I really do now we ought to keep in mind of course\nThat that doesn't mean the president's going to be removed from office there's no way in the world that there will be sixty seven votes in this new Senate to remove the president from office that isn't going to happen and Bill Clinton the Gore survived two full terms in office having been impeached but not convicted\nYou on the other president ever impeached Andrew Johnson he served about his full term\nIn the White House oh no president has ever been removed from office the only one who would have been was Richard Nixon and of course he crudely resigned before that fact could be proven\nBut I guess it's an embarrassment that the Democrats should hang around his neck and I do think that they would pay any penalty at all I think they would they would pay dividends among the increasingly rabbit democratic electorate David\nHurry ordering from space clap government waiters opener finance and time in our times there are ... times\nOr are they continually try to each other and are continuing artist asphalt it gives him is greatest talking twenty twenty or so before you ask or if they're saying these are a lot you know we will open a Saturn\n...

G. All right\nI'm just curious what are the odds at the moment and granted these things can change between now and the electric some major develop may occur could be a major conflict somewhere in the world the economy could take a sharp up during the downturn all kinds of factors could intervene but as of right now\nWhat are the odds that the Democrats will let let's let's do the three ... take the house\nTakes US Senate or take both [noise]\nSo the Democratic or in your house and Senate are ready to order start are just old up yards to act as they do move around all day all of that out a lot to do with a raiders of getting a little bit worried about the risk that we're taking\nA because I've been favoring Republicans the group or so we've been dealing plus morning all the Democrats what's our news or if you're a hunter go back a hundred and ten a you'll you know received two hundred and back at your account\nOr as a favorite or negative Ronnie ... you would have to bet a hundred and ten dollars toward that hundred so it would have to risk more\nTo win the hundred on the Democrats right now but as soon as this caller but I call my guidance outlook but the odds back to the way I Want I Want people getting all the Democrats\nAnd give them your stand boy you're talking now about a a business decision you're not talking about any any personal or a political or ideological views you're talking about what is best for your company right\nWell and you know a little bit of my personal views might play into that but in the end of the odds are fire fit it in my opinion is that the Republicans will take both the house with the Senate\nAh what is that in mind I Want to make it attractive for that all the Democrats are on these tests were taking up to a thousand dollars per person as the money is coming and extremely out you know the Democrats were advertising that will pay it out if they do it\nHas so that's it says let's say a company decision because it is up to me that make us the best possible and in my mind is to get people betting on the Democrats\nBut your view that is to say your view as one who makes a living setting odds of what will happen not to you or your hope for outcome or anything of that nature but objectively as you can look at it as you believe that the Republicans will regain control of both houses of Congress is that correct\nThat's correct I mean I'm a little bit cynical or the person uh the news is very one sided shall we say\nUh you know the other things that Democrats good as that and the latest Republican voter base for more than anything else other than the loan I Believe we'll get an hour ...\nEven though they're confident that it's going to happen I Believe that just\nPeople saying that the Democrats are shoe and uh which is definitely the the chatter around right now all get Republicans voting that we'll see uh the exact same situation where you had to sixty and a lot of hope for a democratic they treat you know there's also\nOf course there are also the traditional fact\nThat as a group or Republicans that have to say that people are for me a Republican electorate simply tended\nTo devote more and it's also a fact that since ah Eighteen to Twenty one year olds got the vote they have been in every single election the age demographic least likely to cast a ballot I I can remember the first time I voted\nAnd I did so I felt the greatly empowered I mean I thought it was really big deal I suppose that the uh the only thing it did the live here in my life of an age related bases that that exceeded\nMy right to vote was when I got my driver's license and and uh it looking at another thing you you look at a a bronco by by man who was capable of winning the presidency twice\nAnd yet when Obama ask people to vote but he wasn't on the ballot they abandoned the big time twenty or twenty ... he wins the election\nIn time like a ... a he wins the election twenty tan says please vote democratic and the uh the Tea Party revolution occurred Tony twelve and Obama wins reelection name is on the ballot twenty four to end his name is not on the ballot this time Republicans keep the house and they take the Senate\nSo it remains to be seen I guess David do whether or not a a Donald Trump has any more coat tails and block Obama had because he Obama didn't have very good coat tails\nLowered or Obama haircut demographic ordered out at work is a ... would they be going out to vote for our old white woman [noise]\nThey'd have to they have their they tended to vote for Barack Obama they they they ... they could be an old white woman who was as a as liberal as good possibly be in tune with a with their viewpoints and into an with those abroad go bomb a as a group I Would say that uh\nProbably they would be less likely to vote for someone older or wider\nThat that's been their track record up till now we'll see we'll see if other factors change that but that's been their track record\n[laughter] I mean Obama's kind of a yardstick here as he was hugely popular a similar politically I as a person\nSo he had that sort of charisma where even if you're a Republican probably like that as a man maybe not as a politician but as a man you had to almost perspective I don't see that translating over to class and\nUpper this way I I think the the bronco Obama probably would have been that entertaining gas donate\nA a a Saturday afternoon a patio barbecue provides you kept it off of politics so that he didn't start preaching to you which I'm told he was a had a tendency to do but if you just talk\nSmall talk things and the and sports and the like I gather he would have been a very personable companion now that that to me those are the kind of respect but it is really cannot say likeable individual absolutely I\nI I think that he was likeable and an effective communicator there are a lot of other aspects about him but I did not care for but yeah I'll give you that\nI mean we really saw him if he's talking about work Sunday barbecue I mean how many of us ...\nI was talking about worry as much as I Would if he got into his habit and I am told he has a habit I've not been around it I've never met the man\nBut then once you get up on politics he gets into a very preachy motive I'm riding anybody who disagrees with me was wrong I'm told him that his attractiveness of the human being even I Would bet your fellow liberals diminishes considerably\n... at the Manhattan\nIs why we are at St Louis yesterday\nOn ABC News\nI'm Richard Cantu\nFBI agents

and therefore perspective on what took place he is the former New York city police commissioner\nOr perspective on what took place he is the former New York city police commissioner and New York times best selling author Bernard carry it was written the grave above the grave published\nBy ... books are good to have you back on the ice Joe [noise]\nThis ah I was knowing just the other day let's assume that you needed to be probably about five years old really understand what was happening on nine eleven [noise]\nUh that means that anybody who is in college today except for adult students but the twenty two year olds and younger for those people nine eleven is as much his green book stuff as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln\nYou know you're exactly right you know unfortunately they don't\nThey don't discuss nine eleven and a as much as Abraham Lincoln are by far but uh and and you're right on the numbers are you know I have an Eighteen year old daughter that I actually just dropped off at Michigan State university two weeks ago and she was only six months old when when the attack occurred so [noise]\nUm this generation coming into school now going into college even graduating college\nThey're not old enough to remember so it should be taught and they should be uh they should learn a major substantial part of our history\nLooking back what lessons have we learned and what lessons should we have learned from the events of Seventeen years ago [noise]\nI think the most important lesson we did learn is that um it's twofold run your intelligence capabilities have to be as\n... as they can be in it and that's your local state and federal law enforcement communicating\nIn addition to your allies abroad uh you know in the areas where these people may come from it's essential that we are relationships there and we can gather intel and people coming into this country so that's\nThat's primarily number one number two um we've got to be prepared\nFor these types of dance a crisis whether it's a natural crisis or a man made crisis you know we still live was Seventeen years\nUh Bernard character that uh every sovereign nation should have this as a rational immigration policy a policy of letting in people who are whose presidents would be the best interest of this country\nYeah you know which end it's basic common sense it's exactly what you said in its basic common sense um why there are members of Congress that are against that\nI have I ever have a good assumption I strongly believe that the Democratic party is losing core anticipates losing a substantial amount of black voters and they're trying to do everything in their power to bring people and that they could show up in the communities and give them voting rights\nI think that's going to come down the line um but it's all about common sense and let people in that want to come here they believe in our our freedoms they believe in what this country's about they want to prosper in the country they want to be a benefit to the country those are the people we should let in\nLet's talk about your new book the grave above the grave that that's an intriguing titled what does that mean and don't you don't have to give away anything but just a bunch of age was for that title\nWell the ... in in my eyes look I Lived through what I call the number of counterterrorism measures here in Iraq for the U.S government but I also lived and worked in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for years and I work for the king of Jordan for five [laughter] so\nThe enemy that we faced on nine eleven I understand the idea of their history um why they want what they want to do what they do and uh primarily uh you know in their eyes if we don't worship their God the way they uh they believe they have a right to kill us\nAnd they would have liked to nominate relate to you know that element of our population so low that mess with the grade above the grape is\nInteresting of course not every Muslim obviously feels that way or there will be a terrorist attack every five minute or so you know\nListen listen you know I have a lot of Muslim friends including the king of Jordan who's at the Muslim a good man but he is also\nAdamantly opposed to the radical extremists which he called the laws of Islam and uh you know basically says they hijacked the Iran further on purpose\nYou know be a hero of your book the great above the grave is a Rick Raymond New York city police commissioner or to what extent is a ... really berny garrick\n[noise] um well the ... and there's a lot in there especially a lot of the things that are you\nIn their especially a lot of the things that are ... you would read it in the book about the Y. P. D.\nYou know I had fifty five thousand people that work for me forty one thousand that those were uniformed officers besides you know the terrorism and besides the major crises there's thousand things going on in the PCs office on the daily basis I tried to demonstrate that in the book so a lot of that\nCame out of metal a reflection of my time in that office\nIn terms of uh of the basic outline of the plot or what are we talking about again with without giving away anything but just set us up if you would for the grave above the grave\n[noise] were you ever you are the present day New York city police commissioner\nGlitch called to a shooting in or ... one of his cups or dead one severely injured and they say the ... ah terrorists investigation comes out of that but this is a guy that has had to live\nAfter September eleventh he was a captain in charge of the precincts where the towers were\nAnd his wife was killed on the eleven so he says set appealed it and now he's wound up in this investigation where it started all over again and it takes them all over the country and the end of the globe and it makes for quite a compelling story\nOnly six six five oh Jim bar number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Steve calls in from Columbus ohio for our guests Bernard Carrick author of the grave above the grave good evening Steve\nLeaving I'm Mr a Bernard a I got a question that Saudi airplanes were allowed to fly\nDuring nine eleven and a lot of access to the U.S why we're not other nationals allowed but only the Saudis were allowed\nI wasn't aware that there were exceptions made for the uh the banning of of air flights in this country is that true [noise]\nUm there were not flights that were banned from leaving a when the airports were often uh once the airports were opened a you know and that anybody could leave but\nI think what he's talking about\nIs a specific flight that was allowed to believe I Believe about a Boston I'm In it had a number of members of the royal family from Saudi Arabia on it [noise] uh and I don't recall now Seventeen years later I don't remember exactly what day that was but it was pretty close a\nThat was three or four days right after the attack of the towers um in that the authorization for the acts like leave 'em was given by Washington\nNow right now to the notion of what we need to be doing it now if you were in a position or maybe I don't know I'm a secretary of homeland security or what have you in a position to to have some considerable safe so uh what would you be changing about our approach to suggest\nSome foremost is the border to border controls border security um we have to have it secondly\nLike ice enforce the laws that are on the books you know you have all these people complain about ice all they're doing is enforcing federal law and the one thing I Would do\nUm and and it has not been done but these mayors and these governors in these political leaders that interfere with the federal government\nOr enforcing federal law the ... or the customs law I Would I Would lock them up uh I I Would not tolerate them interfering in stopping a members of the federal agents basically\nFrom doing their job uh I I it's wrong it's a crime it's against the law\nAnd if it was anybody else that was interfering\nHampering obstructing we'd lock them up\nOr they would win a religious or simply failing to cooperate and I I certainly don't agree with the division actuary city\nIt's there is both a crime if you fail if the federal government it's ice wants to know where somebody is and they get released in and I'm not a serious pedigree questions that you would\nGive to a local law enforcement agency you are required by law by federal law to provide that information and these people are doing it in fact they turn around and they deceived and they live in a in all this other stuff it's a crime and they should be held accountable\nIt ought to be in at the very least if they're not held accountable that way than they should be denied a federal money highway money education money or what have you absolutely agree yeah um the routine and we go through in airports if you could change that would you\n[noise] um\nWell the one thing I Would do is you know you probably have Seventy Seventy percent sixty Seventy percent of your airline travelers in the United states\nThey are business travelers they're travelers that are in and out of airports\nMaybe two or three times a week they did that's their job it's it's a part of their job [noise] I don't think we have to screen these people the way they do every single time that you know is that are as from other countries perhaps but I I just thought I think we we all do it\nYou know sometimes we we over punish 'em when we shouldn't be and that's one of the times I think we're throwing it\nFair enough again do we get Bernard carry for being with us tonight the former New York city police commissioner\nIn New York Times best selling author with many thoughts regarding nine eleven which of course he remembers most vividly big right on the front lines\nOf that terrible day and he has now

bad feelings are developing as the civil war approach to the uh\nThat spilled over at the clearly some of this behavior but it wasn't just the uh the the ... civil war that helped but there was just a general national attitude of his first and to think about it later\nA joined Freeman are just be\nA professor of history and American studies at Yale University who's written the book the field of blood we talked about the famous painting of Charles ... about the the fatal do all the only one of its type but you filed where there are other incidents of note that the you uncovered in putting together the field of blood\nThere were I mean for one thing that the most obvious thing though was just the amount of violence because um I don't\nKnow anything about this before knowing discovered it before until I was just to stand as anyone else when I started uncovering all the evidence but yeah there are a number of incidents in the book that are kind of shocking um there's one that takes place in the Eighteen forties\nFor example that I think is probably the greatest display of firepower on the floor of the house\nAnd in that particular case there is a congressman from Ohio named Josh ... getting she's getting an anti slavery speech and he's an aggressive anti slavery advocate and as he's seeking a fellow from Louisiana named John ... often stands out to the kind of position himself in front of getting\nAnd pulled his gun and Cox it\nAnd I've seen them into that a couple of other southerners\nCome over and stand by his side and they're all armed as well and it seems that there are a number of weeks or anti slavery advocates who come and stand by the side of getting\nBecause they don't want him to be scanning their alone and so at least for\nA few minutes in the middle of this speech you have six seven guy standing there many of them are armed and it's sort of showdown now in the air in this case nothing happens and the first fellow Dawson thought better of it he sits down and everybody else it down but\nJust the idea that that happened and that it is the invisible for so long is is pretty shocking\nOn but then later and Eighteen fifty eight years I'm a big fight that even people at the ... as being really noteworthy and kind of shopping and in this case it when you at night sessions overnight\nThe or the kind of shocking and in this case it when you at night sessions overnight session so or late night sessions or in Congress\nInevitably something bad would happen because Congress men were tired and they were grouchy they probably were drinking over dinner and so the atmosphere was bad and in this case\nA if a teacher he ate so we're getting a really close to the civil war and there's a lot of relief powerful\nNorth versus south sentiment and there's a fellow named the wonderful my teacher training pollution grow from Pennsylvania who objects to something last standing amid a bunch of southern Democrats and a fellow from South Carolina\nI'm named Lawrence catch a\nConfrontation threatens them tells them you want to object to something go stand among your friends don't stand one guy friends at and ultimately a grows gets slugs kit and knocked him slash and as\nSoon as that happens this hoard of southerners rushes to that spot some of them a stencil plenty to break it up but most of them to join in and I see that\nTrans grow northern Republican comes streaming across the whole the whole ... of them jumping over desks and chairs to get\nTo their friend and ally as quickly as they can and you end up with this vast rumble in the space before the speaker's chair in the house of representatives with these guys punching each other throwing the tunes and you know I mean the real mass rumble which definitely there's a comic element to it but at the same people who are watching it\nSaid wow you know that wasn't like one congressman getting Iran and other congressman and pledging in North against self ... that was a group of armed northerners fighting a group of armed southerners in a pack that looked like a battle and in a sense it was\nWhile gunfight at the vigil budget avenue corral or else really a pretty remarkable stuff was there a\nMoment but could have been considered sort of a a a crossing the ruble God if you will of the uh the bishop priests age if you will love overly became most firing on Fort Sumter was already\nA bullet in Congress where uh people in retrospect did look back and say well that's what we really should have realized\nI actually\nDon't think so and I think that that's something valuable to think about I don't think there was the one crossing the line moment and I think nowadays that we talk about that sort of idea all the time do it wasn't\nI think it was a slow progression over time with things gradually getting worse until by the second half of the Eighteen sixties things will really violent and it was clear that it was a lot of\nEnormous hostility between north and south but there was no solution and and this was part of the challenge of writing the book the people who are in the country at that time in Congress at that time they are not assuming there was a civil war coming there assuming that whatever they're doing they're not\nGoing to be in trouble that in one way or another there'll be able to stave off trouble so now I don't

southern congressmen stand up and\nTo feed their states from the union by leaving Congress had to literally people in the galleries and people on the floor of the house and Senate are watching the unions\nAlmost as the southern congressmen stand up and leave and there is a moment than when one congressman stands up and says to the room the union is dissolved that's a clear\nLine in the sand on

the galleries were old and you're absolutely right this was like\nEntertainment value is you know you would go to Congress in ... the galleries partly to hear the debates and potentially maybe to see
