I don't think the American people are honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry\nWent ahead as if they use the healthcare system in the United states is similar to the legal system in the United states has lots of problems our legal system has lots of problems and the healthcare system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other

was that there were just a lot of ... going on in order to change again the injured advise the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that and I think this has been the strategy of the Democratic party who we look at ... you know ... terms looming\nWe have a series of candidates\nWho are posing\nAs something other than what they are\nYes we've been hearing a number of things about the people that are most notably a Christians assuming from Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri a quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least

'em really commercial um horror films\nAnd you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go and have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we review these things anymore you are the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading the future\nFor I was asked that question on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not because the way that we respond to story telling it how is muted it compared to the way that we respond to that in theaters\nSo for instance if you're watching a comedy\nAt home you might smirk that might have a smile cross your face but you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and so you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sit and watch things by herself [noise]\n\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent ... on the on the various a revenue streams of theaters for example or get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do\nNot think so they do\nI Do probably would get a kind of data but if you're showing a blockbuster movie at the theater bulls in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or the ... the the the bill producer get a cut of that are best for the money is\nOr just the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nNot that I'm aware of what you'd be where I Would like yeah yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't [noise] you know All right [noise] yeah\nUh in terms of of the\n... the creativity that that goes into a Hollywood productions it seems to be the some of the the highest concentrations of creativity leaves days go nuts it into the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies just seem so to me that some of the highest levels of creativity at least for\nFor a second of air time if you will go into music videos and commercials\n[laughter] you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite extensive\nCause for second on something like Star Wars and a very expensive ventures very expensive so it's really more I think about the facts as anything else to\nDo those Hollywood depend too much on affects how we don't have much in the way of star power in the script sucks but boy we've got the great ... computer graphic or a special effects here as long as you got to dust grill light and magic on your side can you sell the public anything\nNow he can't you can't sell it felt like anything I got to tell you [noise] consumers are so smart they are so smart which is why you know I started digging into the the data side of things is to is to understand the customers for and there was a day when you could just make I'm living in Vegas it [noise]\nUm this is probably more like twenty twenty ... Twenty years ago\nBut now people are smart ... they can they can kind of fell a bad movie and it's not that listen [noise] from what I've experienced and I and I had to pray at that kind of start with that because I think I'd I'd expect everything in it for every movie in Hollywood\nMovie script ever starts out to be a bad movie you know and they're all gone with the wind or Citizen Kane discharge [laughter]\nRight I mean and sometimes he might have a script they might have made it not totally confident but it turns out to be a phenomenal found\nSo you know but I I think people are are really smart and and you know I don't do we rely too much on special effects that some of our most successful movies and the ones that I personally the most proud of our movies like hidden figures\nFault in our stars there wasn't a single ... and special effects and any of those films [noise] um yeah Slumdog Millionaire it was the Academy Award winner for the studio and not a single effect [laughter] you know I I think there are a lot of effect certainly more than we've ever had um I I don't think there's room\nYou know for those films that doubt at least I Hope so because of our our best stories\nKid is an article of faith among the good people in this country that anything that comes out of Hollywood has automatic you'll you'll be left wing of politics preaching to the rest of his memory or disagree [noise]\nGuided preaching it doesn't feel like preaching to me um you know I don't think\nThat that is fully accurate I think that maybe some of the stories that come to us might might appear that way um you know it's funny I you know I sit in these ... every day and [noise]\nYeah I'm a girl from Oklahoma I grew up at his ... Senate Republican household [noise]\nUm but I can still enjoy a story\nWhether you know no matter what my political beliefs are or or not and I think that you know what I Would I just what breaks my
