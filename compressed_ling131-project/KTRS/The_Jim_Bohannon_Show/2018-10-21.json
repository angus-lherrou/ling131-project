as we have to explain why we fight really\nI think we do I think first of all the use of what Obama cooled leading from behind what he called strategic\nWhat Obama called leading from behind what he

particular portion of your book how the west won the Cold War without firing a shot for in fact that did occur and uh obviously or is it is the preferable way to win a war how did we do that and are they applicable lessons for today\n[noise]\n... absolutely so I had to redo that we\nWe didn't do very very effective counter propaganda so what we did is we we ... writes all lives on the lives of Soviet Union wherever they were and we demonstrate to the\nFact that you need to go into here and all that ideology so whether they're fools of presidents are calling the Soviet Union the evil empire where it it was his speech to the Brandenburg Gate\nHaving to go to the ... down this or whether it was the worker incredible organizations such as the active\nMeasures working group investigating the propaganda products of the Soviet Union Radio Free Europe right you'll live with the the voice of America we we we were heavily engaged in the war of ideas that this has been one of the failings of our response to September eleventh we become\nThe most powerful nation in the world scene and we are able to kill terrorists\nOnce we locate them with with with almost impunity but at the end of the day if you kill a terrorist and eleven or twelve people volunteer to replace him to the very next day you are creating as an endless cycle and it becomes a practice of local whack a mole so\nIn the in the in why we fight I talk about how the cold all provides us a Saturday very powerful case study a model for how you\nDeal it ... is an evil ideology and that for me is the next phase in a war against organizations like al ... an ISIS\nLet's turn to Joe in Greensboro North Carolina all the jumbo had a job with Dr Sebastian Gorka the author of why we fight pillow Joe on science\nOr we need to know our allies and they'll react to some standards I found that with that for years we support dictators like saw the Egypt\nIsrael occupied Palestinian say which part all these people are doing wrong so does the whole\nAnd we had no standards ... allies but hey we gotta look we want democracy in the world we want to like us or the free country like hey you're associated with us\nWell first of all to ... to a equate to Israel or the other nations you mentioned would be way off base let's not forget that Israel is not threatening to push the Palestinians into the sea that's number one and number two up\nQuite frankly a doctor ... hour for my view than you can offer yours as I said before I Am not happy with the way the world is but I Will deal with it as it is and I recognize the fact that dealing with it as it is means that in many cases our choices are not between good and bad\nThey are between bad and worse and if so I and like any other rational person will choose bad over worse that would be my answer to Joe what about yours\n[noise] yeah I Am stunned by the\nPolls that were gassing to federal um Israel in a way of countries if this doesn't cause craters ships as early as the only democracy in the middle east it is the free as nation in the middle east is most important ally of the nation that for\nDecades has been surrounded by those who wish to destroy it and they don't occupied Palestine there is no such thing as time goes by the other day but it's a fiction so yes\nSo you voted for and politics and strategy is subsumed\nOn the politics politics is the author of the possible loved the optics the idea of you do not make the perfect the enemy of the good so sometimes you have to choose a lesser evil than I can tell you\nHaving met the head of state of Egypt

critters\nKilling people almost every day in the Sinai so I understand that the\nBreakfast people have the guts to back involved but the other parts of the world but we have interests and sometimes

trusted authorities on national security strategy and counter terrorism\nA former deputy assistant to the president is lectured for us special operations command the FBI counter terrorism division and the Green Berets he is briefed among others the CIA the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating jihad the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of ... objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling your call this in the cabinet or hearing the Democrat said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nShows the truth when talking about that testimony from ... to fold so telling the truth\nIs no such thing as her truth either the truth or there isn't true so yes this is\nThis is what do you get this is post modern lives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics will be divided into two groups those who believe there is truth\nAnd those that believe everything is relative but those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twenty twenty first century\nBut what if I put forward a subjective truth\nThat says that ah every single member of the Democratic party is actually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states\nI mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but what I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my subjective truth\nWas wrong but there's there's right\n... you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truthful multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically\nTo deny your accusations so this is this is absurd and feel of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon\nThat you could use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean the the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice or if\nIf it's a Muslim who's living in America a band or behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's no problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh show or elsewhere\n... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land ... such as I gather it's dog than we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes\nThese things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements or a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country who we are actually talk about\nWhat they've been has bothered me a great\nWhich country and who we are actually talk about\nWhat they did his bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left\nUh pushing harder and harder to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\nYeah it's a very good question I Am disturbed that in the upcoming mid ...\nShow the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist a at a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed and then they will socialism communism so yeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party\nHave managed to socialize this word and make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to add this it seems to me that what we are getting\nIs nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations advocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the collegiate faculty level in many cases have\nAn absolute axe to grind and very anti American ideology you are or less and less likely to drive even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty\nWho are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor of presidents of these universities about been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America and demanded to know why such and such and such and such is inspired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n... I I couldn't agree more we abdicated the schools the high schools and colleges\nStarting in the Nineteen seventies and that's where we are today so if you want to understand how somebody as a as as as dangerous as Bernie Saunders becomes popular in America it's because we allowed the education system to be taken over by the radicals\nTo David in Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job with Dr Sebastian Gorka hello David\nHell of a chance okay you guys mentioned earlier that there is a subject that is true it's true\nThat is it is claimed that there is such that as such we both repudiate the idea but go ahead well\nThat still just an opinion no matter how you know no matter how logical or no matter how uh how much feeling if any choice which has followed a difference between the two is failing logic\nBut that can generate a cell that is that that might be a big difference\nAnd it's just oh shit show he'll be getting rid of subject that jak stuffed shirts and go in school and the first place\nIn the air than at the Manhattan\n...

America\n[noise]\n\n\nOf\nActivists have showed one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we talk with Bill O'Reilly his latest in the killing series killing the ss\nCo written with Martin do guard is already working its way up to the top of the best seller lists and there were going to look a bit of just what this book reveals because like most of the things that bill is ... you look at the title just say oh well I Know about that\nAnd what it usually is the case is you know some of the things about that so the first broad picture of the other World War two Nazi Germany is collapsing\nAnd the rats are fleeing the sinking ship that much we know what I did not realize until ah killing the ss came along bill was the extent to which some of these people\nHave help from the United states government\nSure um after Iraq killing Patton which I became an enormous salary a lot of material left over because pat and\nWas an occupier in southern Germany before he was a killer met his death in the hospital in Germany and the prevailing wisdom from patent and many other a powerful people in the U.S government was we got to use these captured Nazis\nTo spy and work against the Soviet Union\nWhich is moving in and wants to conquer a Europe\nAnd you'll remember him from killing patent battle want to actually fight them he wanted to fight style and yeah so that's what the new CIA that took over from the judge did\nThey enlisted a lot of these uh ss people and get shop oh people\nTo spy against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union and they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... says one of the most of our human beings have it off the planet\nCalled Odessa and family knew about a year a before the third Reich collapsed\nAnd we knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose him with the way he can negotiate a separate piece is kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed this organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of its fashions within the organization and so they help these guys get out of Germany and we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the American not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them or elements of the Vatican helped them and they got them from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain South America and South Africa [noise]\nAh it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out we're talking big guys and we took it Eichmann andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Marty woman\nWho the ... died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work so compelling compelling a story almost on every page [noise]\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim ... says people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nWorld War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the debt said go on a cap\nAnd ... and ran a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people who just ordinary people it's just amazing I'm ... and when you read it people that all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a raise their eyebrows right now the thought of that I certainly understand that the motivation [noise]\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two and certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification for whatever intelligence these people may have revealed\nTo justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo but it's another case of people looking away from evil that's what Harry Truman did ill and killing the assets we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black males\nTo go after it off Eichmann it they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who does that mean\nThat forced forced Truman to do it\nWho who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that have tremendous inside the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge or an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened to the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people\nKnew it but he couldn't salad or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWhite six six five oh jumbo or number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of

A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boy so went out and beat up everybody pose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics or like the same same thing but in America a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nAre you a lot of them do yeah yeah\nSo I'll tell you a quick break come back with more from a Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

times so I mean you have to go back to kill a\nAnd Django scar on a nice people um to to see how badly this evil um took\nRoot and eventually killed more than fifty million in Europe alone\nAnd and so when the war was over the prevailing sense was relief\nWe're glad it's over and we don't want to relive it even the Nuremberg trials and and the um the action that was taken a lot of people turned away they just didn't want to hear it anymore and a lot of people in Israel did the same thing they didn't want to be reminded of it\nPeople in Israel did the same thing they didn't want to be reminded of it\nThey didn't want to be reminded of Israeli government [noise] their main thing was protecting themselves against the Arabs and they didn't want to put resources into finding I met him

this is what happened and it distresses me that younger Americans have no blanket include\nGender and how much they ...\nShould in school it's not discussed to this is what happened and this is evil and the reason it happened is it because most Germans looked\nWay that they could have stopped it they chose not to\nBecause they look away and here in America we have a rise any evil we people walking into schools gunning down students we have thousands of people being shot in Chicago by drug gangs we have co molesting kids that evil\nYes and he's a word that the that needs to be used to uh

latest work is a politically incorrect feminist it was ... by St Martin's press\nLooking at uh the circumstances of the Supreme Court today we reached the point where you could look at almost any

predictability about how it given justice will vote on an issue do you think that's a a good or bad\nBad each one as we all should should be thinking quite independently and not\nA ideologically and not as part of our herd mentality of any kind that's a God given genius that we can be different and one of my sorrow says that the intellectual life with the academic life\nHas turned into the sound of one left hand clapping and no tolerance for diversity intellectual diversity is a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity but what about thinking to yourself\nWell why don't you that I don't think thinking for yourself is encouraged in fact I Would have to ask you as a person who again but the germ legendary is a is a thrown about to do casually I think these days but to to call you a legendary been the leader would be accurate and now you ...\nBe for the call you a legendary been\nThe leader would be accurate and now you've written biz politically incorrect venomous my guest is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\n[noise] well I think I Will but I have written on the books and I've taken hates them I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred and the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left or from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world and I took heat\nAnd then I wrote a book called the death of feminism where I look at the failure of women's studies which became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues forgotten\nAnd our feminists knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we in the early Nineteen seventies and speak out on rape condemned it we worked on legislation we set up a rape crisis hotlines we changed how police handled it\nTo some great extent but all of this was not taught in the universities knows all work on domestic a woman battering or incest taught\nSexual harassment in Nineteen Seventy five Linda Farley coined the phrase\nAnd she published a book about it in Nineteen Seventy eight and then Catherine McKinnon did so in Nineteen Seventy nine I Will bet you a lot of money that the women's studies major is at the ivy league college don't know that this\nThat would be tragic if true looking at the landscape it's out there today or in terms of the laws on the book and in terms of a fourth one of those laws where is the biggest problem in terms\nOf this whole issue of sexual harassment and assault the laws or the enforcement\nGod that's a good question\nWhat we've seen for the last year and today is the one year anniversary of exposing Harvey Weinstein is the exposure of\nBig name in Hollywood men entertainment meant and so on we haven't seen any exposure of men who work in a lettuce fields or who are the the shop performing in factories who are known to us and who are protected by their unions we haven't heard\nAbout what they've done and even if an allegation is broil it what happens is the woman\nIs not believed she's believed she's fired\nShe's a whistle blower and she may have to wait five to ten years for some sort of redress\nWhich is why women even though there's an app me too movement that is a global and so many languages I don't know how to reach us all the women in Pakistan or turkey or Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia expect but are they going to get\nIn line thing I mean in many parts of the world and let's just come out and saying in many parts of the world\nThe predominant viewpoint is the all the we've just described it is not a crime or even a problem the way it is women are as very or their property and they are to be treated badly I mean and there are people who will\nNot only defend that we would but with righteous indignation no I don't I don't think there's any hope for people in those societies for the foreseeable future am I just a pessimist\nNo no I think you are real is that I think it's very important and very powerful that women that means barefoot women and women with education is both\nAre crying out to you have somebody like Malala Yousafzai you also got a Nobel Prize was shot in the head because she believed that girl should have an education\nWas mentioned\nPlaces where there is no hope and with the the ... is barbaric then women are also rising that's interesting\nAre you in all encouraged by uh the the steps however tempted than had been taken in Saudi Arabia such as allowing women to drive by allies standards they seem so so pathetic and yet and yet they are steps or do what extent are we to consider that as meaningful progress\nIt's a step I work in Nineteen Ninety with Saudi women who organized the first and drive in and they were put under house arrest for a year and they lost their jobs now\nThere's a little something that's going on and and in a society like that it has to come from the top\nYou know so it's not grassroots from beneath its new leader who says this is what we're going to have [noise] and that's well and good unless he's assassinated a because he has the power to do this that women are more an sales in Saudi Arabia they should I heard of that place [noise]\nUm there was a time in the Islamic world and I was lifting cobble I was I wrote an American bride and cobble about my captivity they're essentially a long time ago\nAnd there was a time when women were unveiled with the change dated or

career ... a lot of other groups needles just British Invasion and use it to the beach boys with the surfing and hot rod music well we didn't get all the notoriety because we never get drugs and we never were that\nOr is he never got in trouble we never were political we never got to go to\nThe waters weirdest three squeaky clean boys from next door that happened to go out there and do good show so it cuts in the media it was only\n... put stories out about that that boy so we were kind of others that rate are all these years\nAnd uh I I kind of like it that way because whenever we talk with some of the biggest entertainers we were ... a Jack Benny we took the Jack Denny lead toward with George Burns we toured with ... as well as doing a lot of his supporters and special and\nJackie Gleason dean Martin Jerry Lewis like we were in that realm we were kids doing rock and roll a being that boy so I I like the fact that we had a clean cut career and we're still very healthy still allowed to this day\nWell it certainly is it didn't just burn across the sky like a shooting star the letter men have had to stay in power and I was amazed to discover this but in fact it is next year but not until next year\nThat the Letterman will finally get what they have so long desert demand is a star of a Hollywood walk of fame you must be very proud\nOh my gosh you know for sure if that's a very thick\nOh oh my gosh you know\nAnd you have a survey that's a very big but it's in the\nIn our little [laughter] bit host of that it's a very prestigious thing to have millions of people visit Hollywood and millions of people take somebody who's sitting on the star of the favorite entertainer in the Hollywood Boulevard so it's it's yeah we are very very proud of it that the cheating that\nWell you certainly should be now I have to look at at this career this this uh this traveling around the country of the like don't you ever get tired of the tour\nAll the ways that you know I see people on television don't know Carson's show at the David Letterman show and there's the other day it's the talk and and they put their hands on this for ... oh my gosh it's so hard\nAnd they try to get pity for themselves I think they're trying to get pity for all the millions of dollars they're making that I always say if I'm On the road and getting up some occasionally at six AM after one of the four and catch a flight you know what I think at the alternative\nJim his shirt peach digging ditches\nA lot of that though it it really does now you have such a beautiful pure sound and yet you interact with an audience so well so I'm curious about this you've got the touring the live shows and you've got the recording studio and of course\nUh with the live show or you have that immediate spontaneous reaction but it's it's one take mistakes but all whereas in the recording studio wild granted\nA nobody's cheering but maybe they and our guy behind the window but but you could do take twenty eight if you need to to get a perfect and so I'm curious which do the Letterman prefer the studio perfection or the on the road lives spontaneity\nWell you know I probably the worst interview were in the world is if you eat in the world because on the very positive guy I don't look to the negative and they make so when it comes to a question like that might I answer is I prefer to vote\nBecause it does if you're in the studio for months at so and then you're on the road from it gives you that friday of seeing the country she in the world that yet being able to get in there and and just create jeopardy of your with your your friends in front of my microphone\nDo you guys have anything that approaches oh a a bucket list that you've done so much and you have received these honors an accolades and I'm just wondering if there's something out there that the letter but I haven't done the oh I don't know like a maybe a a Broadway musical or something but I'm just curious\n[noise] yeah you know those are always wonderful thing that was a it would be great to have like the ... of you know the four seasons have a Broadway show\nHere again because they were controversial which were very\n... off stage it did some things but [noise] yeah well I'll tell you what ... not really a gym 'cause she let me tell you one thing back in you know the first man on the moon Armstrong John Glen and on and the altar and well yeah a Armstrong his\nIt was a big fan of the letter and and his wife was a really big fan so when they won or lost to the moon whose interests and to the moon Armstrong he they have this little they weren't sure if\nThat does that work there and they had in their capsule they would choose the music that they wanted the here just in case he got spread it up there for a year in the capsule and they all have backed you're\nSo what happened was that he chose their heat at four Letterman touch with him and when he landed on the moon is spent the time on the middle and\nHe left his packet by the U.S flag us flagpole and when they came back after so back in ... was in Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine one one than the loan or he left a set a Letterman cuts on the moon so when we\nWere national act were international act and we're also ... intergalactic act\nSo not much more we can accomplish\nI dare say God and uh uh looking at the at
