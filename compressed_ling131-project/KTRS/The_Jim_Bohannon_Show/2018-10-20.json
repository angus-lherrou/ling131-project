a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWell Tuesday will be two weeks until the election we're getting very close to one of the more important midterm elections in recent memory and that we have the sort of take a look at it from a variety of angles and we thought we might take a look at it this evening\nFrom the standpoint of the largest uh rather fastest growing a voting bloc in the country one of the largest of such voting blocks the Latino vote and do so and the company of ... he is the founder and CEO of ... wealth management the good evening good to have you with us\nThanks for having return honor to be here\nThank you very much a first of all it is a a large group or or just in terms of of sheer numbers are there are about I think twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide they make up a twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and those are I Believe ... new highs right\nYou're absolutely but the funny thing is a lot of them are not ...\nWell that was another interesting and always a disappointing when you look at the segment of the population\nIt was another interesting and always a disappointing when you look at any segment of the population a and that is a but a midterm vote resent ... rates for Latinos Asians and wide ... record lows in probably fourteen\nThe Latino voter turnout rate in the mid term elections has declined steadily since twenty oh six and a that dropped into the fourteen to a record low twenty seven percent\nA white and Asian eligible voters also had record low turnout rate so although there was a record number of Latino voting six point eight million in the twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage that is a decidedly disappointing\nA given some a serious and contentious issues at stake why do you suppose that is\nSo you know it's funny Jim I equate the Latino vote\nKind of like a three headed monster there so many moving parts here so many different had you had the immigrants [noise]\nYou have the first and second generation has a well established generations here in the United states where the immigrants might warn way you know a can we get behind that you know and I can only speculate\nAnd can we get a behind the candidate that listens to us that may speak our language so although not a necessary component and\nIs it worth our time to go to the polls now I hate saying that you're them but it's absolutely true I can remember back in the days when I worked in the warehouse and they would pay us to go and could vote\nAnd as Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a duly admitted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats and Republicans for new jobs\nNew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nA lot [noise] of Kavanaugh\nLaw and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember is going to be an election of the caravan of you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new might bring caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S I Will\nSay I have caused the problem is like such an incredible autonomy I have so many\n\nWars flaws in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws to blame Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nYou know I'm willing to send a military to defend our southern border [noise]\nIllegal immigration on slot for Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge what changed the laws they like it\nTrump also taking it twin or with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThe leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again same without evidence this group of migrants are criminals\nDemocrats for their part accusing the president fear mongering\nThey also want there to be an immigration a challenge there was cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create or something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance trumpet in full campaign mode at the election season entered its final week\nPamela Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing of the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking today with the key lay low ratio of the real wealth management\nAnd looking at something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you dig ditches right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states\n... states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing in ... I'm not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission\nOr do you take exception to do any of that\nYou know I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue that we should be a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should\nBeyond immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it shouldn't be definitely more career and um that we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean I miss Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing all the way one might lead US government policy the created in most Thirteen\nOf course of course not\nFrom LA uh they they they certainly are and of course many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who wind up in other countries who who wind up\nAh entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back and it it it's just stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right and and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be confirmed by a nation state uh depending on what has been the best interest of the nation state but to call it a ride or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the lab that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh I think things are changing you know just uh my ... the earth or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn to you know it's more selective upon us\nOr a ... you are we are a warning for one in four ...\nPersons here in the United states are going to be Hispanic where do we like to acknowledge that are not the fleet or terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more uh sons and daughters are ... an average angle a family um but more importantly we used to terror policies that makes sense that are not cruel\nAnd that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr ended at a busy we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here in just a few minutes\nUh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who are let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up both separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response or frankly to those people is a it perhaps some would say harsh but this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a\nVery lengthy and sometimes they are Laden with red tape but a\nSoviet that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds and there was no illegal immigration John\nAnd I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but you know for\nLooking from the other side of the glass you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had I did a whole show on that and and uh ... ... is not exaggerating but that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long to proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles start having the dialogue started having this conversation\nNo one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy but we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this was not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this and the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population but obviously it is at issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the panoply of opinion here will be back in just a moment\nIt happens all the time you're driving down the highway and think there goes another one

evening bed\nYeah good evening I wanted to know what it would consider the difference between four thousand Italian immigrants showing up at Alice island\nIn Nineteen eight hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now is twenty eight so what will be the er at different ... says especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a sure they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nMonths at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time by or they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire ...\n[noise] that's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country and do so I Would even go further and say once your\nPopulation reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets it when you reached the point where there are a\nCertain number of beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat it has the obligation of the country to decide who should enter the country and how many based on what's in the

have no reason to believe he's anything other than candidates are complicated issue and I assume that what you here's what he thinks so go ahead\nOr the other thing is this is the things I hear as

because they try really hard to fit the America and I just don't believe that they were helping ourselves by trying to a debate that any of the Latino community in order to\nGet them into this country

terrorists but Russia's the largest country in the world that only has\nAn economy around the size of Texas says and they don't really have much ability to\nProject power it economically because of the reason I mean they do a lot of need natural resources that are having navy they can protect project power particularly but they have an incredible way of the I'm just looking around at\nOther

money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money\nOr would you do with the money it's so much money [noise]\nUh there was a a movie a few years back started to Richard Pryor and in order to to uh\nGet an heritage she had to spend a certain amount of money of the whole thing was about his efforts to extravagantly spend a certain amount of money which as as was pointed out\nIn that movie that was the whole premise for the picture or a admirably done of course by by Richard Pryor or that it's not as easy to spend money as you might think it is [noise] and uh I'm just curious what would you do with that kind of money that this thing about that I ... million set is to say [noise]\nYou could take a thousand people and give each of them a million dollars\nOr put another way you could take a million people give each of them of thousand dollars [noise] assuming that you got the ... billion that's uh\nThat's just an astounding amount of money I mean sure if

five oh five four six to six or Andrew in South Texas on the bull headed Joe Hi\nYou're taking the call I was actually given this a lot of talking to some are pretty foolproof plan for would be to get that all the ...\nSort of all of it tried to do that I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrews that you said all of it all that every tiny little trust the okay this\nIs the tax load then then I Would use that money you can borrow from your own trust and are just four point five billion in a not only comes properties\nAnd then with the money from those who pay that gets us given all the charities they give a billion service in real money plus interest and you've got ... five billion in properties yourself\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four four point five billion ... that's that's quite a rate of return they're\nTwenty percent down on a sore point five billion or the properties\nOkay well you've given us a lot of uh do you do play a mega millions were

from uh\nMy mortgage that I had planned way and I haven't been on so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first and then uh\nAlways had a dream car I owned it for about seven years and then I had a solid uh which was the addicts has generally so it's going to cost me about eight thousand to get\nA ... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am only guessing gym because short and now for five years or I guess that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure you're you're just a committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general leave the old dodge stops here on who you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars or a good it was the rest of\nIt I I I\nUh I got three kids and unfortunately a through the horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so uh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a\nNo kill shelter and instead of having volunteers run it to have it be something to where they're paid employees a man that's about all I can\nThink well very good okay neither the uh of course to me at the age of the three kids at six million to down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get a ... you're talking about to do a ... even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I Know the movie you're talking about I really enjoyed it and uh it's true you you just don't know how to go about ... kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound bonds and the like I I Would I Would be setting up my family forever and all I Would allow others to really truly blow a ton of bucks\nHonestly there aren't that many things that I really want to do\nI mean you know the travel the world [noise]\nOh I suppose if you could afford it I mean you know sure to give them some big vacations and then see a few places but I mean there's a lot of passion of mine a mansion ah [noise]\nIt's not a passion of my cars I mean you know most of the cars I Would want to buy would get me a\nSo I mean you know most of the cars I wouldn't want to buy\nWould get me a a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license in in rapid order I mean it would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler I'm not a big drinker anymore and uh\nIt would be tough for me to figure out what to do with it All right thanks very much Joe Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota next on the jumbo had a joke as we have now at a one billion dollar mega millions jackpot divided does so far as we speak they've not announced that there are in the winter is a good evening Carol\n...

I Am not one of those people [noise]\nUh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without that country's permission or do you uh take exception to any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I say that\nWe should have a better policy on immigration I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should be definitely more career and um\nThat we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries out a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries have\nWere created by us I mean I miss Thirteen there from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing although everyone lightly US government policy that created in most Thirteen\nOf course of course not from LA\nUh they they they certainly are and of course many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who were wind up in other countries who who wind up ah entering this country\nBut I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back into it it's stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration has a right and and at the time I remember saying no it is not a right you may argue that you would think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a rights but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state or depending on what isn't the best interest of the nation state but to call it a rights are simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nBut this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think\nThings are changing you know just a ... the\nHispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like ... turned left you know it's more reflective upon us\nOr a ... you are we are a warning for worn in for ... persons here in the United states are going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that are not if we don't terror policies that address\nThis coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters uh than an average angle a family um but more importantly we use to terror policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an opinion\nOr ended and advocacy we are are dealing and opinions will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank or that we would probably wind up separating\nThose parents from their children and my response or frankly to those people is a rap somewhat say harsh but this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a\nVery lengthy and sometimes they are Laden with red tape but a\nSoviet that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many\nYears uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds and there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point\nBut you know looking from the other side of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a show on that and and a lot of ... is not exaggerating but that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long to proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this and the the next half hour of the program with our guest is because we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm election as to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population are obviously it is at issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone how

eight hundred years ago or four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now is twenty eight so what will be the difference as as a specially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that uh my answer would be that are the ones who showed up at ... went through a process and they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a sure they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned or a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short\nMonths at best also it was not illegal to enter the country at that time they did not have the laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a different process entire gym\nThat's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once your population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets in when you reached the point where there are a\nA certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat it has the obligation of a country to decide who should enter the country and how many based and watched him the best interests of that country grad and you go back a century and a quarter\nMaybe say a century and a half and uh we had a burgeoning industrial machine that needed a it was very labor intensive needed a lot of bodies and we were trying to settle the lands of the of the Old West we needed a lot of warm bodies we don't need as many today\nWould you agree\n[noise] you know I think that we still
