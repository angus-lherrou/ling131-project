[noise]\n\nBack to juggle had a ... is our guest major Harris\nIs with us tonight CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book Mr Trump's wild ride published by all points books\nSubtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidency I Love the prologue here what I should have learned you lead off with this quote\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled quote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know that\nWe're right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nUh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\n[noise] who writes about American politics right now who\nComes across as a full blown no at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that an audience can feel and touch and relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional and experience\nAnd been around the track is I certainly have and you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability [noise] so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't alert or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read at I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart I deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I'd only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and asked myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you I\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of a major fantastic what is that about\nWell it was a press conference before rally in ... in Michigan for early August of twenty Fifteen so long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of\nReporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen any of his press conferences major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're a network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what is that those two words actually made and that sense as I say in the book\nOf adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\n... exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest is and and I say to myself there were all sorts of these great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me\nAnd it by taking more time in more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language I learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of practice lock\n... with all due respect to you and do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets\nAnd let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for it I don't know I mean let let's just do you look at the at the circumstances of this man I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but it's not even any other governmental leader and the other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf\nCourses jihad brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was completely different actor had different completely different instincts had orientation to the underlying rules of the game [noise] and I write early on in the book\nThat there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black [noise]\nAh that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie [noise]\nThose uptight parents who want to um school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lines you know that sort of thing and it's a while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're gonna have to pause on that note that when it come back we're they look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\n\nAre you looking to senior care for your mom

Obama when he was head of the defense intelligence agency as Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you don't really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information\nAnd yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember there was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\nOr to a major Garrett our guest Mr Trump's wild ride one eight six

Missouri tonight give good evening Patrick welcome to the program\n[noise] you know look I Want to thank thank a major Garrett or writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth [noise] but I really think that\nIf anybody takes a look at these bombings [noise] it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated for with this current corruption received a bomb\nAnd none of them went off and now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine investigating him and his running around trying to find out who said he mom's got sick and it

different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things on a day to day and our our bases and yes it's a high priority case\nBut the people who work at work those kinds of cases they don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes and one's in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work but what I think the caller's already indicate Jim ... is a sense of\nWhat is this really about and I would\nIm vote is a sense of\nWhat is this really about and I would I Would caution everyone in the audience and I say this all the time and we we have a an approach journalistically at CBS at that tries to live up to this sometimes you have to wait\nYou have to wait for the evidence they have to wait till you say what ... what what we know and then at the ten or twelve or Fifteen things we don't know guess what that's what we say we don't know\n[noise] during the chapter eight of your book good Trump's a Mr Jones wild ride of Saudi Arabia and the middle east and the particular Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince now that we of course have some later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that our listeners game from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not a unfair question and I would say this sense we do why [noise]\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't think it was in a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made what\nYou want to call on this and the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen they're likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump through the good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and fundamentally alter America's approach to the kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal\nAnd create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational to this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and\nA long time ago summer of last year\nWhen the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mine Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book\nYou don't find very many on the record lengthy conversations with Jared Kushner about any it's many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective is I I recommend the book to you because you could actually find out in Jared Kushner's words what they're trying to accomplish what their initial hopes were\nAs certainly the Jamal cause showcase brings many of those hopes and aspirations into a harsher and more difficult life\nBriefly or do you find the fact that this was his first foreign visit is to be significant\nI Do and that's why I devoted an entire chapter to it not that it's going to change everything are all the orientations that Trump brings to Middle Eastern policy you're going to be successful but they're ... they're dramatically different and there are different this key respect\nPresident Trump said there are Saudi Arabia in Riyadh were not can interfere with your internal

call ...\n... it's a full moon tonight but I'm really lean that are right now I'm just always for President Trump but here's what I my thoughts on it says how do you know it's not the Democrats doing this rally up to face to get him out so you don't know and it\nWe know that is what I'm saying now maybe it is and doing it to rally up their people to get him out the vote that because like where I live in the streets to I'm a I'm voting for a ... a cake and aid funds for many but one\nFrom the G ... finding they they don't like him a not a politician like Trump\nA way to say either and and and so the other candidate um eight thinks she's going to win but just like Trump won I think my candidates gone away and they're trying to rally up there ... that's what I say\nWell it is possible again we just don't know and that's a that's the sad part about it as not figuring it out to skip in Burlington, Vermont welcome\nTo Joe I'm fine thank you\nListen to the I heard general and the [noise] the packages were delivered [noise] now have cancellations on this dance [noise]\n... well the package that that was delivered to CNN was addressed to John Brennan first of all why would you send a package to CNN [noise]\nWhen it was supposed to go to John Brennan who's not hang around CNN secondly that package was delivered by a delivery service that is why the postage wasn't canceled okay then why did you put postage on it in the first place but there are a lot of unanswered questions here\nYou know I understand that if you wanted to draw attention to the Clinton thing you would put it through the mail\nI don't understand why why if you wanted to draw attention to the Clintons you would put it through the mail I miss you met\nWell because of the secret service\nThe secret service checks everything that sent to the Clintons crusts ready and and the same thing with the Obama detail\nYeah I understand that but that was saying is it the one that draws to whoever it is a is a Democrat is the only thing more than ... attention to it\nI I guess I'm missing why using a delivery service as opposed to the Mayo would draw more attention if you said a prominent person a pipe bomb you're going to draw attention\nI understand that but I think that a polar climate change if you want to draw attention to themselves they would put it through the mail there so the secret service would find it\nThe secret service and believe me any package that goes to the Clintons goes to the secret service trust me same thing with the Obamas any former president or they do not open their own male trust me on that skip a ... it it is always better by somebody else a gesture\n[noise] uh it it it is always vetted by somebody else a gesture and said ... West Virginia I had a show hello gesture\nAgain appreciate she gave me a cash to explain what I'm saying you know scary world that we live in you know that they should all have for us but a ... inch and shouldn't happen [noise]\nYou know you can look on the Internet you can make a bomb still matter what if somebody really wants to get Clinton or Obama who ever it may be\nHealed than any way possible they get that person don't matter what I mean he might have should charity he might have they do everything possible to detect and that they can only detect and for so long\nSo that's very true I don't have any security effort Jeff you're exactly right and these security effort is automatically a limited effort as the John Kennedy noted ironically just a a a couple of days before he was killed if somebody wants to kill the president badly enough\nAnd they're willing to lose their own life in the process\nThan the they they will succeed\nIn this particular case yes there are far far more efficient ways of actually targeting someone then they use a random and a and a ill advised bombs or perhaps even in Epley made bombs\nUh each so you're right this is not a very efficient way to go about actually killing someone it it is it does seem as though the action\nOf sending the bombs was more important than getting the targets I Would concur Gayle in Montrose, Colorado welcome

had shows I guess major Garrett is with us tonight\nWelcome back to just go ahead of shows I guess major Karen is with us tonight CBS News the White House correspondent to talk of his new book Mr Trump's\nWild ride published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams and occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidency I Love the prologue year what I should have learned you know with this quote [noise]\nMajor fantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled quote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you [laughter] so that's exactly right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo uh what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility 'cause I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as a full blown at all or as firing no at all it's going to have that core credibility that our audience can feel\nAnd touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate that you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional and experience\nAnd been around the track is I certainly have and you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability so that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentence that you just read that I don't want to give it all away but I'll give listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd said to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taking the time\nTo look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how is he coming at you\nI Would have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence\nAnd one example of it major fantastic what is that about well it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago [noise]\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of\nReporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen\nAny of his press conferences major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here you're network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic\nThat's Trump I should have learned to paid attention to what he was telling me what what did that those two words actually meet in the sense as I say in the book\nOf adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAdjunct evil exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the ... and I say to myself they're all sorts of these great clues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me\nAnd if I had taken more time in more\nCurious about this different kinds of political actor and has different ways of dealing with language I have learned a lot more than it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of practice lock\nWas all there or do you do all the other reporters now you've covered\nAh let's see for presidency for three news outlets\nYelled at let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for it I don't know does that mean let let's let's just do you look at the at the the circumstances of this man I I I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president but uh but it's not even any other governmental leader and the other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that\nHe is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics as we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric uh sponsored\nRadio editorials but he was not a fully formed\nBig time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf\nCourses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes and he was a completely different actor had different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game [noise]\nAnd I write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black [noise]\nUh that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie [noise]\nThose uptight parents who want to um school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents saying don't you know the rules why aren't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lions and that sort of thing and it's a great while to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's enjoying them and look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back with a look at how some other Republicans learned these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\n\nAre

when he was head of the defense intelligence agency as Michael Flynn thought you weren't being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn not you\nDon't really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember there was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the main as a valuable conversation\nOr to a major Garrett our guest Mr Trump's wild ride one eight six six

Missouri tonight give good evening Patrick into welcome to the program\nWe'll look a lot of things stay a major Garrett or writing such a good book and you know actually he needs somebody to tell the truth [noise] but I really think that if anybody takes a look at these bombings [noise] it's awful convenient that all the people that are being investigated\nOver this current corruption received a bomb and none of them went off\nAnd now the FBI almost completely stopped I Would imagine\nInvestigating them in his running around trying to find out who said he moms that they could and it happens right before the election plus to take the heat off the convoy coming up through Mexico\nThought well with our guest commented about to all of those various factors ... has momentarily [noise] I've taken a attention away from that the caravan but I can assure you that the caravan once it gets close to the U.S border we'll be right back front and center at and\nTry to gauge it'd be a genuine I think there was a long way away same time I think you can continue and it was doing go ahead\nSure and and the care of and it's going to remain a story and remember it's\nIt remains on its current course is not going to arrive if it ever does at the U.S border for weeks after the election there are a long long way away but the care of and is going to be a story that's not going away and\nAnd there are a long long way away but the government's going to be a story that's not going away and the FBI has lots of different\nParts of it agencies within the agency and it can and does\nI assure you walk chew gum and do a lot of other things far more complicated than those two things on a day to day in our our bases and yes it's a high priority case\nFor the people who work at work those kinds of cases they don't necessarily or even generally work government corruption cases it's not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes and one's in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency they will continue to work but what I think the caller is already indicate jumbo is a sense of\nWhat is this really about and I would I Would caution everyone in the audience and I say this all the time and we we have a an approach journalistically at CBS at that tries to live up to this sometimes you have to wait\nYou have to wait for the evidence and you have to wait don't say what ... what what we know and then at the ten or twelve or Fifteen things we don't know guess what that we said\nWe don't know [noise] a chapter eight of your book good Trump's a Mr Jones wild ride a Saudi Arabia and the middle east in particular Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince now that we of course
