sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page and a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WMBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically [noise] uh the ratings are terrible\nThe WNBA exists only because the NBA the gas ... male league has chosen to subsidize it any

about things that are upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant raw nerve ending\nIt and I I I think I could walk as some of these people that I could say a good morning and there is that what you mean by that I think\nIt's ... it's supposedly a liberal approach but it's more like a really\nReally a really conservative

C. where one eight six six five oh Jim bow and arrow because I'm from Dallas was evening you listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome ...\n... to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to live our fall\nHere he was spending that much experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've ... I've tried truck travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north and south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith on an on the freeways but then if you run into a situation where much of south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going to do go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you should you shouldn't start on the side roads and says it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just said to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh I'm In a state and then and then is that if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then the other side routes that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let let's see what I think overcast to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me and then they\nTell you that all the correct but in poorly you know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to watch those roads you should at least the civilian you're with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if you're in your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people that I meet up with you that you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those roads\nBut when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say he for let's say you're on a major artery and we are told that or the or has a place\nYou can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this leach we've gotta do to to this direction to that location so this way family members who rely on\nEven as the people on the other side cannot get that signal meaning that tax to the email that said was that sour turns on and the people on the other side\nYou get that connection your text or email all show up once in their ... their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call the ... and your thoughts your how does the GPS here ah affect all of this\nMakes everything so wonderful that we know where each others are like you said and activate your GPS for\nYour family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as like all the stars get thrown down you know can take our technology and\nYou know the stars get thrown down you know can\nTake our technology and if\nThe towers that evil that you're sending a signal to went down ... ...\n... dance single you all get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower active they will instantly they receive those messages so as long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and the other side\nIt's important to understand that they will always be there was a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens here\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio that good old ubiquitous over the radio always there and just er a viewership such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the boat had a show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the ... good evening Patrick\n... is a very very fascinating with hurricanes and so forth [noise] um [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script per a movie [noise] um why not just um uh [noise] uh [noise]\nHurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific and the new killer it would rain radioactive waste [noise] but they are getting well\nThat's a nuclear bomb to the games you didn't know because it involves a a a trigger that consists of uranium plutonium but beyond that if it it let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock the hurricane out of kilter I\nAm not sure about this but I Would say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes by\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other him practicalities of such an idea there is too big and very\nWell you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states less so let's say you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the store and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida liable for this storm and damaging to states the other states or let's say another kind of say let's say the United states there's a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight to the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to do some weights and the people that it hits it got to be upset\nYou know and I would no one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane and this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida [noise]\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left earning headed inland\nAnd the ... but he was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so a lot of the fact is that we just don't know enough about these things and and and the Anthony notes quite correctly up\nA lot of it just simply changes course in damages somebody else in the news liable and out of it could be a painful lesson in the liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will

[noise]\nI think of it as an insurance policy scary it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower the math so I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and gold has not gone up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that have been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a

might add thanks for your service as well [noise]\nAbout ah [noise] this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another precious metals will go up\nA but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times on some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these we got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when it looked like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so I Know goal just doesn't during well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms raised rates a loud and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that has all bad for gold silver and taught them and let him\nDo you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond bear market we basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peeking about fourteen percent of Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though is about more than three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not an empire for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month for the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's whatever for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening some when bombs come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing and letting them mature\nSo to the big buyers bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in aid that just that corner on today there are options of the thirty about in the nearby they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply best demands\nFields and we'll go up prices go down\nThere you go you'll to supply and demand thing All right we're going to go back and talk to some more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and terrorists and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving\nThe student
