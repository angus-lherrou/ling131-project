triggered\nIt's on liberty but it's a satire of big government\nAnd what triggered this um is the fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote\nAnd the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them and uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket\nBut they want a guarantee to the lock it in but they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that was Obamacare get the kids to enroll and look I'll become dependent on keep on\nVoting us in and um so that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came on line it didn't work\nOn a call or two thousand Thirteen\nAnd it didn't work for weeks or months he really still doesn't work and so a lot of these kids tried to enroll they couldn't and their response was you can't even create a website for ... for me to put my name in it and you want me to trust you with my health forget it\nIt's all the surveys including the Pew Research center at Harvard Institute of politics and now it's we're all on the

six six five oh five or six to six with our guest is David Thoreau founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and the Eighteen to Twenty one year old's the youngest of the of the young voters\nThat is the group which has consistently and legs in an election ouch\nNotch voted or they vote but the the least of any any age group in in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do when I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard\nBut ah it it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people that have an option of this country and if you don't use that that uh that franchise or if you exercise your franchise we have trouble and nobody likes of flabby franchise [noise]\nSee I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the [noise] the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nNow but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't get involved in the issues you don't register to vote I vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless I Know and\nPart of it also is the fact that they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history [noise] they don't understand the world they live in Florida\nThough I mean I Know and that ... and it is\nBecause the failure of the of the ... the school system [noise] um and that's when you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth [noise] um which I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is a reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on\nThe hook for them being the questions they were asking [noise] and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects ... so to speak and the uh the commanding heights of the culture and they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but [noise]\nUh in their case especially now millennials have left for college and are starting careers and families\nAnd so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this show there look they're now they're even more interested in in answers and practical way to get through that so [noise] uh that that was the motivation for [noise]\nA creating a serious and creating catalyst and so on [noise] so our our interest is to push this as far as we can [noise]\nUh we were talking before about on the view that many millennials are supporting socialism [noise] um and that people are Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you were you were pointing out correctly that\nThese countries are actually quite robust market based economy is\nAnd to give you an idea that percentage of\nOf ownership I'm In this country is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to say a country like China China is just slightly lower than in art in order to countries and then of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government [noise] so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give me a further idea if your rank the um [noise]\nThe levels of private wells [noise] um [noise] I'm like country or it turns out that Denmark has twelve Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth [noise]\nUm [noise] North Korea is at the bottom of a hundred and eighty is about the U.S is Eighteenth so the so the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about it we're going to come back and talk some more with David Thoreau is founder president and chief executive officer of the

example um ... have been taught\nThat the great recession in a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free markets\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government more in centered\nSo go ahead\nWell realize that these kinds of um [noise] like Conakry examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political authority is even more justified\nIt makes a huge difference in the receptive to the to the idea of\nLiberty looking back with more with our guests David Thoreau again the website independent dot org ... he is the founder

this country [noise]\nUh I had never heard of these programs I guess that's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcend the generations in this country that something like this could be happening\nI've long clips taken for granted for example David that if I stand in the supermarket checkout line that the uh the names that are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of them are anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell it is part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really [noise] ah I I wouldn't call it\nAnd so it's really uh I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly a outflank in the traditional media a it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around the hundred and ... million\nViews in the media and I'm John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love go than\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places and of course yourself are you taking the time it's something that is in the ... it's in the ascendant and I think that's the good news if if it was something that wasn't getting traction and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from bed in New York City who joins us now good evening bed see\nHow you doing guys I'm actually in New York City I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead [noise]\nI don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're going a little bit are there any age category here with the home with a millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\n'cause I grew up around people that you know where\nThe older generation that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X rays and and generation y which became a so called millennial so anybody that's an undergrad in college right now it's younger millennial according to the math that said that they'd be like Generation Z\nThat's right new one they're younger than that it was about twenty three by my youngest boy that would be at the ... the youngest of millennials that he's already graduated college and have the job so you're you're\nYou're absolutely right and you are a millennial you're actually um the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nAnd of course these categories are imprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them\nAnd that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger people as well so when we developed this this program the original seasoned lawyer was targeting primarily college age and through young adult\nI'm scared because the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial\nGroup to pass through the demography uh so I think that it's a it's a very much as a way you're describing on one thing I should also point out this goes back to the gym was mentioning\nAbout the uh cynicism about millennia ultimate it's also true with younger people as well\nThat ah even despite that um it turns out from very surveys that are about ... about forty two percent of young Americans including millennials support capitalism about thirty\nThirty three percent say they support socialism although most of them don't let socialism is\nUh surveys show that trust in the federal government is around twenty three percent um

founder president and chief executive officer of the independent Institute and publisher of the independent review David good evening at\nThe gym and let's start out by taking a look at a couple of projects that you have a a instituted here are the love God love and the catalyst what are these\nWell I'm a few years ago we created a video series on YouTube to target millennials loads of it's a satire of its on liberty but it's a satire of big government\nAnd what triggered this um is\nThe fact that millennials are voted overwhelmingly both times for Obama or as you said didn't vote and the basic view that they had was the government's going to take care of them and uh the Democrats' progressive and so forth believe they had this generation and their hip pocket\nBut they wanted a guarantee sort of lock it in that they keep on voting them an office and the way they're going to do that it was Obamacare get the kids to enroll and look become dependent on keep on voting us in\nAnd um so that was the plan but something happened on the way which they didn't expect which was you may remember that when the Obamacare website came on line it didn't work\nOn call or two thousand Thirteen\nAnd it didn't work for weeks or months he really still doesn't work and so a lot of these kids tried to enroll they couldn't and their response was you can't even create a website for ... for me to put my name in it and you want me to trust you with my health forget it\nIt's all the surveys including the Pew Research center a Harvard Institute of politics and now it's we're all on the same thing that that month the trust that millennials by and large had in Washington Obama an Obamacare crashed\nVery much so in fact we're go we're overdue for a break which we will take care of but we need to emphasize something the only way\nThat the Scandinavian countries could ever afford the extremely expensive cradle to grave kind of coverage that they have is by having road bust\nPrivate sectors that I mean private sectors that are are far more open and free of regulation than ours are I mean that's something that people don't realize that they think that this is just some giant\nA socialist a would be paradise well some of the programs were socialistic but the economy is very private sector or they couldn't afford it or we're going to come back and talk some more fascinating

ouch\nNotch voted a vote but do it at the least of any any age group in the country and for reasons that I've never understood I remember casting my first ballot\nAnd I felt a a sense of empowerment or I can do what I got my driver's license which of course is another area which many young people can identify with with me in that regard but a ... it's unfortunate because this is the method by which people have an option in this country and if you don't use that\nThat uh that franchise or if you'd be able to exercise your franchise we have troubles but nobody likes the flabby franchise\n[noise] see I think I think that's true um I Do think that this reflects the cynicism and powerless nature of their outlook\nNow but they make themselves powerless I Know you don't get involved you know what are the issues you don't register to vote you don't vote well whose fault is it that you're powerless I Know and\nPart of it also is the fact that they don't they don't have civic education they don't have access to education American history they don't understand the world they live at\nFort though I mean why did I Know and I said I ... and it is\nBecause of the failure of the ... of the the school system [noise] um and that's why you know that's another whole issue of you know the case for educational choice and so forth um which I think it is definitely in the ascendant but it it it is it reality and so\nThat's why we were focusing on\nThe hook for them being the questions they were asking and the fact that they were not willing to trust the usual suspects as I guy so to speak and the uh the commanding heights of the culture and they no longer trusted\nThe political elites which is sort of catching up with the rest of the country but [noise]\nUh in their case especially now millennials have left for college\nAnd are starting careers and families\nAnd so they have to buckle down and figure out you know how are they going to get through all this so they're looking for now they're even more interested in in the answers and practical way to get through that so [noise] ah that that was the motivation for\nA great in the series and creating catalyst and so on [noise]\nSo our our interest is to push this as far as we can\nUh we were talking before about uh the view that many millennials are supporting socialism [noise] um and that people like Bernie Sanders talked about the Nordic countries and you're you're pointing out correctly that\nThese countries are actually quite robust market based economy is\nAnd to give you an idea that percentage of\nOf ownership I'm In these countries is about Seventy five percent private of the wealth\nAnd if you compare that to a country like China China is just slightly lower than an art in order to countries and then of course is a very robust economy despite the problems with the government [noise] so um\nThe uh I think the opportunities are enormous and just give you a further idea if your rank the um [noise]\nThe levels of private wealth [noise] um [noise] um by country saw it turns out that Denmark is twelve Switzerland is for Norway is twenty third sweetness fifteenth [noise]\nUm [noise] North Korea is at the bottom of a hundred and eighty is about the U.S is Eighteenth for the for the U.S is lower than Denmark and Sweden\nWhich is a remarkable when you think about

example um ... have been taught\nThat the great recession and in a two thousand eight was caused by greed and the free markets [noise]\nAnd even though the reality of it is that the federal government created the recession because of the Community Reinvestment act that was started decades earlier that created a gigantic housing bubble and that was not sustainable it burst and of course the usual response was taken which was\nTo have government bail out the different firms that had gone off and took these high risk um investments which were essentially either mandated by the government more incentive by the government itself\nSo\nFor realize that these kinds of um [noise] like Conakry examples of allegedly the failure of free markets are fallacies and that their cynicism about political

reaching out I\nI consider myself to be reasonably well informed on what's happening in this this country [noise]\nUh I had never heard of these programs I guess it's a sign that maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just a sign of how stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that transcended generations in this country that something like this could be happening I've long clips taken for granted for example David that if I stand in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names that are splashed across the tabloids first names only that I don't know who any of the bar anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell if it's part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really uh I I wouldn't call it a subversive but it's it's certainly\nA outflank came the traditional media\nA it is it is true however that for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million\nViews in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love them\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places and of course yourself are you taking the time it's something that is in the ... it's in the ascendant and I think that's the good news if it was something that wasn't getting traction and I think we'd have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from bed in New York City who joins us now good evening Ben\nHow're you doing guys I'm actually not a New York city I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead [noise]\nI don't really have a question I just wanted to say that I think you're going a little bit under any age category here with the home with a millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like the higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\nBecause I grew up around people that you know where\nThe older generations that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X. and that generation y which became a so called millennial by anybody that's an undergrad in college right now it's younger millennial according to the map\nThat said they'd be like Generation Z that's right you're a new one younger than that it was about twenty three by my youngest brother would be at the ... the youngest of millennials that he's already graduated college and have the job so you're you're\nYou're absolutely right and you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half tier of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nAnd of course these categories are\nImprecise you know there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them\nAnd that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger people as well so when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and through young adult\nI'm fairly clear is the second season is primarily focused on early career is as the millennial\nGroup to pass through the demography uh so I think that it's a it's a very much as a way you're describing on one thing I should also point out this goes back to something that Jim was mentioning\nAbout the uh cynicism about millennia ultimate it's also true with younger people as well that ah even despite that um it turns out from birth surveys that are about\nIt's about forty two percent of young Americans including millennials support capitalism about thirty thirty three percent say they support socialism although most of them don't let socialism is\nUh surveys show that trust in the federal government
