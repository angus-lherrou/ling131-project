were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me let me expand upon that point [noise] I'm not saying that there was a ... cage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis of disdain\nThat is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain disrespect [noise]\nAnd I don't think the

can be done [noise] also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all [laughter]\nMaybe or do you use the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all the potential options that we have to make

very much and I appreciate it and is it real hot ... has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars

carriages go five states in their ... why are we sending money\nThere's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although\nAs I noted that suddenly Powell they may be useful on occasion is hardly a usefulness that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is a is a little hard to understand\nBut I don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different\nBut they are

consulate\nWouldn't just for ... for a look a certain level in there or did you do show\nUs that he's violated multiple Saudi laws Castro died in ... he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is there a story on age sex and the New York times [noise] again\nHe would be just as out of the way the and I think that uh again we have a a very rational bought process from Rick uh get it and less and less we really think go Sydney power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of big screen brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would eat another itself be or shall we say I'm a pleasant about faith to send a message to dissidents\n[laughter] well it certainly should have been but this is this you mentioned earlier gentleman that evil sort of regime and they are barbaric against women and all kinds of\nCitizens of their country so that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me that they have generally been\nPretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation they were supposed to do everything but ...\nYou know you know the ... that ended up ... this is a regime so brutal that they might very well think that that would somehow pass a oh okay you were only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that stupid Linda in champagne Illinois hello\nHi ... I'm not saying that says static government are nice\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they are\nCertainly not at that and this this fellow um

makes him a savory character that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to chat right in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and now ... says that\nUm [noise] and I honestly think that the government would have been so stupid it's ... like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even know what happened\nYou know we do but but I was thinking about this rogue elements like consulates consulates these are not just places like boutique sort of the shopping center where you just wander end but\nPeople can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John granted maybe on something and it meant and then the partly make Trump look bad and and make a ... you know because I\n... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you'll have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that have been fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on uh everybody on the left in the United states I mean that I don't see any gain here for the risk of\nHabit but I Will say that like before the election this isn't you know causing the administration headache\nWell it's going to be administration a minor league headache I mean let's face it let's just not this was not Iranian nuclear deal is is not a a lot of jobs than anything else I mean that although we're we're making a big deal out of it because people get all upset about it but I cannot believe frankly Linda\nThat the one tenth of one percent of the voters in this country are going to change their vote because of this\nWell I think that the industry is handling it very well but I Do think it's being blown way out of proportion

really ...\nUh what goes on between a sectarian groups a religious level\n[noise] uh okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel All right uh ... please please amplify further on that are obviously we're not talking about\nUh two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh to consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect and there's a new identity politics a political correctness\nAnd there's a new\nIdentity politics a political correctness and the like ah as being a mother a religious sect or this is a is grounded in which I'm not a perhaps a totally understanding what you're saying [noise]\nOkay well despite the fact that most of it is similar for probably very few individuals who don't ascribe to some degree of secular already a there are religious underpinnings to a secular thought and they do or fall\nIn line with the Judeo Christian ethic except it's in large measure breakdown of the ... Christian aspect of that\nCan you hear me\nYes you're on the radio go right ahead\nMy phone is I got a flip phone well okay for\nSure I don't consider myself ... fell ... percent but what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when president he did not want to ... them and I think that I felt\nThat\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter earning base it on\nAnd that way I see we don't need any cell otherwise\nUp on Capitol Hill so whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that up to me it's not it area the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for the for all we got to wait until after the election\nShow it on the other for for how to get elected\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before deferring to Dr Creighton\nIt was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions\nFactions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize\nTo try and convince others of their point of view it as an essential part of society ... be carried do far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that with the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility by defer to Dr Creighton\nHas to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ... leave for\nThe unified groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding traction is what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is the extremes polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nMartin has always enjoy your show who shake your says thank you when you get sort of point when you go to is\nThe restaurant or do you go out and so on I ... I don't know if the person who the establishment is left ... whatever the or I don't understand this really wants to who\nGets to a point where you can't go out and have reason to say without someone screaming at you spit you lose nothing and send things you can't [noise]\nI really don't care of or his positions\nJust let's say let's have a reason to bake them if we can talk to them screaming at each other for ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm I called the Clinton machine Clinton machine has his just use is to give up the fact\nThat two years ago two years ago [noise]\nYou know you lost the election of ... I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest [noise] then you're going to try to build it up to tear down\nAgain I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the boats Clinton's especially in regard to a uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nBut I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nThat is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics of the silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts referencing I\nYou shouldn't and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these\nPeople but that is a that is is the sad a problem and that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective that you are so few or that you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that he is out of bounds or you can let society it'd be reduced to ... to the level of but who can put together and more of violence on the street for you know\nI I think you're going to several important points or whatever the points I Try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's ... for some time now that is an increasing degree or\nA ... of the offices within the society and then the increasing decree of moral perfectionism obsession all drinking is society\nAs a result when when one morning count as those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to uh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and you place them on people around them\nA certain point you have a group like a ... a\nA claiming that the anti fascist and you look at the after it's very very obvious that that behavior is that if you're one would expect from the fascist group [noise]\nAnd so you see this kind of an accusation coming from the left projecting on the right for everything that they're doing\nA and and denying that are claiming that it's right to just doing it so that I think that motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are\nCurrently on the books a from a place like a Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting on the streets issues have to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the\nNecessary a legal sanctions and boundaries or a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah again it it it is not something that uh\nThat that could that could possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought a rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say that if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass are behaving like civilized beings and that is [laughter]\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that as it is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's ... yeah go ahead [noise]\nUh uh yeah absolutely but it it's the role of the week of then ah both at the local level and the federal law ultra forced the laws of the country [noise] and if they fail to do that you can expect a increasing outbursts or for these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly are we are at the G telling them yes you're tactic at intimidation is working and ah people respond\nPositively win or are they are told that ah their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated that stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology involved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing

uh [noise] highest is thinking that there seem to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least a portion of the population and\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plots were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nI mean let me expand upon that point [noise]\nI'm not saying that there was a may ... directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain disrespect [noise] and I don't think the president should go

response where they said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets to be headed during an entirely sure why aggressive as soon as I heard that I thought okay that what that means they tortured him to death\nI thoroughly agree on it have you\nAs a as if this was never happened anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not going to say what do you do about

would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that the I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and
