really good things away we started the game um\nThrough a momentum change within the game and then once we got some momentum hacker team role and did a lot of really good things about the course of the game and came away with a male fairly Andrew for injury free and and a great weekend preparation our guys are excited to have a chance to go play against the\nTeam lots of ground to cover looked through Memphis do for the first couple of seconds you jump out and you got exactly we talk about this on friday night how important was for something good to happen early for this team jump out to a Twenty one to nothing really\nI think it's really important then it was this last week for us to start fast and and you can talk about that man and you want to get it scripted that way but\nYou know eventually you got to step up and you're going to go make it happen and the challenge for our team was to go do that no wait for somebody else to to go do you mean the guy you'd be the want to go to a ... that he had to get it started in\nRio de three in al ... an interception then and then they often do their part [noise] huh so it was exactly how you want to start is now when you get in that position\nYou want to keep them there and and not allow it to come back to the way it was but I knew we were gets out of the out of Memphis that's kind of the way that they're ... they're not going to give up so once they got the momentum of our guys are the great job on continuing battle\nPlays executed and then you got the game out of hand leads\nTo the points on the board Christian homes with an interception return for talks on his first ever put it ... it\nWas a rather read exactly the way as opposed to a break on the ball and then we had pursuit where it needed to to end up\nReally taken out one of the block or one of the guys that were the men would be ... and crush and had a really pretty easy walk into the end zone so it's nice place\nA Twenty one to nothing obviously they score Seventeen consecutive points tool within Twenty one to Seventeen on each the scoring drivers there was a federally allow the drive to continue I Know that's part of the frustration that you have to do what to look\nAt you know we have a way\nIn that category uh you know it to openly so they that's characteristic number one and and no excuse for a number two so we we spend a lot of time on those this week understand him on on those third down conversions how big that is down in mind that says stop I mean we're already off the field\nAnd we are up in the past or when you can't do that you're going to have the discipline enough not to commit that foul and you know we've we've taken steps as we have plenty of reminders on uh the play within\nA bills start to finish the play and then there's got to keep working on it and I know that we understand that you know how important that every art is for a football\nTeam when you seize control and regain momentum you deal with an exclamation point the ... let's go to the to the situation it's fourth and want\nTo go for first of all some thoughts on\nThat point in the game and in point on the field and what were you thinking about in terms of going forward on one one\nKnew going in if we got in fourth in short situation I wanted to go for it because I wanted to extend the drive and I wanted our office to stay on the field is also\nKnew what what we had built in off ... really are for than in short calls there and the staff on that side of the bowl a rip the number of ways that we took into us our play bank for down calls for ... for the medium for a long\nForgotten a fourth one and they are automatically I was I wanted to go ready to go do it and they called a time out for a little more time to think about it but\nIt had already made the call what we're going to ... food that we talked about it over the time out kids executed and they went and got the first down through did a nice job on the rollout on mine enough time off into line given time and then really warrior he had to place them all\nYou had to get open and I did it in a great job and drew put where only he could catch it they made it pretty good cash to extend the drive and then the next play was a touchdown we kick off and then an interception and then the next closer touch down so it worked out are kids that are great\nJob four consecutive plays by the way things are pursuing my thunder there 'cause I was going to play by play but um [noise] you don't catch by Jonathan ... you got a pretty good but it was a terrific this\nWas probably right well the one that he had to produce ... found that\nAt that point the game and you never know whether it's probably three or you know planes Ninety three which one is going to be\nA difference and the and the football game and for us at that point were Twenty one Seventeen every bit of a motion and momentum and the stadium was all the members sideline so for us to capture that back that was huge for the
