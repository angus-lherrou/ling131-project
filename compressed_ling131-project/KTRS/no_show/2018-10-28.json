and uh\nIt just a um [noise] it just ...\n... they disappear for like seven to ten days and I I just haven't been seeing the wall this year it's weird\nBut I think it's going on now myself or you know getting on on the old a little black box here\nI didn't see as many deer photos from this weekend as they did last week get asked that early people may not be posted on quite yet but it looked to me like last week and I talked to maybe a half a dozen hunters and they swear they didn't see the movement that they saw last weekend and the strange thing is it's colder this weekend and it was last weekend\nAnd the moon's getting up there pretty big hit in the\nI Believe it to a waxing get ... you know you can tell me what that is because I don't remember [laughter] Waxman ... givens moon so I don't know and I I Know what a given monkey is I think well that's\nWhat I was going to say I was going to know I Know there's the givens monkey but I our our uh waxing given moon I don't know if I die\nI well we need some astrologers to call on that you know not that I care because I'm not up there in the dark right now anyway but you know it was just a strange weekend it's Saturday\nI'm them up there in the dark right now anyway but you know it was just a strange weekend it's Saturday the wind blows so hard or it blew covers off my analog\nPile and all kinds of things and and we try to let a big bonfire going and it was just horrible until just about dark thirties or when quit but we're out in the book Saturday in a couple of times I'll swear when does hit so hard to move the boat\nFive or ten feet and the fishing is just weird I mean you can go bang bang bang and catch them and then it shuts off and you don't get another bite for hours and I thought well it's just me you know um my dad used to say you're\nNot holding their mouth writer you're not junior dumb on the right side of your mouth or something starts and the fish to bite but I talked to other fishermen 'cause there was a lot of 'em out this weekend\nAnd they said the same thing it was just so hit or miss so it was strange but it was gorgeous man I mean the uh the fog on the water to smoke on the water is a song says was gorgeous in the morning and you've\nHad a pretty heavy coat and some gloves on and then by about new and you're starting to feel everything off so it to me it just it just went down as a as a strange weekend that's all I can say\nWe're used were you saying give they give us moon are given a given\nA waxing givens moon G. I. V. O. N. S. I think well OK given\nThe first to a shape waxing means it's getting bigger\nRight that much I knew it waxing that but I didn't know what given Smith\nOkay I thought it was ... but I I Can't remember and I don't want I don't have time to look it up but we got a call ... got a question for your damn good evening how you doing tonight\nGetting I listen you guys every week I really like a guy you both new is a good team you're great team well I'm\nJust a just check clash and I I uh had a friend was telling me um I guess that the the big bass tournament was down there at the lack of the Ozarks about two weeks ago [noise]\nUm and somebody say ended up at the guy that wanted a ... they said he was using a like a seven hundred dollar lower and I thought you're pulling my leg but I didn't look up\n... minutes called a Roman ...\nMother made um I guess swim bait and they're actually I guess handmade in Japan\nA custom made and I know a few people I think they said we're kind of like upset and stuff because they were saying we can't afford to live like that so forth but they basically to me it just takes one fish I mean anybody had that chance um I don't know if you've ever heard anything like that all those lawyers are are not\nWell that's the way out of my price range Daniel the you know a lot of the you know about that one but yeah\n... absolutely I mean there's a lot of controversy around or would dance talking about was the big bass bass which I have trouble saying but [laughter]\nYou know paid out a hundred thousand dollars so you know you could walk across the lake on the boats\nA and generally what what's happened in the past like the one in the spring I admire so much cause some guy it was pouring down rain an older gentleman standard resort got up and said I'm going back to bed it's raining so hard and said wait a minute I didn't come out way down here for this he was buying so\nWent right straight across the lake and the big Negron caught a hundred thousand dollar bass and that I admired not this year the controversy comes around a guy who remain nameless who's from the west coast is a professional fishermen\nThe laws say you can't be a professional fishermen on the lake where they hold the big bass bash\nBut it doesn't say you can't be a professional fishermen off the lake he also represents this lure company and yes I don't think there are seven hundred dollars there are hundreds of dollars but they're hand made in Japan\nAs all these you know really fancy designer soup does your lures that are out now a lot of them are made in Japan because they're handmade and painted and he did catch the fish on one of those lower so is that unfair\nWell you know in a way a even if I could afford a lower that expensive\nI'm not going to do it you know I mean I'm just not going to pay that money for a ... or so it you know they try and keep these tournaments pretty fair\nAnd they've cut down on the cheating they give a lot of people polygraph test that that when the big money no but there's always somebody looking for a better deal a better way of simpler way and and sometimes it's borderline on what you were I might think is is a legitimate you know or is fair\nAnd um I don't have an opinion about a one way or the other because they don't fish those\nBut I Wish it would be more for", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "28"}
