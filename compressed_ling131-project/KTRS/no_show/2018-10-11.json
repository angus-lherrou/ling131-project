games where you are you're close to it yeah so great to have you on first of all there there are a lot of different topics we want to talk about\nEvery coach that I've ever dealt with the first thing that they talk about is is people that touch their athletes on a daily basis whether it be strengthened conditioning but in particular most consistently\nUsed in your area of expertise is the trainer of the physical part of the key to keeping them in shape and are not in shape but keeping them healthy it is\nA lot of responsibility right for you and your staff so so you you have a number of people you work with the sport of football [noise]\nWhat's your message to them on that front knowing the consistent contracts are going to have with these guys throughout the course of the season tickets from day one what are some of the things you talked about this as they arrive in your department well\nFirst of all using the word expertise is a I don't know about that my dad says it will cost\nYou told me and I I Would say an expert I don't\nBelieve the hype actually the whole thing about our profession is held on the two things here to respect and trust\nAnd so what I stress ourself and I have a tremendous for people to work with well trained their their affable things like that a lot of time or they care and and you know what am I saying that I've really adopted for several years as people want to know how much you care before they care how much you know\nAnd I think that's really important for ourselves to understand and and then we'll have that kind of what they do still\nFans that are listening to hit really no idea that go if you will the operation so so when it comes to the training staff you also or this or do football\nHum how big is it and it accomplishes both fulltime and also student volunteers as well\nAs we have a more would be five times athletic trainers and uh and athletic training students and the thing that has come up here recently for ourselves as a kind of taken over a than work with very closely nutritional stuff\nAnd the mental health so\nIn addition to uh have an opportunity to work with the athletic performance ever closely which\nLeads me to the question that was kind of next on the list as you you know you've been at this for a long time and twenty three Missouri but more prior to that so [noise] and it's a male sketch how has your industry changed since you get into this business some Thirty years ago\nQuite a bit um [noise] yes quite a bit with the technology plus a\nTalk about this quite a bit and then it's been a reference several times to social media has changed the way that a way that our student athletes are are brought up if you will and so the component of mental health as it's\nThat's the leaves are are brought up if you will and so the component of mental health is extremely important and we need to be well aware of that and and handle that appropriately the nutrition and hydration um golly I mean back when I first started that has been a significant thing here of racial has a member of where\nShe was on the sidelines of change as well to have\nA have a we got a lot of what we've got all the bells and whistles for a you know we've got the ... we set up whenever we have an opportunity to\nHave to examine someone on the sidelines it's just a lot of different things on the sideline that helped us who are a service our players that's the most recent innovation or in on the sidelines I Believe that it is\nWhat about the throughout the course of the week when when it comes to\nYou know the rehab aspect of it in and things like that how has that changed over the course of the last two decades well\nThat that's a good question mark I think that the tools that we have to work with a changed it still comes down to relationships and ... and working with student athletes one on one of many times and we've had some great success here you know as well as I Do the three things to me for successful outcome need a good team physician ... I think we have\nWe're very fortunate the ones that we get to work with at about ...\nAnd then we have to have a decent rehab plan which I think we can provide I'd like to think we can to third thing you need you have to have an athlete that's willing to do anything you ask them to do when you ask them to do it and if you have those three components you will have successful outcome if you\nHad to just go along with Dr Smith in terms of getting athletes back on the field probably quicker than anticipated particularly when dealing with Andrew such as a seal why what's what's different in the technique that allows you to have success\nSoil you know and and talk about this a few times and they're well aware of it are very first ACL recovery that we had a chance to deal with here in Missouri together ... them\nAnd uh I had a propensity when I was finishing my career mall state to try to accelerate something beyond what they had been on for more than a when Barry had surgery I can remember asking Dr ... the appeal allow me I'd like to try to accelerate this a little bit\nAnd we've had for yourselves from so very from April seventeenth to all of this or we were pretty hard and sure enough on August thirty was ready to go says three and a half months\nAnd then that trying to test that can and and that has kind of become in ...\nFor for us in Missouri and I think you know we still are a little ahead of the trends but three and a half four months the U.S her and uh you know you've seen several of our student athletes and football have had those kind of those kind of results so far it's been very rewarding\nThere's a new facility as we all know that will be built in the south end zone and of course there's little house not only football officers football locker rooms strength in conditioning but you'll have a new\nTheory as well if I were to ask you to describe compared to what you have right now what you will have to be in a matter of maybe what nine ten months ... what the difference will be\nWell we're going to have a very very expanded into therapy area much more than we've had an opportunity to have in a long time and I uh for for my rehab plans I like to use water\nIn terms of the rehab so we are going to have a very very large uh we got a four lane lap pool when a person cold tablets right now we have an eight person told up so they have some difference right there in cold is used for recovery is has\nGot to moral pools that are state of the arts and it's just going to be a fantastic space in addition to the other for them and that is that we have now we also have that a lot of people don't know we've got a a ...\nIt's going to be on the new facility and that's a deal where you get in it's kind of like sensory deprivation\nA forty five minutes and they're supposed to be worth more hours of sleep so I really orders that for myself more than anything else or one of my former students are one of our former students as they athletic trainer for the Golden State warriors\nA ... fan so drew had told us about that so we had enough time to go on so we've got\nOne okay I Want to close with this because you know as you know you can't do it alone and your wife Eileen have ever raise your children are in this community for those that are that darn familiar with your children tell us about the while\nWe've got a we've got three real proud of all of them are Audrey our daughter works at the veterans United\nCommunication specialist so she really should be the one that they're talking to our son Adam as a police officer had our son Jared as a paramedic leadership hostile for\nA job and it's great to see you as always appreciate your time struck by my jelly when we return to our conversation with our player gifts to Mario ... rocket and Larry round to read the third up next on the tiger network familiar field", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "11"}
