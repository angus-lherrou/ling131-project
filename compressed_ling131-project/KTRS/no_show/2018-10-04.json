of what's that atmosphere is like inside of those ... very topics driven direct yeah\nThere's always a very direct agenda on what needs to be accomplished throughout the meeting and there's not any wasted no time and and there's obviously no question on who's in charge with\nWith the commissioner and a number one for ... that he always talks about the student athlete experience and the brand and the league that we have the opportunity to compete in he's very proud of that takes it with great ownership\nProvides us the structure of platform to lead our program is the way that they should in our conference we're we're lucky\nTo have and also the what was it a year ago that he wanted you to get involved in something you said well wait a minute I'm I'm not sure that it said on the right guy because they've only been in jail for a couple of years he said you don't have a choice in the matter basically it was a one sided conversation that I ended up saying yes are happy to do it then it's been a great experience for me yeah absolutely what exactly that\nEvery year a coach within the league is appointed as we in the chair or the director of the conference within the coaches association so this year was my ear\nAnd uh you know you you assist and help run the meetings when we get together and then present information to the director of athletics and the presidents and all the University of folks when you get to that setting so he runs the meeting set the table and uh they help guide me through it\nYou get to that site and so he runs the meeting set the table and uh they help guide me through it as along the way it was built by week's show for your football to our our guys did a great job we we handled coming off the Georgia law ... use it as a normal Sunday on on getting through the film\nAnd that wasn't behind us and then immediately start on the really a game plan for South Carolina\nWe had a couple of Boehner's practices on them and then our guys at a great job on on attacking a in the right manner and they were very mature and their approach on how they did it hard\nTo imagine are already a one third of the season completes a three and one of the thought through the first four games on kind of where there's team is right now\nIt was really fast so you know you're already in the end of the middle section of your schedule as you mentioned the and I think the thing that I've seen the growth\nOn both sides of the ball some things that were done really well we're gonna keep on moving the direction that our team is but also it it give us a chance to\nStep back grants to open scheme and lens of all the aspects of our game on how we can get better proud of our all kinds of line on how we move there were four weeks will be a little a block and run the football that's got to be an advantage for us moving forward and I think on both sides\nAs you get an FCC play both sides of the line is true but just so important and being able to control that part of the game and I think we've got an opportunity to do that for\nYou to talk about that a little bit later in the program in the meantime let's go back to the Georgia game itself goes for the benefit of this audience we haven't really had a chance to talk about that you had a chance to a week away from me last week when tiger talk with Jim struck with a stroke\nAnd what was your take away from all your team played audience will was to suck it right to become a critical point well number\nOne I missed the last Thursday night so I don't know it's true and I was on the road recruiting and that was good but also you look back at the Georgia game and and there were times during the game [noise] uh that we were in control of it and then there are other times because we turn them all over and we got to walk for a touchdown any time that you walk away from a game and your mind is\nDuring the turnover margin and you get a ... for a touchdown you're not going to win the game\nBut yet we found ourselves it was eleven forty game and the fourth quarter we had the ball the resiliency that our guys showed and continue to fight and and work through and make slaves we had opportunities we weren't that far off but yet we never could take the next step\nOn on taking control of the game and and making things happen in our favor [noise] um you know you're you're frustrated with the loss but also there's things that we took from that game that will continue to help those field and become a stronger and and move your program forward\nI think you subscribe to the theater you should never have a potluck\nThat's absolutely I mean you you should go you should get really should go years without that happened and we had a winter break down and in a production and and we've got to do a better job poaching it and then we got to go executed and and that can't can't ...\nWhat did you think about the job that they did defensively particularly in the way that they were defending your parent's game and stretching the field work\nWith they took away most of the deep stuff there we had a couple of shots that we didn't connect on a also look back and and maybe times with with some of the things that were having success running the ball\nOr early on maybe look back at it would we change any of those things vertically down the field but also underneath\nYou know we had a couple of other tribes going one bounce off the shoulder pads and then ended up in a in an interception of other couple of times those drives us we really get going so that the Georgia they did a great job on on doing some things there that had limited that they're really good teams but we're not that far\nOff to the second half were screened past to to to learn around ... was the perfect call and it just couldn't handle the football has\nA little bit behind him um regardless you know with the point of attack walk through the well we had room to run\nIn a deal that the number one priority is the ... end up with a number one with the plays over you got to play catch and uh we didn't do that a couple of times with you I think of the guys learn a great deal about ourselves and and it's going to help us as we get going down here in the heart of the schedule\nWas football coach very autumn is with us my Kelly were live from memorial stadium for a field in Columbia on the east
