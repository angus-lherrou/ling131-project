now it looks like I used the unreal he's got a grill ah All right so you went and saw mid nineties which Julie made reference to yes as out about the mid nineties well\nIt's a it's of a smaller film it's more of an indie thing it's directed by Jonah Hill it's his first movie that he is directed and it's set in the mid nineties and it's a it's a real slice of life movie\nAnd uh it does something that I don't know a movie has ever done for me which is I spent the first\nFifteen twenty minutes like actively disliking this movie and how do you actively look I was just like there and just moving around near Seattle I get like everyone in this movie just irritated me and I will say by the end I really enjoyed the film and came around\nOn the characters that I didn't like at the beginning\nWhich I thought was a fascinating the at her and so from a from a plot standpoint there's not a lot going on in this movie I mean it's about this kid he's fourteen it's you know Nineteen Ninety four fish and he kind of falls in line with these skater kids that are group and their two wells\nAnd starts hanging out with them and he's got kind of a rough home life\nAnd uh and it's just about his kind of getting absorbed\nInto this community of kids that are a little rough and tumble especially for this kid because he's a pretty like sweet sensitive kid and um and you just kind of spin Ninety minutes just hanging out with them like it it's really hard to believe that this movie is into from the nineties\nJust so slice of life\nWhat Jonah Hill not in the movie you know Jonah Hill is not in the ... and all looked totally different\nLast night on TV during the football game I watch a wave long lounge right away and he lost weight put it on last last and again and he's got like these he looks like a director now he's he's cool like shaded glasses on you know like turning into a grownup right see the doping\nYeah I mean I guess you've got to be what early thirties at the point\nI Would think so that was out of how many ... would you give that I'd give it like for you for going to be for everybody but\nIt's and it reminds me a lot of a kind of a forgotten Matt Dillon movie I think it was his first movie called over the edge yeah and where it was it it was filmed in ... you know it was filmed took place in the year was made and\nAnd where it was it it was filmed in real you know it was filmed took place in the year was made and which was Nineteen Seventy nine but it's about these kids that we would have called them burn outs and this kid kinda starts hanging out with them and watching his life kind of fell apart and those of us of my ilk\nOr who were working\nAnd having babies and raising families by the nineties is this going to hold anything for us you\nKnow I don't know because it's it's not really what drives this movie is it ... as much as it is just watching these kids hang out and the kind of\nInter personal politics at play and it's not like you said it's not a huge plot driven movie there's not this creates huge story that it's telling you so it's really more about do you are you going to end up liking kind of just hanging out in witnessing this world kind of\nFrom with and but it's not while there is this an established aspect to it it's not like you're going to this movie and you're like oh my God I Love Nirvana place more of that like that's not what they're doing\nSome story I I don't sound like I I agree like it sounds boring and I would say for the first Fifteen or twenty minutes I didn't like the kids and I was kind of bored but it will just talk about the first Fifteen minutes and really when you're a trick at some point something something kind of clicked and I I Do care about the the kid\nAnd we wanted to watch them navigate\nThe world have time for that All right that one is called a\nMid Ninety nine nine is that going to be like a ... a you know it had it and they're playing all over the place it's not necessarily a huge relief but you won't have to go to like the civil your product to see what else did you see I saw a movie called hunter killer a loo with Gerard Butler Gerard Butler\nWho last
