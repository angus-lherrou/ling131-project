area because to give some perspective these are all boardwalk towns on the Maryland Delaware border and that they're they're I mean they balloon up by five or six times their regular size during the summer months Hi Julie Buck and\nA yearly\nAnd and their party town who you know during the summer they become nothing but a giant party from one city to the next and apparently one of them got out of hand [laughter] well that's a rare [noise] um and and a policeman in Dewey beach Delaware says that of Philadelphia man by the name of Gavin cocoa\nGavin ... and his orchestra punched his horse\nHe punched police horse I ... apparently he's only upon and in the game of life and he punched a police or is now he's been acquitted of the charges but now Gavin cocoa is calling upon the police to

horse\nWas nagging um [laughter]\nBut you're going to say he was asking for it [laughter] I don't know just one of those ... and again in Dewey beach that's pretty much Thursday you know there's there's nothing that's going to happen if it's really going to shock much of anybody\nI think beach towns are great [laughter] ...\nNo no you want to stay away from ... what was your favorite part of

[laughter] so calming division later in walk on the beach yeah\nFor the rest of us it's all about a well just you know essentially taking part in the dry beach party but ah you know there are some cool places and there there was a hotel there we used to go to all the time because they had a a an ice skating rink in the lobby of fine yeah right and uh and you didn't have to stay in the hotel you could just go in ice skate if you want to do\nYeah right in and you didn't have to stay in the hotel you could\nJust go in ice skate if you want to do and that was the first place that I found out

story of a larger stories about your my I'm\nI'm One of the questions that we asked was you know what do we say to get out of a ticket and a police officer called in and he said that uh it was like Twenty years ago twenty five if not thirty and uh he was working with police officer simpler\nOh my dad used to call him captain midnight the in Rock Hill yes the rent you know hide right where that Korea's right at ... night ... would right between midnight and Manchester king of tickets no off of the night between lead singer in Manchester thinking\nGee uh never gave breaks and I think he

but hey you know maybe save some lives with my dad would calm camped and midnight because we'd be coming up from the ballpark and he's like ...\nOr so apparently your mother was driving that stretch of road and raw till ... and got pulled over and she didn't have a driver's license on her so they said well man what is your name so we could look you up in the system that you said\nMrs ... book it's Mrs ...\nBook the book was a kid and they said okay but we we need your actual name because she didn't look\nNot miserable [laughter] you know what an okay I Know it's silly sounding but back in
