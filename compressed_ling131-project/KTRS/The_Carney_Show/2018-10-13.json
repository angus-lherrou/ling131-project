wealth advisor Kevin good morning McGraw good afternoon how's it going well it's going pretty well you had\nA a tax seminar earlier in the week I heard it was packed to the gills had to go\nWe had another tax workshop it was on Tuesday the room was pretty full had lots of questions you know it's you know\nAll we do is just talk about the changes from last year's taxes to this year's taxes trying to get people up to date so that way they can try to make some informed decisions on different types of tax play\nBut we also show people real life examples on how they can maximize Social Security how they can get Social Security tax free right now we can take distributions from our qualified accounts like an IRA or traditional are re and not pay taxes at some point in our lives\nAs well so we just talk about some tip since tricks some strategy to help people keep their money and that's what it's about as well keep the money right\nNow is great and it's uh it gets people thinking in a different way a way in which they hadn't necessarily thought up so one more tax seminar a only a couple of spots left November six\nThat's the last one you that you're you're going to put on this year a couple of spots you didn't call the office three one for six for one ten ten or the website when retirement happens dot com now Kevin Lloyd I don't know if you know this but the stock market had an interesting week it did yes [laughter]\nAnd thank goodness I host this show because if I didn't host the show I Would be in full blown panic mode and I'm not even close to retirement\nAnd right yeah and I you know you think about it I bet a lot of people are in panic mode over this\nIf you you see the market to what you did on what was it a Wednesday dropping eight hundred and thirty one point to the Dow Jones industrial average dropped eight hundred and thirty one points about three percent you know\nThat's a huge number\nAnd I think a lot of people look at the end there probably wondering when they woke up Thursday morning or that Wednesday night a window of my balance is going to be when I turned on the computer and I take a look at it and I'm probably going to be down well here in the market you're probably downright right to sue but here's the thing\nThe market does this volatility is normal for the market right on the market does go up but it folks that does come back down and we know in the long haul and the market you know it should be up but sometimes we do experience these dips like this and when you see these\nMassive or decreases in the market for several days in a row sometimes I think that starts to stir some unrest right but why are we actually have an unrest why are we feeling a little anxious about trying to sell everything now and get out of the market\nI think it really comes down to saying do you actually really have a plan\nAnd many people McGraw their plan is really the investment strike because that's what we've been conditioned to write my adviser these these TVs these investment companies they can dish in the U.S has listeners in watchers as consumers\nThey can dish and us as listeners and watchers as consumers to think that the investments or\nHello hey hey how's it going [laughter] in Hong Kong later in the show we'll do you think if\nI had been we've been kind of conditioned to think that the investments are it I mean when you talk to your golf buddy or your neighbor down the street and they start talking about money or other things they usually talking about hey I'm up in this much in right now this ... this is done a great but that is not the plan\nC I Can't control I'm going to let you know we'll see I Can't control the market goes up or down what are you doing in the financial show if you tell me that [laughter] no crystal ball you have no crystal ball this algorithm software over here and X Y Z company or the right one\nKevin Milligan big five fifty Katie are asked now are we said Kevin that there's a website is a great resource for information when retirement happens dot com you wanted to highlight a white paper you have on that website\nWriting it when you go to our website when retirement dot coms there there is a\nCab to the occasion under one of those ... called education if you click on it\nThere's several different white papers on multiple different topics taxes Social Security retirement the different checklist budget things like that on there\nBut there's one that's been on there for a little bit of time and I haven't talked about it in a long time and the reason is because we really haven't seen a lot of wall send the market where would we justify people wanting to take a look at but we're we're out today I think the important to try to understand this a little bit better because\nI think we grow that people take more risk than they should with their investments I mean think about it\nWhich go back to like two thousand and set it I've already said people don't know the real risk that they're taking they don't understand what they're taken if you would have went to somebody in two thousand seven before the decline in the market to the end of a what marchers so into their opening night\nAnd someone came up you may have listened you may not have listen but they said hey if this market takes a died your account could go down to forty percent\nAnd I would guess there's some people knew that they if they could go down forty percent they probably would have backed off the risk a long time ago right\nBut why haven't people backed off the risk on where to go around today one hello again [laughter] they really want to get in and talked to a ... a suit why haven't why haven't they backed off and I think it comes down to is is even though\nWe're working with somebody that may not be a financial pointed they're still doing the investments but I don't think they're really doing that right because they say you're moderate\nWhy don't you go into this portfolio cold moderate right but we do we really know what that actually means or they come up with these questions and it's like a thirty questionnaire Fifteen question questionnaire\nAnd they started asking you questions how do you feel about a large gap stock mid ... small cash stocks government's securities you know if the market went down twenty percent we do stay would you sell they started asking a lot of questions and some people don't even know what some of these things me right okay\nBut these questions or or or looked at the end ... does sound like they're really important questions\nTo sue they they they're actually geared to say okay what's the maximum amount of risk I'm willing to take her how much money my willing to lose and then they'll figure out how to invest your money that would say that's not how you do it that's like like let's say let's say that I needed surgery\nOn blaming it on the table and the surgeon getting ready to cut and to me and he says oh wait wait by the way this is the anesthesiologist behind me here okay\nI'm going to start cutting into you when you feel your maximum level of pain they're going to give you some anesthesia van right that's how people determine how people how to invest people's money by these stupid questionnaires\nCompliance departments archaic and they still ask for these questions we put zero weighed in any of those questions because I always found that the people that want to work with us\nWhat do you think the least amount of risk to get to where they want to go out and you ask me how much money I'm willing to lose I don't want to lose any I haven't heard anybody say I'm really into lose money I'm willing to lose twenty percent of my account no one to lose money building I mean if we use the market as a tool for investing\nWe can't have loss right right\nSo we have to understand what the real losses in the portfolios that we have to sign in this white paper actually kind of pointed out because we were in our accumulation phase\nThe order in which the returns we received don't really matter will end up with the exact same amount of money assuming we just put it in a lump sum dollar cost averaging is a little bit different\nBut we were taking money out of that portfolio and retirement it's a game changer it's completely different I mean so this white paper Kyle lays that outage shows three portfolios getting ten percent average rate of return and it shows\nIt was three portfolios getting ten percent average rate of return and it shows one portfolio getting eight percent and I'm just going to go straight to the end here so it shows someone taking male withdrawals will cost of living adjustments\nAnd believe it or not the eight percent portfolio actually\nBeats one of the ten percent average portfolios because because it's the tortoise and the hair is slow and steady wins the race it does in it and I believe it and this is this is what I've always said if if I can show somebody how to reduce risk inside their portfolio reduce their taxes\nInherently it just makes our money last a lot longer why\nBecause we don't have those low lows we loved the high price but we don't want to ever lose any money but when you try to get it all on the up you're going to get it all down because no one's going to protected\nAnd here's the thing even with markets like this that we're having right now\nThe largest up days in markets are followed by the largest down days in the market right they all come very very close to each other you can just Google that and you'll find some sort of report on a good shows that are high up days are really close to high down days\nBut the thing is is we got to understand how this works so if if I could have more money getting ... percent rate of return versus a ten percent average\nWhy wouldn't want to take the risk to go for the ten if the aid is fine or going back and saying okay\nDo I want one or two portfolios do I want one getting like let's say one is paying ten percent ones paying eight percent and I said which one you want to be and\nOf course I Want to be in the ten percent I don't want a threat but what if I told you this one the other you're paying fifty percent tax and you're only getting a five percent rate of return but this one European zero tax and you're still getting the six percent or eight percent rate of return\nNow I'm seeing okay I'd rather take less risk and not pay tax write I'm Better off in the long\nWell that's the thing you were saying on the Thursday show is when you know you're mad because your portfolio last ten thousand dollars but you're like oh I just got tax Fifteen thousand dollars well what are you going to do about it\nRight when you think about this so let's say let's say that Europe twelve percent of the market's up twenty five percent I'm mad because I didn't get to twenty five right I Want to twenty five percent on the upside I only got twelve\nBut then the markets down twenty five and you're mad that you get your that your down twenty five percent because you wanted to take the risk to go up to twenty five before right or it wouldn't it be better if you say have vitamin ... and say okay it's more consistent right I just like golf I Know if I get up there in swing as hard as I can\nI'm not really that can hit the fair way all the time right right one at it and you're going to have a good shot the other night you're going to be in the rough ride to either so we just want to take an easy approach to it's like when you said the tortoise in the hair yeah let's take our time\nWill school little on a faraway developed a plan\nConsistently modern or the planned so when things like this happened they don't really affect us all those getting uh getting ready for the show today I came in and I was like well what about those markets and use it to me what do you care you're not close to retirement\nAnd it was like wow that's really focus on retired because yeah the markets are going to go down of our concern to go up you're not retiring today so I don't worry about it the people who are retiring today they're the ones who need to call me ... because if you think about this\nAnd you folks just do the math All right\nWhatever dollar amount and you start with a bunch of numbers positive and negative and start multiplying them you can just go ten years out and then take those numbers in reverse\nYou're going to come up with the exact same number at the end that the accumulation phase right distributions different you start off ... retirement with some bad years in a row you could run out of money pretty fast like somebody that started retirement two thousand and eight when the markets down thirty seven percent\nThe market was in fact even till the first quarter of twenty twelve so it took awhile to get to that point but it's I'm taking out five and I'm Down thirty seven dumb down forty two maybe even more then I get into to the next year and it's going down still I'm Still taking money out\nMaybe on that actually back to even until like twenty four team right because I was taking distributions\nBut it doesn't mean that you have to take the full force of the markets risk you should understand risk and how much you're taking how much you're going to participate on the upside of the market how much are participating on the downside of the market\nI'm not talking about annuities folks okay I'm Talking about investment well and that's why I think you know when we and we had people over the head with it and we joke about it but that's why you don't work with people in the accumulation phase because\nYou're not needed your needed when you retire because that's when that's when you can really be hurt right we don't call it a surgeon to be our general practitioner right\nWe call surging when they are needed right people need me when they're five years to retirement and then afterwards because I specialize in only working with those types of individuals\nBecause it does take some science it does take some technique and understanding to make sure we're measuring this appropriately to make sure we continue our money but also that we don't pay tax and we keep all we've got\nAnd that's why I think this white paper so good on the website that if you just go in there and go download it just got put in your information and you can download it I think it downloads immediately if I remember correctly\nI find that people taking on more risk it lowers their probability of success of keeping their money which\nIs so going okay but okay so somebody retired in two thousand and eight so instead of this hypothetical where you moved two thousand eight to Nineteen Ninety six and again I mean we don't have Eighteen years to sort of look out but if somebody retired in two thousand and eight\nWhat do you do to make sure they don't run out of money when the worst year was their first year\nWill you first come up with a plan you make sure that you understand how you're taking your money out of your account long before you retire okay even if you are retired now is a better time than than in ...\nYou want to make sure that you're taking out the appropriate amount okay make sure that you understand how much it is that you need because sometimes people just take money out of their accounts they don't really need it they just put it in the bank account right well how much tax in my opinion on that\nIs the market down that year and I'm doing now is it going to be harder to come back from that then you look and say okay we're like fixed income sources\nWhat how do I maximize they'll see a lot of people take Social Security for face value we here it's an entitlement benefit book but I don't think it's an entitlement benefit I think it's my benefit I think it's my\nMoney that I put in there my employers money they're put in there in my case I'm both of those people right it's my money it's your money make sure you take it at the right time to make sure last we want to get your foundation the strongest possible to pensions and everything is well to\nThen you look at the risk that could be in your portfolio was I went to a nursing home what if I died early and usually the risk and retired was not dying early and sleeping too long but\nWhat happens if inflation goes up to five six percent what happens if taxes go up what happens if I'm a market tanked marketing right we have to look at all these variables taxes\nThen we look at the investments last thing always the last thing because I don't know where to put people somebody asked me the other day where are you going to put me in with your investments\nI said I have no idea and I just gave me like how do you know\nDo you argue Sony TSE stock selling mutual fund you saw in the news what do you do write here's the thing I have no idea what you need because I don't even know anything about you and what your plan should look like yet until you paint your picture to me I don't know what to do [noise]\nBut when we do do the investments we should understand the real risk with the investments so we don't run out like this example in Seventeen years because we had one bad year to start off\nWith you know a on a side note hum I played baseball in college and there was there was always the sort of underlying philosophy\nWith the pictures and I guess hitters too but it was with pictures and pitching coaches\nAnd the pitching coach would come over\nAnd watch a pitch for three three three three pitches\nAnd they tell you everything that's wrong with you\nIn three pitches he right and you'd be like you know what I get I'm not known Ryan you know I get I'm not Bob Bob Gibson but you know you're telling me to change any haven't even watched me it's like\nThe same thing you say right where do I put my money well I I got to watch you for more than three pitches I I have to get to know you know what you do and know all about you before I can even begin to advise you\nI got a new what you want to write I got to know where you're at the same thing like your coach maybe if you would have watched some some some tape\nFor a few game right right right you could've said okay well here's here's what you're doing right now I wouldn't be the person that could help you their finances and not for four pitching this writer\nBut everybody loves to tell everybody had to do it without even knowing what it is they want or need\nAnd everybody's a Monday morning quarterback to write\nWrite folks it all comes down to the plan the stocks the mutual funds the ATF so the investments themselves are not the plant we've been conditioned to learn that stuff\nBut if that's all you're doing you should understand still the real risk right my problem comes in is when someone says there are a financial adviser and all they do is investments and they say either a planner and they don't talk about all this other stuff that they might say one of them to draw it in as a carrot to sell you this product\nI Know you will enough to know that this week even though the crazy weaken the markets I'm sure you've got a couple of phone calls from some clients who you sort of knew we are going to call because they call\nEvery time the wind blows um but I think for the most part most of your clients are off doing their own thing and same Kevin's got this seat he explained to me that sometimes the markets go down and we are shielded by this and they're just going about their their merry way\nYou know no matter who we are we're going to get a couple of calls right right I had a few yeah they don't tell me you don't mind tell you who calls yeah this week uh just from point saying hey just wanted to check in you know I saw the hundred and thirty one drop day\nWhat's my account look like right\nAnd I said well remember we're watching it if we think we need to make a change from what we've already done inside your plan we would have done it long before you called right because that's our promise to you we want to make sure that we protect you as much as possible I'm not going to sell it at the peak\nI'm not going to be able to buy at the trough right okay because no one's going to be able to sign that we might get lucky at some point in time but it all comes down to the plant control of the things\nYou can control when the things that are out of our country will happen [noise]\nThey don't affect us when I Am within five years of retirement and there's a down day of eight hundred points\nI Will be calling you know I'll be one of those there'll be\nA and a number of calls three one for six for one ten ten that's the phone number to the office you can
