retirement happens ... along with Kevin law firm legacy wealth advisor Kevin good morning McGraw good afternoon how's it going well it's going pretty well you had\nA a tax seminar earlier in the week I heard it was packed to the gills had to go\nWe had another tax workshop it was on Tuesday the room was pretty full had lots of questions you know you know all we do\nIs just talk about the changes from last year's taxes to this year's taxes trying to get people up to date so that way they can try to make some informed decisions on different types of tax planning\nBut we also show people real life examples on how they can\nMaximize Social Security how they can get Social Security tax free how we can take distributions from our qualified accounts like an IRA or traditional i._r._a. and not pay taxes at some point in our lives\nAs well so we just talk about some tip since tricks some strategies to help people keep their money and that's what it's about his book keeping money right\nNow is great and it's uh it gets people thinking in a different way a way in which they hadn't necessarily thought up so one more tax seminar a only a couple of spots last November six\nThat's the last one you that you're you're going to put on this year a couple of spots you didn't call the office three one for six for one ten ten or the website when retirement happens dot com now Kevin Lloyd I don't know if you know this but a stock market had an interesting week it did\n[laughter]\nAnd thank goodness I host this show because if I didn't know that show I Would be in full blown panic mode and I'm not even close to retirement\nRight yeah and I you know you think about it I bet a lot of people who are in panic mode over this\nIf you you see the market like it did on what was it a Wednesday dropping eight hundred and thirty one point to the Dow Jones industrial average dropped eight hundred and thirty one points about three percent you know that's a huge number\nAnd I think a lot of people look at the end there probably wondering when they woke up Thursday morning or that Wednesday night a window my balance is going to be when I turned on the computer and I take a look at it and I'm\nProbably gonna be down well here in the market you're probably down and write to us so I but here's the thing the market does this\nVolatility is normal for the market right on the market does go up but it folks that does come back down and we know in the long haul and the market\nYou know it should be up but sometimes we do experience the dips like\nThis and when you see these massive ah um decreases in the market for several days in a row sometimes I think that starts to stir some unrest right but why are we actually haven't unrest why are we feeling a little anxious about trying to sell everything now and get out of the market\nI think it really comes down to saying do you actually really have a plan and many\nPeople who ... their plan is really\nBeing ... because that's what we've been conditioned right my advisor these these TVs these investment companies they can dish in the U.S has listeners and watchers as consumers to think that the investments or\nHello hey hey how's it going for taking phone calls later in the show who do you think\nAbout it haven't we been kind of conditioned to think that the investments are it I mean when you talk to your golf buddy or your neighbor down the street and they start talking about money or other things\nThey usually talking about am up in this much in right now this ... this is done great but that is not the plan\nC I Can't control I'm going to let you know we'll see I Can't control the market goes up or down what are you doing during the financial show if you tell me that you know Chris still all you have no crystal ball\nThis algorithm software over here and X Y Z company or the right one none of them really know if the market's going up or down we can't control there\nBut there are some things that we can control when that happens it doesn't affect us as bad like we can control our taxes that's why I think it's so important to understand how taxes work in retirement it's one of the only time you can really control\nImportant to understand how taxes work in retirement it's one of the only time you can really control your tax situation but do you think about it you know it is let's say the market's down seven eight percent now will yeah I'm getting a little nervous about it but you probably pay more than that in taxes and you don't even think anything you Brian\nRight so I got sucked in this week and I know you're going to yell at me or\nLaugh at me but uh what every day I was I turned on one of the TV channels because I wanted to hear what the experts were saying why it was down to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so I got sucked into this vortex and I was just they were in their personal they're speaking the language and and\nAnd terms that I'd never heard before right\nNow is normal right and I'm like I don't know I mean I don't know what I don't know why why I'm watching because I don't know what\nIt is they're saying they're thrown out all sorts of you know uh as you say algorithms and you know highs and lows and and this and that and trading this and this and that was just it was just so\nConfusing and mind body and I was like I you know turn this off just wait to talk to Kevin about it because it's interesting you're a financial planner that only works with people in retirement we've been doing a show now for well over a year and you almost never talk about individual stocks individual investing\nMarkets and all that that stuff because as you say\nIt's important but if you don't have the plan it doesn't matter what you invested\nRight we've been condition as consumers to buy these things and it doesn't matter if it's at a new city I'm a stock a mutual fund any tea or a CD at the bank it doesn't matter okay the thing is as we've been conditioned to buy that stuff when really\nThat's like like let's say let's say that I needed surgery\nI'm laying on the table and the surgeon getting ready to cut in to me and he says oh wait wait by the way this is the anesthesiologist behind me here okay\nI'm going to start cutting into your when you feel your maximum level of pain they're going to give you some anesthesia van right that's how people determine how people how to invest people's money by these stupid questionnaires\nCompliance department archaic and they still ask these questions we put zero weighed in any of those questions because I always found that the people that want to work with us\nWhat do you think the least amount of risk to get to where they want to go out and you ask me how much money I'm willing to lose I don't want to lose any I haven't heard anybody I'm willing to lose money I'm willing to lose twenty percent of my account no one to lose money building I mean if we use the market as a tool for investing\nWe can't have loss right right\nSo we have to understand what the real losses in the portfolios that we have designed and this white paper actually kind of pointed out because see we were in our accumulation phase\nThe order in which treat the returns we received don't really matter will end up with the exact same amount of money assuming we just put it in a lump sum dollar cost averaging is a little bit different\nBut when we're taking money out of that portfolio and retirement it's a game changer it's completely different\nI mean so this white paper Kyle lays that outage shows three portfolios getting ten percent average rate of return and it shows one portfolio getting eight percent and I'm just going to go straight to the NPR so choose someone taking no withdrawals with cost of living adjustments\nAnd believe it or not the eight percent portfolio actually\nBeats one of the ten percent average portfolios because because it's the tourist and the hair is slow and steady wins the race it does in it and I believe it is and this is this is what I've always said if if I can show somebody how to reduce risk inside their portfolio reduce their taxes\nInherently it just makes our money last a lot longer why\nBecause we don't have those low lows we loved the high price but we don't want to ever lose any money but when you try to get it all on the up you're going to get it all down because no one's going to protect and\nAnd here's the thing even with markets like this that we're having right now\nThe largest up dazed and markets are followed by the largest down days in the market right they\nAll come very very close to each other you can just Google that and you'll find some sort of report on the shows that are high up days are really close to hike down days but the thing is is we got to understand how this works so if if I could have more money getting ... percent rate of return versus a ten percent average\nWhy wouldn't want to take the risk to go for the ten if the aid is fine or going back and saying okay do I want one or two portfolios do I want one getting a let's say one is paying ten percent ones paying eight percent and I said hey which one you want to be and\nOf course I Want to be in the ten percent I don't want to eat right but what if I told you this one you had the European fifty percent tax and you're only getting a five percent rate of return but this one European zero tax and you're still getting the six percent or eight percent right of return\nNow I'm seeing okay I'd rather take less risk and not pay tax write I'm Better off in the long well that's the thing you were saying on the Thursday shows when you know you're mad because your portfolio\nAlong well that's the thing you were saying on the Thursday show is when you know you're mad because your portfolio last ten thousand dollars but you're like oh I just got tax Fifteen thousand dollars well what are you going to do about it\nRight or how about this one time I think about this so let's say let's say that Europe twelve percent of the market's up twenty five percent I'm mad because I didn't get to twenty five right I Want to twenty five percent on the upside I only got twelve [noise]\nBut then the markets down twenty five and you're mad that you could do that you're down twenty five percent because you wanted to take the risk to go up to twenty five before right or it wouldn't it be better if you say have vitamin ... and say okay it's more consistent right I just like golf I Know if I get up there in swing as hard as I can\nCertainly not going to hit the fair way all the time right right one at it and you're going to have a good idea to nine you're going to be in the rough right and so we just want to take an easy approach to it's like what do you just said the tortoise in the hair yeah let's take our time\nWill school little are far away developed a plan consistently modern or the planned so when things like this happen they don't really affect\nUs all those getting uh getting ready for the show today I came in and I was like well what about those markets and use it to me what do you care you're not close to retirement\nAnd it was like wow that's interesting right do you focus on retired because yeah the markets are going to go down of artist to go up you're not retiring today so don't worry about it the people who are retiring today they're the ones who need to call me\nYet because because if you think about this and do you any folks just do the math All right\nWhatever dollar amount and you start with a bunch of numbers positive and negative and start multiplying them you can just go ten years out and then take those numbers in reverse or\nYou're going to come up with the exact same number at the end that the accumulation phase right distributions different you start off ... retirement with some bad years in a row you could run out of money pretty fast like somebody this started retirement two thousand and eight when the markets down thirty seven percent\nThe market was in fact even till the first quarter of twenty twelve so it took awhile to get to that point but some taking out five and I'm Down thirty seven dumb down forty two maybe even more then I get into to the next year and it's going down still and still taking money out\nMaybe on the actually back to even until like twenty four team right because I was taking distributions\nBut it doesn't mean that you have to take the full force of the markets risk you should understand risk and how much you're taking how much you're going to participate on the upside of the market how much are participating on the downside of the market I'm not talking about annuities folks okay I'm Talking about investment\nWell and that's why I think you know when we and we had people over the head with it and we joke about it but that's why you don't work with people in the accumulation phase because you're not needed your needed when you retire because that's when that's when you can really be hurt\nRight we don't call it a surgeon to be our general practitioner right\nWe call surging when they are needed right people need me when they're five years to retirement and then afterwards because I specialize in only working with those types of individuals\nBecause it does take some scientists does take some technique and understanding to make sure we're measuring this appropriately to make sure we continue our money but also that we don't pay tax and we keep all we've got\nAnd that's why I think this white paper so good on the website that if you just go in there and go download it just got to put in your information and you can download it I think it would download immediately if I remember correctly\nIt's they're available for you download any other white paper\nI get an email every time someone download something and\nSometimes I'm I'm sitting there and I'm like wow that person just downloaded I think every single white people say hey what's the name of this one is called understanding your retirement realities so really talks about more of like kind of the distribution of folks this is old okay it's an older white paper\nThe numbers are for a little older they're not outdated today\nBut I think that just is there to take a look at it and start questioning\nAm I taking on too much risk [noise] maybe\nI should start controlling the things that can control so when this stuff happens like this in the market doesn't affect\nUs Kevin Lloyd I'm ... him and hear his company is called legacy wealth advisors he has\nHis last tax seminar for two thousand and Eighteen November sick this is a one hour and you're happy to stay longer and ask\nQuestions a lot of people do I just wanted to go to our um great information it will not solve all your problems but it'll just begin to sort of show you and begin for you to think differently about retirement it talks about taxes in retirement talks about investing in retirement because\nThat's what Kevin does taxes and invested a retirement specialist phone number to register three one for six for one end to end or or the website when retirement happens you can register on the website also look at this white paper as well\nBack in a moment like five fifty ...\n\nHi I'm Megan from Fairfax Calif ... concrete patio our

our\nFamily take care of your family get together at right here packed the outcry forest dot com\nYou know you're telling me to change and you have an even watch it it's like the same thing you say right where do I put my money well I I got to watch you for more than three pitches I I have to get to know you know what you do and know all about you before I can even begin to advise you\nI got a new what you want to\nWrite I got to know where you're at the same thing like your coach maybe if you were to watch some some some tape for a few game right right right he could've said okay well here's here's what you're doing right now I wouldn't be the person that could help you their finances and not\nFor four pitching this right but everybody loves to tell everybody how to do it without even knowing what it is they want or need\nAnd everybody's a Monday morning quarterback to write write folks it all comes down to the play on the stocks the mutual fund the ATF so the investments themselves are not the plant we've been conditioned to learn that stuff\nBut if that's all you're doing and you should understand still the real risk right my problem comes in is when someone says there are a financial advisor in holes they do as investments and they say either a planner and they don't talk about all this other stuff that they might say one of them to draw it in as a carrot to sell you this\nProduct I Know you well enough to know that this week even on a crazy week in the markets I'm sure you've got a couple of phone calls from some clients who you sort of knew we are going to call 'cause they call\nEvery time the wind blows um but I think for the most part most of your clients are off doing their own thing and same Kevin's got this seat he explained to me that sometimes the markets go down and we are shielded by this and they're just going about their their merry way\nYou know no matter who we are we are going to get a couple of calls right right I had a few yeah I Know I mean you don't mind tell you calls yeah this week just from clients saying hey just wanted to check in you know I saw the hundred and thirty one drop day\nWhat's my account well clock right\nAnd I said well remember we're watching it if we think we need to make a change from what we've already done inside your plan we would have done it long before you called right because that's our problem is we want to make sure that we protect you as much as possible I'm not going to sell it at the peak\nI'm not going to be held up by the trough right okay because no one's going to be able to tell you that we might get lucky at some point in time but it all comes down to the plant\nControl of the things you can control so when the things that are out of our control what happened [noise]\nThey don't affect us when I Am within five years of retirement and there's a down day of eight hundred points\nI Will I Will be calling and I'll be one of those will be all you know uh and

I was telling somebody out here earlier today and I said uh you know I ... I haven't gone to the bathroom and a couple of days so I started Google in it and you know what it says the common cause for not be able to go the bathroom right away colon cancer chorus cancer to cancer I'm reading and I'm like\nOh my gosh I'm kinda tired yeah it's just that the um my stomach little bloated oh my goodness and maybe maybe I have colon cancer\nWorld Wide Web and everything the first thing is maybe it's cancer you're like I'm at a cancer right hey you know in my ear or it's cancer Brian so hey I start my toe you might have cancer and we go on line and we started reading All right off the it on TV\nAnd we start believing it when we should be really focused in on the our plan because we can control our play and we can't control the market going up or down but we can't control the volatility\nIn our accounts we can control how much you can swing on an upside down side and you cast all of that All right now and I mentioned earlier that I Would talk about this and I we got some time so maybe I'll talk about it now about saying okay how do I know what the real risk is\nAnd so we've been we've heard all these terms out there but ... what do they really mean I've come on instead of the few times but\nThere's a term called bait and made it really is just a measurement of risk compared to the stock market usually people use a benchmark like the back of a second it's the difference between say that again it's just comparing your risk to the to have some ... five hundred you know using that as a bug been sparked so if if I ever be the one\nThat means I'm taking a hundred percent of the markets risk okay so if I have a bait of lawn I better be doing at least as much as the S. and P. five hundred Reich stopped taking all the risk I'd\nBetter get all the returns but I Want to get all the up I'm going to get all the now do you know you're a beta want do they tell ya will we calculate all that for her ... year to see whether it be I mean allowing I've never heard of this on until the Enron and other people that don't do this I mean if if you if you're doing it in the investments and they're not even telling you this information\nNo I don't know what the heck no one I've ever talked to ever said you have a beta or one they've said to me what's your risk factor or what's your what's your comfort level auditor right up in like right and I would throw it out and which didn't make it comes\nDown to being conservative monitor aggressive knowing what the actual betas of the portfolio but then you have this thing called standard deviation oh my gosh what the heck is the standard deviation well it's kind of like the measurement of volatility and your accounted seats or the amount of risk you're taking into account and salsa typically measured okay\nThen you look at your mean but we might knew what they mean is that the average okay I like to look at a ten year average 'cause it pulls in more years for us to take a look at it right so what we do is try to figure out what our maximum I capture could be our maximum down capture within a given year\nWe had three standard deviations to the main so let's say for example my standard deviations Fifteen okay All right so if I multiply it by three it's forty five additives in me will see the means nine I could go up right as much as how much\nWas it a four percent okay so if I got forty five plus nine\nWe could go up as much as fifty four percent but what's look at it on the downside so if I subtract forty five from I mean I could go down as much as thirty six percent so what is telling me is within a Ninety nine percent probability I could be down as much as thirty six or up as much as four fifty two\nTaste ers St Louis and save forever before we go back to the\nBrian

located in this sub division as thirty three hundred and Seventy four square feet of living space\nAnd or the condition and the oh the writer has not viewed the property however are you ... we did similar properties of soul between a hundred nine and a hundred thirty dollars a square foot was a pro finished lower level adding another thousand square feet to this house\nEvery sale price for the development and the last twenty four months it's been three hundred and fifty nine thousand dollars which featured the sales having three car garage and top the top end of the houses having finished lower levels\nTaking the every dollar per square foot the properties is is estimated to be worse between three hundred and forty nine to three hundred and fifty nine thousand dollars\n[noise] so I get a call the other day and age the seller had a list to do with a different broker which doesn't bother me at all as I told you many times are ... are free\nIf you want me to hire me that would be fabulous but you're not obligated to and I don't do a sales pitch there in fact the only ... sales pitch might be hey you're selling in the future and you want to interview me to help you sell your

right now it started out at three hundred Ninety thousand and they've dropped it to three hundred and Seventy five thousand it's been on the market for more than four months it's\nMore than four months in this market says something's wrong right\nNow the house looks great and I so I did my homework and I did the day is on the market and and what I what I realized is that this houses are set up home which means that\nThey were asking three hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the home when it should've been at three hundred and fifty forty thousand dollar difference is a bunch of money to almost Fifteen Percent\nOf people that are buying between uh you know a three Seventy five and four to court or whatever just as a number and they go to this house and they go to other homes that are properly price for that price range the other homes are gonna show they have a lot more\n\nLong as we can read his blog the days go fast [noise] ... that's what it is here\nFor ... by the way for those of you who work to where I almost a program for the VA the Veterans Administration right after this week in real estate [noise] hemorrhage states would I Do for a living hosting the VA program

exactly exactly um\nHow many agencies have looked at the property how many agencies have sent it to other clients of bears how many people have looked at it on the uh on the Internet [noise] how many how man they just sat in from me so\nIf the houses and selling yeah condition location in price\nWell you've got to be able to provide the seller at the information that led to make good decisions and almost always it's it's you know the answers were says well you know it's the price\nIt isn't necessarily the price and what a good realtor does for you the seller is goes out there and make solve the contact with all the people that have looked at it and talks with real truth about what they think of the property and what did they think should be done it is all\nRight\nTo draw information from other professionals in the industry\nTo provide the seller you can do the open houses\nAnd see what the people thought you call them back and find out where they bought you find out what they didn't like about this house you collect information because every seller needs information to be able to determine what to do next with their property however\nIf you don't have any information months maybe

veterans that [noise]\nThe show's designed so that you can sit in the comfort of your car or your living room\nThe benefits that you have earned\nNot entitled to you've earned\nOne thing I always try to remind everybody that's listening is there's no such thing as them running out of money because you start using yours I'm not sure how they budgeted but I Do know this they don't look at the check book when they order your benefits\nSo you should use you should use them and you should listen and a few or a family member of a trend you should turn this show on every Sunday at two AM five fifty caked ers because here's where you learn how to take out maybe\nYour mother or your father has issues and you didn't know you had benefits that covered those issues maybe you've never even used the benefits and you think well maybe not title to I'm not a that's wrong\nYou're a veteran your title your benefits your entire life I didn't start using mind to five years ago\nBad mistake on my part but I quickly caught up with it and you know what they can't do that can't cancel your VA benefits because you're getting expensive ... really expensive batch we'll talk about that more later in the

hitting you laying out and order a sucking up is\n[laughter] a lot\nThose thanks for having me back and trying to remember your name are seen on Mars\nScenic Gunter yes the director of public relations and the director of volunteers and the director of the director of everything or\n... not quite I Do have a good job and I get to enjoy lots of things\nYou have your hand and just about everything at some point or another don't ya a lot of things are not coming\nOut of here you come that gray area isn't there\nAt work you do have a fabulous products\nAt the store these days um do you want to\nTalk to us three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven and I do want to uh [noise] uh let you know if you read the river from times last week\nThere was an article uh there was not so pleasant and um I just want you to know the topic of today's show is about whole health and public relations and volunteering however\nIf you want to call in and talked about that article three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven it's um it's a very sensitive issue but\n\nYou know for some of it's just really disturbing especially if it's happened in our family and it's an intensely personal subject but that's what this show is all about I Want to apologize in advance of we seem clumsy or insensitive\nIf you make any of those calls but it's the commitment of the veterans radio network in its representatives of the Veterans Administration to try\nTo prevent these issues through communication an open dialogue so if you do want to talk about the article three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven or you can call in for anything else so ladies are you ready absolute happy alright so\nHow does\nSo Morsi to you or the head of volunteers\nTo beat the U.S the head of whole health so tell me\nKen volunteers assist people in the whole health\nThe whole health has a whole wide range of programs ... and and I know ... and her group has been intensely I'm working on bringing up different areas so before she was even able to hire employees to do yoga\nAnd other things we had been coming in as volunteers or really\nEarly and so we do rely on the community to assist us as we're bringing up new programs and doing things for our veterans now we do require that you have the appropriate licensure ... if you're ...\nAnd I had a D I didn't have meant she she had to lay right underneath there who might as well be ... and went to the three other directors and I listen to these ladies and I interviewed them because they can't make it into the studio which will play that interview later on not today\nThe bottom line was their commitment and if you could watch the passion that they exude when they were talking to me about their commitment to getting veterans every\nThing that they can get them and the reason I Know the one eight hundred to seven one thousand is because we repeated it didn't add in those interviews a thousand\nTimes so if here's another thing they took over six hundred thousand calls this year already so if you call them and say what the problem is\n[noise] you know I have to do it a couple of times just like calling the IRS or any kind of ... do you call your cable company and it takes a half a dozen phone calls\nBut what you want to do is be put on hold right you will not be put on hold and they their goal\nIs to get used the benefits so the daughter of this man correct his dad who or is it the sister of this man just or of this\nLast night I learned this week that she is entitled to speak for him to benefits and help her brother use and get the benefits cheese aren't they may even ...
