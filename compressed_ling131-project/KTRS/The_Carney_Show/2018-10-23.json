know I Know when you're man I'm Sorry to hear it I I I Do\nHave a tendency to show up in odd places um\nLike for example Michael Jackson videos and horrible terrorist bombings\nSo to answer your first question and I should say this is all part of this book that I'm coming to talk about the book festival let's call the complete book of running which tells the stories and others [noise] yeah I was one of those guys who found myself up turning forty this was some years ago and\nWas terrified because if you turned forty which seemed impossible just a few years prior to that that means that someday you'll agent die\nAnd I decided if I ran a marathon I wouldn't die and even though that seems completely illogical ladies worked so far [noise]\nSo I ran the Chicago Marathon in two thousand five and it was miserable and it was just as agonizing as you might expect running twenty six miles to be if you're not good at that\nBut then a very strange thing happened which was that I finished it and instead of saying to myself thank God I never have to do that again as I expect that I Would I said to myself I Wonder if I can do that faster so I became a fairly dedicated amateur marathon run fourteen to date\nAnd as you suggested in twenty Thirteen I ran the Boston Marathon I ran that one as a guide for a blind runner I was working with an organization that provides such guides to visually impaired runners and we had just crossed the finish line just I mean four minutes prior we were standing\nGasping for breath and the other side of the finish line when the bombs went off a and I remember watching this enormous explosion not allow this noise I've ever heard of this huge plumes of smoke going in there and we're like what the hell is not and somebody said it sounded like a bomb and I remember standing there and actually said it can be on\nHow is that and somebody said it sounded like a bomb and I remember standing there and actually said it can be a bomb who bombs marathons so yes and and what happened after that and and all that other stuff is a story told in the book\nWell Peter said go way does and he'll be at the Jewish but says Sunday is the keynote speaker his book the in Complete Guide to running brings in this way and staying with a a running the Julie brought up which I never would have because I'm a big fan of being stagnant um yes\nI just saw eddy Izard who is in town and he just didn't like\nForty five marathons in forty five days or something like that yeah he\nHe decides he's an interesting guy who does exactly what he wants I've interviewed him on wait wait don't tell me and he like me got into running late in life but unlike me he really took it to an extreme and so he and devotion to one of his political causes he's very political uh he decided to run a marathon every day and I think it was I Want to say twenty three days\nYeah honor of wasn't that you\nKnow what it is only three ... in honor of\nHow many years now from Idaho was in prison I think but it's it's it's incredible I Can't do that I was pretty impressed\nI don't get me he was on with us not to right before he came in the day he said do you talk to you and then you know he was disappointed\nThat well I Know I'm a very disappointing I it was weird I think in the end well off in the world will finally come to an end when every person has been on every other person's podcast and then we'll be done I got I should\nI'm Sorry I should say by the way you sent me a little bit of a panic I'm not appearing in St Louis Jewish book festival is Sunday Sunday week from Sunday Sunday the fourth I'm Sorry member it's okay I was like oh my God do I have to get in\nA plane and just getting to know Sunday the forces when I'll be there and just looking forward to it and just screwed my joke on Halloween so what I\nShould say another thing I should say that in the book there is a St Louis connection one of the chapters is about a race I ran in St Louis back in twenty Thirteen um right before the Boston Marathon a so called the the cupid on the runway ran up and down your main market street\nMarket street naked\nExcept for a pair of red boxing sure boxing briefs or in some fairy wings so that's a story\nWell congratulations and thank you is this the half hour session or the full hour said [laughter]\nNow it's your our as they say\nYou got to ask you this on this show which I took many many times I enjoyed immensely\nAnd whether it's a mole Rocco whether it's Paula Poundstone who you hear a lot or or prevent zoo I mentioned RPG here there are so quick with their answers I just got to believe\nThat there is some kind of charging ahead of time and there's a show meeting ahead of time where there's no little we know we're\nWe're much simpler what we do is be out of the show and we added out each week about an hour worth of\nA lie to you know it's a matter of fact you know there's a lot of people who do we do I\nMake fun of current events there's you know you name him Stengel bears that's miners are meant to be there's thousands of people to do this not to mention all the ... and I think that what I think that what makes us stand out as we are genuinely improvisational with the panelists have no idea what I'm going to ask for him and I have no idea what they're going to say in response\nTo come across that way at all it doesn't know well I mean to me that I was\nIn the sense that like if one of my Paula Poundstone says something for example and crack up I Am genuinely cracking up because I had no idea she was going to say that\nOh I Believe that but when I ... I find it hard to believe in that nobody Mrs you know how many how many miss strike out Saul ... days broadcast\nI understand but you my friend or live in the radio and we would never dare do that in fact one of the things that I you know because we do the show in front of a live audience every week normally here in Chicago we've done it in St Louis will will do it all over the country next next month on our land though but\nWhen people come and see if they tell me that one of the things that they enjoy about seeing it live as we do so much more stuff\nAnd some of that's cut from the broadcast for time some of its cut from the broadcast because there's a very good from of it is cut from the uh broadcast because we if we were to broadcast it we would immediately all be fired NPR it'd be stripped of his license\nAnd the headquarters demolished insulted now so I'm certain that I think is the fun part so we're very careful about what we let people you know the children of America here over breakfast unless\nLike religious sell the jokes that kind of thing\nYou know about not really fun I got I got attacked by Bill O'Reilly\nWas I was kind of an honor I've been waiting for him to get around to me and it took a few years\nBeyond your ...
