Kelvin zero also to help answer any question\nThat Israel has a nice to be All right the website is when retirement happens great resources and you have got a checklist and this is what I Want to talk about you have a retirement checklist I Do so so there's about\nThirty questions on it um it could be more ... and you know we could again make fifty on there who want to but we kind of boils down\nTo the whole purpose of this is really to get people to start thinking about what should I be doing for retirement so it doesn't matter if you're gonna retire and five years\nOr you're already retired you should have had these ...\nFive years or you're already retired you should have had these questions answered long before you took your money out of your account okay so this checklist we can find on the website you can find it on my website when retirement happens\nDot com okay and just go to the education to Abbott says retirement plan checklist somewhere on that list and all you gotta do is basically I think it says get PDF for download you put your name\nYour phone number in it and it gives it to you and your downloaded immediately for some reason it doesn't work for ya which it does but it for some reason it does you can always email me at a cabin at when retirement happens dot coms with Kevin at when retirement happens dot com and\nYou're saying that these thirty questions you all you have to answer yes to all thirty of these questions before you're ready to retire\nYou have to answer yes to every single one of these questions and if your answer no\nEar advisors probably not talking to you about these things and this is kind of just a checklist to help you get to that point right I mean if you if you're thinking about retirement you probably need a savior in retirement you're still probably needed right because what if we're not getting the information\nThat we're supposed to get it was the joke we had in last week's show how do you get to the store first get to the store and then we'll tell you how to get there right now we have rights higher okay first retire and then we'll help you know I don't know you need somebody to help you or is that right because people actually do come into my office and and I asked him some of these questions and they say\nAnd one of these could be right for you to a man and we will take the necessary information from you and do the rest [noise] doesn't cost the thing they do hundreds of dollars\nTo give us a call today are up in your local manager\nJohn ... matter much more of a very ... owner stop and think Karl ... living rain delivering the in and around the\nOwner of medicine shop in Africa where they can do for telling me for prescription from every little known them come to their\nLaw\nKevin ... here and we're talking about retirement because retirement is going to happen are you going to be ready the website when retirement happens ... great resource for some great information including his retirement check was that we're talking about ah do you have another one they're forced\nTo number nine basically says my retirement plan is based on net number so I can easily adjust for changes in the tax code [noise] so what does that really mean does that mean\nHere's my budget my living expenses okay here's everything I Need to do to do things I Want to do in retirement I go on vacation and pay for the house for the cars electric bill whatever okay\nThose are the that's the amount of money that I Want to spend every single month and retirement that want to spend so it's my next after tax money\nSo when people come into my office I ask them you know do you know how would you need on a monthly basis okay now I don't just go by that number because everybody is usually wrong okay because we do a lot of people just don't know how much money they really meet whatever number I gave you a guarantee you it's wrong they tell you\nI Need I Need Seventy thousand dollars I said OK Seventy thousand dollars\nIs that being said Seventy thousand grows ... sometimes I have to explain between that and grow so gross is before tax net his after ... and they said you know while making Seventy now right so I think I Need Seventy cars said okay well that makes sense well how much you're putting in your for one can't win ten thousand and okay so\nYou make Seventy but you're putting in cancer you really get in sixty right yup OK senior member those spike attacks is Social Security Medicare taxi got that you can knock that off there also and he got federal tax and got state tax and you got your family plan for health insurance which was really your check is\nLike three thousand dollars a month or two thousand dollars a month and then they say oh yeah I guess I guess the only need that in that\nBut in reality what I really want to do is I Want to go through a budget line by line haven't you feel this out\nWhy do I do that creates an exercise for me to really understand that you know when you're real budget really looks like right because I never really seen people do exactly what their budget looks like except for a few engineers that have come into my office with their ... they're beautiful spreadsheet right here\nAnd I love to go through those as well too but I like to see things Lynette in doubt because see things in play differently as well to going back to that first question\nIf I have a thirty year mortgage right in my house payment and we'll just say it's\nAnd if I have a thirty year mortgage right in my house payment and we'll just say it's a principal and the interest payment not as ... is a thousand dollars a month I Know that thousand dollars a month will never ever get higher\nWhy because my team is a thirty year fixed pain in my house is paid off it'll never changed now we do know that more goes to the interest in the beginning and more goes to the principal at the end but that thousand bucks is still a thousand bucks for Thirty years right so why would they inflate that right All right so that makes sense not to do that\nBut what about health care premiums\nWhat about long term care costs that maybe those have to be inflated six to eight percent so we want to make sure we're assigning the appropriate inflation value not just a flat four percent on everything\nWhile you also do everything you do how much you spend on dry cleaning how much you spend on going out how much you spend on TV of\nNetflix the a ... ... to to the Fox theater to your card games do you go to blues gains tell me what does it look like to see if I Can't help you pay your picture to me there's no way I can put together a financial plan I have to know everything\nAnd some people like the old things close their vast were really good at what we do but we are ... reading mind right now we just need some help doing that so you always want to plan from after attacks perspective now\nWhat else can we do to try to stick to that situation which comes onto a another question unless you were you know something\nI well I just don't say that it's it's like um if you write down\nEverything you spend in a week right and you're like oh my goodness I Can't believe I spent money on that and that and this and this right or\nYou're you're trying to lose weight so you write down everything you eat and at the end of the week like I Can't believe I had for Snickers bars right now there are I don't even I thought I didn't even like Snickers bars at the same thing with ... with this plan right down all the money you you spend it you know and how you spend it and what you think you spend in what you spend two different things\nThey are in my Achilles heel is ... is our bass pro\nWhen I go in there I rarely go in there and just by one thing usually I get a lot of stuff and my basket and then you know there are some times that I Do go into a store and it come out with nothing but don't you feel kind of guilty coming out with nothing like seriously I didn't steal anything I'm just because I didn't find anything and I didn't want to hear [noise]\nBut but yes we have to know these things for my wife is target some people could be Wal Mart or what have you ... you can't leave all more with one thing you know you're right everything's cheap at Walmart you're right you're right uh what was going to do next one so this I think is very important people don't understand how this works so we try to teach you dinner workshops\nMy retirement plan takes in consideration that the possibility Social Security can be taken tax free even was spent double income of more than fifty thousand or so the worst hit the thousand could be a hunter could be more than that\nIn English would that really means is is that what I hear is a lot of people say if you make more than thirty two thousand as a married couple you will pay tax on your Social Security folks if you've heard that your advice or doesn't know what he's talking about your tax person doesn't know what they're talking about right\nCalculation the IRS does to determine if Social Security tax of all\nIf you're a in a park you know you can write it down it's half the Social Security puzzle taxable income plus any interest on tax free interest\nAt that together if it's under thirty two thousand your Social Security is not taxable if its wing thirty to forty for up to fifty percent of it can be taxable anything over forty for up to eighty five percent can be taxable\nBut just because they can be taxable doesn't mean that it is practical because I have clients who spend double income north of a north of a hundred thousand and they're still not paying tax on Social Security\nSay that again you have people who were making eighty Ninety a hundred thousand dollars who do not pay taxes on Social Security\nRight so those individual that keeps saying that if you make more than thirty two thousand dollars you pay taxes the wrong they just don't know what they're talking about\nI can walk you through the numbers are could walk them through the numbers but I'm not going to do that but I'll walk you through the show you\nHow all of this works soaks I found that if I can show you how to not pay tax on Social Security or pay the least amount of money in tax on Social Security your money last a lot longer right\nAnd so we want to make sure that we maximize every opportunity and one to keep my money from the government I think is very very important it's not our patriotic duty to increase our taxes to increase it\nI think if you were to ask it just a hundred random people or everybody listening to this right now raise your hand if you think you have to pay taxes on Social Security or you must pay taxes on Social Security Ninety nine percent of the hands would go up\nI Would I Would believe you're probably right but I Would also say go on to say that we can line a hundred people up in this room that we're in right now even though they went in there but\nUh we could say how many of you pay too much tax and I would guess that over Ninety percent would raise their hand and say they pay too much tax yes but did you know that about fifty percent of Americans don't even pay tax\nAnd that's based on statistics of people that actually filed returns not including people that don't file returns because they don't have enough income right right so maybe the mentally or Saturday legitimately do not pay taxes right now I'm not talking about dating a guy I tell people that they just don't have to pay tax write\nThe thing is is let's have a strategy not only for Social Security but also for other income so we can figure out how to protect something that'd be awesome\nWho says that you have to pay tax on your IRA when you pull money out of it I'm Talking about traditional not raw fish and don't let traditional who says you have to pay tax cycle Sam says that will Uncle Sam actually says it can be it is taxable\nWhen he does not actually say that you have to pay tax on it so you have to understand the tax returns right in the same thing when I was joking with you that one day and I said you know\nIf I gave you a million dollars to jump out of an airplane without ... and you said no and I said well what am I told you that the the airplanes on the ground over yeah we don't line up to get the million bucks I sprained my ankle\nSo that they're not a problem [noise] the thing is you have to understand taxes in how the world [noise] and that's another thing that we do in our workshop and show people how to pull money out of these types of the count yeah they're taxable but it doesn't mean that you have to pay tax with a gentleman\nTo actually just forget everything you just call Kevin because he will figure it out for you that's the more I Do the show the more that just should be the whole show called Kevin\nThat just reading the initial call Kevin Kevin instead of coal salaries that are called better cause you have a three one for six for one tent and or the website when retirement happens there's a checklist we've got time for another one in this day when he was on the on air\nWe do All right so again my retirement plan considers taxes in such a way I Will know which account to spin from first which one is spent from second or third force so on I Will know how to keep my taxes as low as possible I've\nBeen to the tax seminar I have learned this I've seen you chalk this out and game play this out this is sort of to me this is the holy grail because nobody knows which account to take the money from causes certain other things to happen right\nSo how when when you take your money out of different types of a cowboy actually dictate your taxes so there's only three accounts doesn't matter how rich you are how much money you save you can only put money into three spots three categories taxable tax deferred or tax free\nNo other places so that\nTo a taxable account would be like a U.S an after tax investment in a CD or stock or a mutual fund or something like that that if it gets entrance door dip it in you will get that ten Ninety nine or that interest income showing up on your tax return the would be something like a four O. one K. and I are re\nBut tax deferred typically you're differing the taxes to some later point in a lot of those accounts you have to take money out at Seventy and a half right right [noise]\nThe third accounts tax free now some people when I ask them if they would tell me example of attacks Rick how some people say immunity by Judy bonds tax rate right there right and it can be a writer you would have a Missouri bond you live in Missouri Missouri interest is tax free\nThe federal inches this tax free sometimes you have triple exempt or like Puerto Rico or something like that\nBut I don't know if you want one of those bonds they hold off on those from any ways they can be taxable though why would they be tax will solidify pay ten grand for that bond and it kind of came up in value eleven now you have a capital gain if I sell it okay so you can pay capital gains tax\nSecond thing is is miniscule bonds caused cats are can cause tax on Social Security ah so there's still tax that can be a part of it\nNow we know Roth IRAs grow texture you pull without tax free rein in some included will in the provisional calculation determined to Social Security tax more not so how will we when you pull money out of these different types of accounts will dictate the amount of tax sometimes I see people say Kevin\nI didn't pay taxes last year I use my Roth IRA aren't you happy that I did something like that 'cause that's where my advisor told me to do and I said no actually that's probably the worst strategy to do that for you because remember that accounts always growing tax free beside you didn't pay tax last year\nMaybe you could have done something more better because now even though you pay no tax next year you're going to be in a thirty three thirty five forty percent tax bracket later on down the road because you just did that\nNow did your advisor tell you that when they did did they tell you that it probably would have been better to use another that recount you just chose the Roth nope he told me she told me to exactly we should know how and when to pull money from these ... would\nYou rather use the money that's growing tax free or the money that's growing taxable rather use the money that is taxable and let whatever's growing tax free continue to grow tax rate right or you\nSay okay now I got the ... bird like IRAs and for all one case maybe I should spend some of those down first where we've all been conditioned to spend them down last right because you're getting the power of compound the tax burden gross yes it's the way to do it\nNo it's not the way to do it all during the chicken the tax wrote down the kids like the government chicken our budget down the can down the road like our government kicking the national debt down the road and then she'll leave the rubber will hit the road and you're going to be hit with half the hefty tax is\nMake sure you understand how that works if you don't have a tax plan you do not have a financial plan\nRight interesting because never before meeting you would I ever think that my tax plan is associated with my retirement plan in our time planning to do with my tax plan right well let's say you pay X. amount of money in\nTaxes and what if you didn't have to pay their money in Texas now you get to keep it that could make your money last longer\nI don't know I just think if I keep it from taxes I could have extra money go on vacation or\nIt could be the difference of watching it and they are going on because\nI Would think are keeping your money tax free is probably pretty good strategy in retirement after listening to Kevin Lloyd the show was called when retirement happens the website when retirement happens dot com that retirement checklist he's reading off from his right there on the website you can read it and read all thirty questions yourself right now\nWhen you are ready when you are and within five years of retirement or if you are retired\nYou and or your spouse Kevin law and here's the phone number [noise] he's waiting patiently their phone call through in four six four one tent and or the website when what time it happens like I'm\nBack in a moment on ... [noise]\nThe opinions you hear on the T. R. S. are those are the host caller asked Internet this early those visitation it's management or orders commenters suggestions contacted a PR ask dot com thanks for let's say [noise] or\nA\n... on a on a weekend here the big five fifty K. tier I Believe just starting to turn and that means ... season is right around the corner and that means we are one more week closer to retirement are you ready to even ...\nMore week closer to retirement are you ready to eat in a gun to have that conversation what are you doing about getting tired well guess what no longer do you have to worry about it no longer do you have to\nPut your head in the sand that's why Kevin Lloyd is here he is here to work with you to help you get to retirement because taxes\nAnd investing is different when it comes to retirement and Kevin always taught us that through in four six four one tent and his operators are not standing by buddy is there on Monday morning bright and early three one for six for one tent and and the website is always open when retirement happens dot com\nThere is a tax or excuse me there was a time a checklist that we're working off that you can see for yourself or that the website when retirement happens economic give us another uh there was another question from the list there\nSo one this is probably one that I've talked about a few times but I think it's still good for people to know and it says I considered the effects of a new way on my four one K. distribution and how it may or may not reduced by future income taxes anyway is people don't do it in your way as I say I have no idea but if if\nThere's any way is is a short for ... unreal lives depreciation it only comes into effect when somebody\nWorks for a corporation that you can actually buy stock inside the four oh one K. and okay okay\nSo if you ever been buying your employer stock inside your four one K. you are eligible for potential tax benefits is a big deal yeah it's huge deal I mean we talk about it in our tax workshop and I show people how to do this and\nBasically what you are eligible to do is pull their stock out of the four one K. and just put it in a normal brokerage account now than I already brokerage account just like a normal brokerage accounts after tax\nSo some things that some things happen when you do that as you do how to pay tax on your basis but the grows can be deferred and when you do sell that stock it's taxed at long term capital gains rates not ordinary income which we know that those brackets are less than ordinary income for a lot of folks in fact\nUm do you remember what they are\nWhat the capital game yeah I Know that it's zero Fifteen and twenty percent\nYou yeah there you go you got it right I don't understand who get zero gets Fifteen or to get someone who's so they have certain income ranges okay but um but why do you have\nYou been different all that money into that for all and K into your employer stuck will use ... example and it's grown up in Russia Today at a pretty good day and it looks looks pretty good of the other day a dead um\nWhat if you could pay ordinary and cap only on the amount of you put in so let's say I put in a hundred grand into the points to track okay in a group of five hundred thousand\nWhy gotta I gotta pay tax on the hundred as ordinary income and she's going to add to my normal income with the different growth can stay inside that brokerage account and I don't have to be taxed on but when I Do I have to pull it out and I have to be tax but what if I can figure out a way to sell that Boeing stock and not pay tax on it\n[noise] okay now I've seen you go through this after tax seminar I've seen the ... the people turn white as a ghost when they are they're like wait a minute this is me and I just did it wrong\nBut you you and you talk and I've tried to explain this to other people like hey wait a minute hold on a second and have tried to explain to him and I've done it all wrong it is somewhat confusing but what do most people just take it out of their four O. one K. and turn it into\nWise if we are at St Louis do blame carbon university city originally Manchester would\nOkay [noise] [noise]\nI'm able to

of mortgages that they have been buying so for instance uh actually brought a statistic in a\nWay of two thousand to Fifteen they were they bought like the million and a half a million and a half mortgages now they're buying one and a quarter million mortgages\nSo\nIt's very simple concept you can go in and be the brightest ball but in the party when the fed which is brand new ... Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nWhen they buy mortgages rates go down when they slow down barring mark and buying mortgage rates go up and they've decided to slow it down and you say well why why why why why\nI don't know I don't even care you know me I care about what the rules are wants to know what the rules are white things do what they do\nYou know we can\nWe can argue a bottom all we want but the dang rules and that's how it is\nSpanish not buying as many mortgages consequently interest rates are slightly edging up now let's see look at his\nConforming loan to be a loan or be a loan is a four point eight seven five it was a four point five\nFour point eight seven five it was four point five\nOkay so it went up three a separate point two years ago it was four point zero\nSo in two and a half years it's went up three quarters of a point by point actually seven eight to a point where am I to de ...\n[laughter] I better quit talking before I continue to sound stupid but I think I've already passed that test ... that's all right this was this week in real estate Naim Terry Hall and I am your real estate authority\n[noise] [noise]\nI don't know\nGreat artist illness and whether you make two album maybe\nAny um dived into religion which I have no objection to I Do [noise]\nWhat a great artist sketch Stephen Tate let's go to an email um you want to talk to me three well before nine six dimes five eight seven seven that's nine six nine five eight seven seven ... ... email me\nInfo I.

I wouldn't send them a check for anything\nJust see we're dose who knows who knows how screwed up that might be\nHe may end up with Eighteen thousand dollars because they've collected too much money however what he definitely wants to do is wait till he gets a full explanation of this I get it I Know what they did [noise] I just deposit money and watch for the letters and see what happens\nIt's\nPretty simple ... not bragging law not doing anything illegal he's waiting for them to get it to get there how about getting together let's give away free access to the MLS [noise]\nYou're searching for property is a thing called the MLS which is what real ...

months or nine six nine five eight seven seven and nine six nine five eight seven seven so [noise]\nUm [noise] here's a house for sale okay and we're looking at the different\nWays to market it\nSo I went in and I found out on this particular house I'm Seventy nine clients had put it into their portal which means they liked it\nThirty four of them put it is one of their favorites it was sent out June Ninety people through an automatic email one of the things when you got to understand when you are listening a piece of property\nYou are the boss\nThe agent is the employing e sometimes we forget about that whole town because you are the boss mhm\nAnd the agency employee and what you need is the boss is regular information on what's being done with your house what kind of open houses you're having what eighth or none what kind of views have been on the computer what kind of context of the realtors had with you one of the showings been all about\nYou have to have that information from your realtor good or bad information it doesn't matter so that you can make good decisions about what to do with your home I was talking to a lady\nThere has been on the market for four and a half months and she\nCalled ... which by the way I've only got two of them left nine six nine five eight seven seven and I did a CNA for her and we sat\nDown and talked about the fact that uh in the locations of the property was\nThat the list price they had was at least at least forty thousand dollars more than what properties we're selling far in that region and the region have changed in ownership and um and that they were going to have to adjust their price\nTo fit the condition\nOf the neighborhood it is it's present time because ah\nYour house is subject to what everybody in the neighborhood does did there's you can have the greatest home in the world and if nobody around you takes care of their the value of your home is going to go down dramatically regardless of your efforts to keep your property\nAt the top of the market pretty simple\n\nSo I went to see this lady in the end and I said well what's happening is when you're forty thousand dollars over market\nPeople are coming to look into Europe people that are looking at your house\nBecause it's in their price range walk in and then they go to other homes that are priced similarly and they buy the other homes because compared to your home\nNow their homes have a lot more to offer because they're priced right near\nI met another lady that uh um\nFor months four hundred thousand dollars she even told the agent at the age and hit the priced too high in ... ah I beat the pro well\nAnd then than than than I\nBeat the pro well the action made a mistake and they just lost the entire summer they're going to move they want to go to where it's warm either California or they're going to the ocean or or or the east coast or Myrtle Beach somewhere around there\nIt's gonna be nicer winters than in Missouri and they may have to stay the rest of the winner here because the edge and to get gas sold well\nWhen you're asked is up for sale you need rather than the regular interaction with your realtor and your real two needs to provide you regular information about what's going on with the property even if it's not great information okay All right it's information because\nYou know it's a whole lot of realtors looking at your house on line nobody's showing it that says they don't think that it's worth the money\nIt's all a lot of people are looking online at your house and they don't want to see it that means for the money that you're asking they don't see the value All right\nYou have to know this is the seller so that you can make good decisions about what to do some of those decisions maybe you know I went out to see a dime you used to discount broker\nAnd uh he's got a beautiful home and it\nStarted out thirty thousand dollars above what it should have been and he sat down with me and he said well how am I going to tell my wife that\nSaid well here they ... they don't lie\nAnd the fact of the matter is what you're trying to do is get as much money for your home as one of similar size that has either a pool or a professionally finished lower level or a three car garage instead of a two car garage\nSo you may personally feel that your house is worth that much but let me tell you want\nWhen you're asked has been on the market for four months the markets not agreeing with you\nThat the that doesn't mean the markets right or wrong but it but what it does say is the market as a whole is saying\nYou're asking too much and I said you you you\nYou are a and you know I don't like telling people that they got to reduce their price I like everybody getting the most money they can but I have a job to my employers who are ... who are the people that are in me to sell their home\nAnd that's tell him the best information so that they can do the best decision making they can so I have to be the bearer of bad news than I Am the bearer of bad news gosh who wants to have that job\n\nAs to why we are at St Louis hallway Arnold country\nOn ABC News update

me today one of them is march scenic Gunter she is the director of public relations and volunteering and all around Jack of all trades and I have ... Jackson who is a volunteer in the\n... and she's going to talk to us about whole house and of course I've got me I've got you and then just a moment we are going to interview [noise]\nYeah the miracles how do you like that trying to remember them they're the ones that made the song\nTears of a clown oh yeah the track so my tears love machine that they're going to be a hosting a concert for the veterans on December the\n... November the eleventh see I sit in march ... is a Jack of all trades now she's a radio personality you keeps me in line that is a difficult job hey if you want to talk to us today don't do it you know because we want to interview the miracles\nThey do concerts for veterans around the country I Can't I Can't begin to say what I\nWould like to say they want to get to say that to them on the air and you're going to probably shared won't you but after we get done with that kind of the that interview 'em you want to talk to us three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven so we're gonna talk about\nBowling tearing we're going to talk about whole health we're going to talk with the miracles we're going to talk about eligibility how you get started using the ... be a benefit snakes you've\nEarned this was the new VA that strike\nI Can't begin to tell you the difference between the old B a and the new BA it's like night and day I Can't so for instance for instance\nMy eyes were bothering me and I had a a a a an apartment\nWhere I go in every three months because I've had cancer in my neck\nAnd they stick this camera down my nose and do all of this crazy stuff and it always comes back out and says oh you're wonderful Wendy way I got there early and I thought you know my eyes tremendous new set of contacts has really been bothering me so I walked into the clinic\nAnd there was a guy you know what the man their mouths are linked a quarter to eight or something and I told him to my contact was bothering me ever since I got my new set and he asked me for my last name and my last four used to sit down we'll have somebody see you in about ten minutes\nNo kidding [noise] ten minutes later I have an optometrist who said that er ophthalmologist I don't know which they are both in the business I think yeah\nYou did see an optometrist\nAn optometrist as I said that's marched in a gun to the Jack of all trades now she's a radio personality fixing may anyway you're kind of ...\nFor forty five minutes so I had to call back I had to call up on my cell phone to tell the people that were going to stick the camera down my throat that I was going to be a little late which of course um I didn't mind being a little late for that one [noise] um they kicked up my eyes they found there was an infection\nThat gave me some drops told me to come back in the week and that's what the new VA is all about it's what it's all about it's so improved and that's what this program is all about\nSo sort of cherry can I just tell you a little bit yeah I didn't do that all the time get all the time I'll go ahead anyway this is Marcy and against her so it is yes but uh yeah so one of the things that I think you and I kept a little bit about it is I'm On I'm On line scheduling\nSo if you don't want to just walk\nInto for clinics like the clinic and put diet street I mean we're back where you can do it just like the private sector so why don't you just call in or just go to my healthy that\nAnd then scheduling appointments there as opposed to the old VA were you had to go to your primary care doctor right at times solved over to the Icelandic and I so I think there are small changes that we are making that are making large differences in\nHow easy more convenient it is for veterans to get that\nNominee interrupt you because the miracles are on the phone on
