knew very well is when Sidney Solomon\nWas at the helm of things 'cause he and dad were they were friends in we'd go out to the farm and hang out in the pool and I'd hang out with his kids so I knew that family but you look at the lower reasons some of the other piano hands jackets and she and her hands I didn't get that close to but they seem like on the surface\nAll very different personalities how would that trickled down to a player did that change things much for you\nHe did John I mean I I really I mean when you look at it I mean there's but eight different ownership group so that was a sense I care and that's all there's been there's been a cause I was here last year the salt before they see the ... so yeah it's changed I mean I I think when you look at\nWhat goes on with the with the ownership group I mean the the group that we have right now is is that is their study buddy they're trying to win a Stanley Cup and everybody is aware of that and they've been very vocal about what they're trying to do here say all those but uh do you go back to the euro with\nA hurry or ... things were were a lot different than all the major effect on a ship even I'm going to solve it is

the kill much better team are very very quickly with it well France is at the helm was he was able to\nMake trade and spend money and so yeah it it it has a huge effect on who you're trying to play for the ownership is is very very involved in the war he was spent more money\nPlay for the ownership is is very very involved in the war he would spend more money I think that any body else a try to win to John told us this last do Marcia where we have now so it it it changes from ownership the ownership and certainly a when they want to spend money it it's a it's a bigger effect for the

General Robert would he was in the United states military\nAnd was a procurement officer for uh the Panama Canal projects so if anybody understood the intricacies of global supply and demand it was this guy\nAnd in the early Nineteen twenties\nHe saw the automobile was going to be a huge factor in changing the way that Americans shop and he was going to the executives at Montgomery Ward where he worked at the time\nWas saying look we really need to go into retail and the executives at ward said you know we don't want to hear anything about that we were going to stick with what made us a mail order and eventually fired Robert would because he just wouldn't let up on this idea of retail stores and so uh the day he was fired he went directly to uh to Sears, Roebuck\nWhich at that point was under the direction of a man named Julius Rosenthal who's really considered sort of the progressive of the company and Roosevelt understood that this guy was a genius and hired him immediately in

you also look at things like wait a minute to discover card out all the insurance\n... they were huge a interestingly enough Sears was actually head of the curve when it came to the world Wide Web I'm\nA Sears work directly with IBM and the late eighties and early nineties uh to get a Internet service of of sorts it was called prodigy\nA they actually piloted the prodigy program here in Atlanta and Hartford, Connecticut and San Francisco and uh I always sort of say\nThey they put all their eggs in sort of the beta max basket they invested millions in this program and by Nineteen Ninety five Ninety six had been surpassed by America on line and Internet Explorer because\nThey were a little more user friendly I think but uh yeah Sears cheers had a lot of interesting things that they were doing at that time some people say that that was\nShe had a lot of interesting things that they were doing at that time some people say that that was part of their downfall as well\nAre still involvement does discover end of all the companies\nAll their separate entities now Sears just sort of help get them off the ground but um [noise] you know I I've spoken with a number of retirees who say you know in the seventies and eighties which many of us consider the pinnacle of the company a lot of them are retirees who are workers shoes at the time so that was really where they started to lose touch with their their working class roots\nUri all state insurance named after a tire that's you\nKnow it was actually made an actress Mississippi at one point they they that was one of the first plant fears helped to bring to the south that was another thing that Sears did\nFor the southern region was as they came down and and invested heavily in industry and are at contracts with factories around the region like the uh the tire plant nachos where you know they were not only supporting farmers but also expanding and industry\nClearly you love to see her as well and then what [laughter] what sparked this fascination with seniors\nWell much like you guys I mean I grew up in the Nineteen seventies and and the rural south and\nAnd I was an only child so that makes me a little special I spend a lot of hours with that catalogue and and you know by the Nineteen eighties the economy improves and we all start going and shopping and the brick and mortar stores and and almost forgot about fears and when I went back to college\nI was sort of shocked as you read through a particularly southern literature and history this constant\nMention of fears is this an integral part of southern culture and I'm like wait a minute this companies from Chicago\nHow did this happen and so I decided to sort of dive into it and\nLet me tell you it's been it's been one heck of a rabbit hole\nOr you're going to become a historian on Wal Mart now that it was on her made their bed\nAnd again you know we mentioned this earlier and I just missed it because I didn't believe there was this huge thing but somebody texted is a ... animals a serious thing\nI'm not sure if that was the Sears brand or not I know skins was and I know that I had some gr animals you know you match the tag\nI'm wearing them now you\nGot a job and it got to make it to be on the website out that people want to go down memory lane on line\nI actually I don't know you can find me a jury a jury underscore Hancock at Yahoo dot com um but other than that yeah yeah I I as a public school teacher I have a lot of time or resources or anything like that 'cause it's it's pretty demanding job\nBegging for making time for us we pay to appreciate your ideal meal\nAnd I forget sometimes that the Sears Tower yeah the Old Spice years\nI mean this guy is obsessed with ... that it's like you think he brings that up on dates\nI'm not sure he has a lot of those I don't know if you could be a married guy\nHe's he was a nice guy was a nice guy like upset and he got a chance to chat ... I'd be interested to see if anybody's selling one of the old Sears catalogs\nAnd and what they're going for I mean they've been gone for a while like we should buy it and send it to this guy might send them into or drive man he is home might be made them already got them home ... years used to sell houses\nI'm home now and a lot of these how they'll banker right are still standing lands and was this here's a thing to well if you own a home if you're buying food goes she's here comes something I can only lead\nAnd you need to get your carpets cleaned and I'm just ... years didn't do that is a true clean carpet spot I think maybe you could rent one of those ... may be you don't want to know that when you can have the green stuff now when you could have a different green organic pre spray on\nTrade he asked they don't use shampoos no residue is left in the carpet to re attract dirt it's true\nClean carpet and I'm telling you call these people and this is you I use\nTo clean the carpets in my home and I'm pretty per se ... when it comes to my ...\nRight now to Glenn carpet is offering this value that you won't believe you're going to think I'm renting it wrong chances are good that I Am writing it wrong but I Know I'm not look up ... on the jury room special Harvard cleaning protest one hundred and thirty nine dollars I don't know how to spell it\nFor rooms of carpets cleaned for one hundred and thirty nine dollars and when you mentioned my name's Julie Bach you get to room Scott scarred protected or pet owner treated for free these carpets are\n... going to happen I Will get to a legal stuff will start at one of the stupid question John largely known for these um I saw a story you spend a week or so ago I'm\nOn Facebook about a guy who had committed a crime in a pretty serious crime I don't remember exactly what it was\nUm but there was reward offered for information leading to the rent and you see that quite often you know thirty five thousand dollars offered to information leading to the rent so there was a story that the guy who committed the crime\nOh there was a story that the guy who committed the crime seriously considered turning themselves in show he did collect thirty five thousand dollars or whatever it was and I thought you know why\nWhy why couldn't you do that because basically saying I'm your guy he's pretty damn good information into getting your man\nI think it's great [laughter] it's it's so funny you can't believe is you can't make this stuff up\nNo so did he get the money does he get the money\nWell you know he's not going to get the money\nHe got his son in law were you benefit from your own ... and you know they're not\nGoing to reward him for bad behavior but I'm\nNot as much as I Do not get anything\nThough he's not going to get it um you know I mean you know they're not gonna pay 'em I think it's a great way to do it I Hope it happens more often\nYeah well I just like I Love the stories of the police departments and a note to people that have more and saying hey congratulations you want a new flat screen TV and then he'll come pick it up to twenty two eighty five dollar but this Saturday\nBetween five and then we'll give you your TV and behind the building there's the budget squad cars and budget people with in God's in is these people come in are you Mr John ... science or\nHow Bo yes okay that you know we uh side warrants out here as for parking tickets please the officer so and so you know television they are just ... to the pokey\nYeah they don't even get a TV in the ...\nYou know you don't get a TV but isn't that entrapment I mean I wasn't one of my schedule questions for you but what about that situation\nNo that's actually not entrapment because you're not trying to lure them into breaking the law [noise] um it might be you could call it deceitful you know your your but um if not entrapment entrapment would be to encourage you to actually break the law what\nCan they still get out of it because they were brought in under false pretenses\nNo they they get a brand new pair of Greece located\nJust go to jail alright so I'm gonna I'm just going to play to save and buy all my TVs\nRight okay go to Best Buy All right good to know\nBut you know a whole right everyone's got lottery madness talk about that\nA ... eight hundred million or more than that and you know the legal question becomes say it's you and not do that it's going to happen any of his sadly\nBut is it is let's talk about how you get your ducks in a row and some people that say how many to twenty five year pay off where you give me thirty nine million a year or I Want to be three hundred million right now and take what you needs why do people believe in\nI Want to spread it out why not give me the money All right now and I'll do something else with it why the option even there\nWell I I think it depends on your age and tax consequences um but I think a lot of people will say the first thing you need to do is call a lawyer and I I think that's not that's not a bad idea I think you're more to do than that I think you want to call a financial advisor\nOr you may want to call a lawyer for a state planning reasons because you know now you do have a large estate assets they're going to have to determine what's gonna happen to them once you pass\nAnd I think the other thing you really want to look into as asset protection a once you're given that kind of money but whether you take it for twenty five years or a lump sum I think there's tax consequences there or you might want to look into and a financial advisor may may be the right person to talk to\nNearly cos\nYou always can call lawyer especially if it's me and you want to share\nYeah yeah I mean yeah that's always a good idea and it did say you've got five kids you knew when you want to get the money to them without them getting smacked with tax consequences I Know you're not a tax attorney\nBut is there a way that they can be awarded some of that cash to directly or did you have to go to you and then you get to do my twenty grand a year or\nWhatever I minored in it as it may you know\nThey're going to first give it to you okay because I don't think the lottery of their agreements not to give it to others but surely going to give it to you but then you can gifted and then there are there's other means other ways to transfer\nHe may put it into a trust and then there's different types of trust that they can either have control over it immediately or later on so you know what if you're going to get eight hundred million dollars I think you're going to want to get some advisors and consultants or talk to them before you take that back\nOr the drones on friday on Saturday mornings now for the story on the legal that's making all the news internationally now at this point is the girl downtown and the law to wouldn't let the black guy in the building because she didn't know if the necessarily lived there and he\nSaid I live here and and kind of\nAnd he was filming her while she was all happening so we've all seen the tape or among the most\nWas seeing the tape we kind of heard the story what is the legal stunk here I mean it's it's not a stand your ground because you know the castle doctrine said you know somebody comes into my house I have all the rights in the world to do whatever I Want to them but what if they live in the same building thinking I'm an area where there's a ... yeah\nRight so you're the stand your ground or should not apply in a common area that would be more on your own apartment your own home you you may be able to use that some people are trying to use it in their cars other place of business [noise]\nUm so I think that would be an issue if it's if in one of those but in the common area really [noise] um it's it's not that wasn't were was designed to be use you may still attempt to use it there because really what stand your ground does\nIf it's just a burden shifting it used to be before stand your ground I suppose it was me I could use um the defense of self defense\nTo the ... you know why I don't even want to use it for myself to say I killed somebody but let's do it for the hypothetical but they were accusing me of murder I could say well I was um it was self defense so it's justified\nBut what they did was stand your ground as they shift the burden of proving\nSo now the state or the prosecutor has the burden of proving that it was something other than self defense or the presumption is that if I'm at home and I would shoot somebody that it was self defense now the state has to come in there and say no no it was in self defense\nSo even if it's in a common area I guess you could use that\nUm that defense and and shift the burden to the state but we don't think it's going to hold up and certainly not in this case where there was a video I'm ... and this is one where I when I saw it on TV the first thing I thought it was oh my God where is this is this New Yorker where is this a long behold I realized it was St Louis\nAnd so it actually happens here too\nYeah that type setting that that happened the way it did and then she ended up losing her job she\n[noise] yeah I don't know that I feel sorry for her losing her job but she didn't lose her job\nAnd they fire you for that even though that had nothing to do with the working hand yeah\nYeah that's a that's a great question and so the answer would be if they're if if she was working under some type of ...", "show_name": "The Carney Show", "year": "2018", "city":
