...\nThe movie looks great and especially when you when you know that the budget for the film was thirty six million dollars which is not a lot of that one out a lot and I know it's not it's not a lot of money at all especially for a movie with that deep of a bench from a caliber standpoint and then also with um but just\nThat many like location shots and a lot of those music scene there were crashing preexisting concert festival how that was really it was so I tend to I think we've done in one take like the opening shot they had ten minutes at the I think stage coach festival if they were like you got that but it was and they walked on stage they did their thing and they walked off\nWow and people probably really loved it yeah when they realized too it was yeah I'm sure at first they were like one way or you know people like people they\nPulled out of the crowd and um and I always you know I thought it was interesting that\nOnly one time was an I Love you live in a way in that movie and that's when they first went on stage he said I Love you remember us like this and then uh gosh about moving to he didn't say it back and women they never said it again in the movie yeah but you knew that they were in love because of greed\nRight up with all his BS yeah put up with a lot of stuff you know I Know yeah [laughter] exactly [laughter] I'm like this woman last name is on a\nOne of the news stations and she was interviewing a priest a that was\nIn the storms in Florida and he said God Bless you and she started at the end of the interview and she started to say God Bless you but then she stopped or south I guess because she was on the news station insurance and will stay in touch like that and it does that it's like why can't you just say something nice back to somebody I don't know\nIt's like when you meet somebody you're like you'd go check their hands and you're like oh we're hugging\nHim right now we're ... or ...\nI was like when I go to the movies and they take my ticket and they say enjoyed the film and I said you do your oh wait a minute we're up here I heard that you do you two weeks or so there were other movies that came out alerts yeah they are still continuing to make new\nProducts are they should just shut it all down by burning down have you done it with their started\nArne Mets movie in the past ten years that's what you said if that's what I said so I Will be going back to the movie theaters to see a star is born again a but there are other new movies coming out and there's there's first ran right back feel like that's the big one\nYet

Johanson is going to be in a standalone black widow moving back in the marvel comic book universe and she's getting Fifteen million dollars for that million which I don't know if that is a\nIf that's Robert Downey junior Iron Man money new but That's Chris Evans that's a Sam's worth for for you that it's in line with some of the other women who've been making bank on these more of a movie so I don't think\nAny of the other men in the franchise are at the same level of importance to the franchise as Robert Downey junior is so I like to me that would just be about you know true one to one ratio do you know who do you need more to move this franchise forward um\nBut if she's making money on par with what the ... or something that seems more than equitable to me here so it's good to finally see that the women are making their money and\nAh there was a list that came out that ah you know they say women make what Seventy five cents on the dollar per hour and yeah it was like the um the state of Vermont is the best in the country\nAnd women are still only making Ninety cents on the dollar has meant and that's the best yeah yeah uh it won't be the best until it's\nA dollar on every dollar but uh it's good to see that scarlet your Hansing in Hollywood is finally making some bank and get the money that you do that you mentioned in his first movie that uh they do a lot of close ups and and you didn't get to see some of the space action that you wanted to see\nRight that might have had to do with budget [noise] I don't know like I got to think this guy's coming off la

a guardian them guardians of the galaxy he's trying to do like a rocket in space to the moon like\nThat's that seems like\nI mean I Know it's easier said than done but that seems like fairly rudimentary stuff where they have some graduate I can do right and we're doing that in the seventies Star Wars I thought you were actually on a sound stage\nI can say with the tea I I don't know okay\nUm but I've got a list of certain scenes in movies and TV shows that they only came about because they had a lack of money one of the most famous ones Monty Python and the and the search for the holy grail right or they couldn't afford horses which is why we got the coconuts pacify I'm Larry for\nWhen you go back and look at what Steven Spielberg dead with the job right and I was the first thing that came to my my own yeah it was just it looks so but it looks so low budget now when you see it like if you go on one of those tours of yeah ... or something but they made it work ahead and they share made it scary is that as you\nAre in the purge which is about Ethan Hawke are defending his house from people that you know one day a year you know whoever you weren't supposed to take place in the whole city\nBut they realized we don't have the budget for that so it only took place in the house and that's the best one of the franchise library or in the first rocky they went ice
