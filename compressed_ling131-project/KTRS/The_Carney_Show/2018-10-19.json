five there a girl a memoir of growing up Bernstein an interesting conversation\nFor all of us to have as it includes jak box daughter Julie boxes co host of the show and me who I think not entirely proven the son of radio broadcaster jak Carney so all of us\nAre coming to you live from Mr really sizeable shadow Jamie welcome to the program\nThank you very much like\nI've never written a book about my father and I don't\nThink Julie has either but people feel compelled to come up and share stories all the time so we really are an extended family more than what you would find on a genealogy tree but an actually putting pen to paper and writing that life down\nTalk about that the kids started aspect of that and and did it bring you closer did you learn more about your relationship with him\nBut well I I had to remarkable dad Leonard Bernstein was so many things he wasn't\nA concurrent he was a composer so many different kinds of music you know something needs and Broadway shows them that way as an opera but he was also a conductor and it was also an educator and so many people who grew up watching him during his young people's concert\nOn TV with the New York philharmonic so became really a kind of a national TV uh taught many generations about music and what was fun about it and went with beautiful about it and we just had a natural\nAh come home to get [noise] um so he was all those things are lifelong humanitarian and activists so you kind of a Canadian guy to talk about and learn about and it was a pretty interesting guy to grow up too so I really wanted to share\nThat we love my many stories and memory about growing up in my remarkable family\nAnd what where they're at risk of sounding like fishes syrup police action\nShould those last than had parents in high demand and certainly you're popped right up there with everything you did and all the traveling and projects and things were sacrifices made by um\nWithout our choice if they just weren't really around all that much because they were doing so many things you were so important just so many people and I think they're for all of us that it's a hard thing to get right with some point\nIt's true that my father was off and on the road conducting in other countries and other cities\nBut when he went home he was really home or he didn't have a nine to five job so ours were unpredictable and he was often around and you know hanging out with my siblings and myself\nHe really enjoyed our company I never felt unwelcome and as president and so when we had him there we we really had a ... a pretty fair trade\nUsually I feel like that's not the case you know somebody in that level of talent or that they don't come back and that they're that they're not present even if they're there you know what I'm saying\nThat can happen but he\nHappened to him or his family and spending time with her and my mother and you can look at look at who is from South America humid our whole whole environment and in writing and ... and that I'm not only did my father had a great environment\nTo experience family but a friend and rest of the family always wanted to be over at our house 'cause it was a play or how people all the crime and people\nI bet some amazing people right they knew wouldn't ... most people would never imagine a meaning right\nExactly and you know when you're a little kid your family your family and their friends or just for friends and you don't have any frame of reference right for whether they're important or well known or anything like that they're just the people who happened to be around so only in retrospect\nDid I realize that it was quite remarkable that my parents were in absolute\nEpicenter of a comfortable life in New York City and the twentieth century and the amazing people were coming over to the health musicians and actor and writer in order and you know a ... amazing people including\nMany of my father's collaborators like the time and drum Robbins and\nI'm On the list goes on and then I\nCan't remember who I was talking to but to the point do you just need somebody told me in passing during an interview that Frank Sinatra would come over and swimming pool on the weekends and I just stop 'em and say you know that hasn't happened to most of us [laughter]\nI mean that doesn't happen either by the way\nWe didn't have that experience but like Julie ...\nIn that doesn't happen to either by the way\nWe didn't have that experience like Julie sitting in front of a microphone like her father did me as well so do you own a conductors John have you written some music do you perform\nWell I mean you can find out the answer to a lot of those questions in my book because it is very much about my own experience of music and how I eventually made my piece with music because I didn't try for a while to be a singer songwriter but I was always an agony\nA comparison here and I was\nDriving myself crazy so uh when I did finally set it aside I turned into a much calmer\nPerson [laughter] maybe that's what I Do maybe that is what you need to do what's most surprising aspect of your childhood do you think for people when they read the book\nThe most uprising maybe the most surprising thing for most people is that uh my parents were real warm and accessible and fun to be around and you're like you know people who see\nMy father's videos and photographs of him as a conductor and ... and his ... anywhere they can even look very kind of forgetting and Syria and Iran maybe a little scary and the kid actually\nBut and they look like the the sort of like the\nGuy that he actually was and what so much fun to be around when he would you know it kind of a joke to fight for Lewis Carroll and sing the song what can you know he was really a a fantastic character and uh you know a really fun in person to have for a father\nYou know the trade off when you've got someone not seem as as a piano for you some incredible opportunities to meet some people that are\nUnder Lee amazing um but the downside is there's no climate aspect to one's life and it's no secret that your father\nWas bisexual and they had love the stairs with men and you talked about mom making your home kind of my sons special place\nI Would think that added a bit of a challenge to to make things normal especially in\nA time in American history where that was not\nThat's correct and you know every family has its ups and downs but in a family like ours where we had this larger than life\nPerson in the middle of it it just made all the upper and lower down down or if you know what I mean and and certainly my father is complicated sexuality was a challenge for all of us\nUm when it finally became evident to one [laughter] which didn't happen until I was in my late teens before that I really had no idea\nUm and so this was something that I had to grapple with as a young adult and so did my brother and sister later on\nAnd how about your mom geez I mean again\nI mean you can imagine it was a very tough word for her but she chose that road they both chose that road with their eyes wide open which we found out only recently when a letter surfaced from\nA mom to our dad a written test around the time they got married in which he said look I I Know we're all day and we are doing each other and we want to have a family and

Lindsey with what's going on um\nI don't think I think I think it's more that he just didn't want to he wasn't going to go on a tour right it wasn't a question of fire it just because he was like no I'm not going so everybody else wanted to tour and and they tried to get him involved but he didn't want to show to make for somebody\nElse in this place or to other people whatever [noise] but anyway it was the Mac thing was sort of where the problem with the Mac thing was we as we did it ... at least what I was with them for two years as we did an album\nIt took forever to do call time I'm Christine ... was part of it but she would not go on the road\nA and on top of your old Warner Brothers didn't promote the album so basically it was a\n[laughter] ... you know we were not just shows around the America and Europe um and it was sort of it's sort of like a Fleetwood Mac cover band\nAnd I would say to if you want to be an authentic Fleetwood member of a and not think member Fleetwood Mac you have to have an affair with at least two of the members\n[laughter]\nYou know at least a and the way it's a it portrayed in some of the sky graffiti\nSpecials about around the rumors period track neither a historic band you would have been tied ... official original member a traffic and then leaving the band and then going back to you still work with some of those guys do you do you uh revisit that at all\nWhether it's only myself from one more to live\nThe way he really ... yeah\nNobody called me yep and teams had to use the Wynwood worked together at all\nEasy a while when you bring that up to me I always say you're you're you're asking the wrong guy okay\nAll right we get it plain taken I Love you rock stars you so much fun\nYou're asking the wrong guy I mean you know the fact is traffic we're here with me and him would be awesome\nBut\nI'll put it in a call for the call\nHuh I see a number that can do the new for me it brings you to town that comes up on Tuesday river city casino and I know that there's going to be stories in some slides and I love that as opposed to here's one song here's another song we\nWant details behind a Detroit would just be you are you going to bring a backing band with you\nKnow I found\nOkay no I didn't know I Do is you have to tie it\nWorks so I don't do that I I I did on plus years ago probably was\nI don't do that I I I did four years ago we were first for the garden do it with Jim Krieger we'd get a bunch of years ago\nYeah well I heard that Christie him if he was going to be part of it but she didn't want to travel probably there's\nSome comedy in their head a new material I from you that we get our hands on\nAs their new stuff new day losing\nTheir art is putting new material which is from time to exercise in futility at this point\nYeah well if you do I promise to buy one so therefore I mean I I I\nI put things together but they're only available that shows that there's no way there's no way to promote or sell 'em music any more\nWhen they will come to the show how's that you come to the show exactly that's what I Do live that's what we'll do will be there or we will come to the show on Tuesday

kind of a slow talker well you didn't\nSay I have to ask him I don't have one word I don't the entire time I don't really to me you're a musician I feel like I back off because we're the musician I would've thought your chimed in his day kind of a hug you\nKnow you kind of ... kind of a hog ... yeah I he's not the friendliest Sunday Times now sometimes is job be earn your money\nTalking to me like that like to be like us going in trying to sing sometimes but some of them are so animated mine but he didn't like watching TV or scientists ticked off yeah he does\nA mid ... maybe show well we'll throw some stuff that you but the guy's been responsible for some amazing music so right you know I don't want to be his friend the guys give us some great songs I'll take that\nI mean he's right someone like gave me sing and I hate to say this and I already hung up on him so he's not listening to us and you don't know that he puts out new music no one's buying that come on\nI ... a lot most ... right but you know ... hurting you'd want to go to the to hear stuff that he didn't care for that you know and like I don't I went to see prince one time\nAnd he played on the new stuff and I hated it because I wanted to hear all the classic stuff that's why I went to branch out he's dead now so how do you feel about that\n... that again that's unfortunate yeah he killed him what how did that that he heard Julie box was not pleased with the concerts I'd read whereas what I thought I went back to Paisley Park and took a bunch of stuff to drought is sorrows slap yeah [noise]\nUh so do you want to go see did Mason with me now is your ideal yeah I'd love to go\nYou what I'd love to go to you like to hear the new stuff I like no he plays the news of I'm leaving I'm going to say that she does he know that John guardians not pleased with the new stuff I Do now I haven't read the news stuff that I Do that but it's only going to be able to show well nobody nobody buys music\nAnymore in the traditional sense and least of all are buying big Mason\nFinals coming back yeah ... and ... you know you you just got new vinyl what'd you get what Jacqueline three okay\nYou didn't get the new tracks from Dave mates and ... you know read the rebuilding of traffic there not out\nDid anybody by the new uh Fleetwood Mac album\nOr I or against American sound effect now I'm rustic Philips has copyright on now he does he had to walk out of some we love our nostalgia I Would bet to that's probably why\nMichael Dell Pedro who's open up a town of restaurants opened up the aisle ph rose on big band including road because of are interested in is the algae and it was that original restaurant on Hampton\nThat everybody went to\nThat Michael and Mary ... opened up which they've gotten all the records out and replace it with finding food thanks for your help\nI told your hat [laughter] bottom shelf ah where it was like oh yeah ...\nAh the old days the I'll be a Trojan at ten fifty nine south big than what they did was not introduce some of the stuff that's a popular it ... goes your civil or some of his other spots they have gone\nWay back in his early end of the day may shouldn't catalog and brought you the Italian dishes of traffic days\nA disadvantage patties something you don't see it other Italian places because it was big then but you know what people are enjoying it and now they're ... pet day is going to go or the salad of course which is\nA jolly box favorite love it you just stay out of this entirely John my favorite too they have pastas they have stakes\nBecause it was a movie it was an old theater on ... what if\nAny of these movies could you go to this movie and get what's going on I let you go\nI mean up all you really need to know is that forty years ago Jamie Lee Curtis this character was attacked by then I called my Michael Meyers he killed a bunch of people and he's been in a mental asylum ever since\nAnd now he's got ill fingernails who wears a sweater that orange and ... you know that's Freddie Mac's East that their hand I Know there's one where she is attacked by little dog that comes to live\nFact checking in stabbed during the knee and Iraqi\n... Chuck even love such house play\nAh okay well I Know nothing about this and so I mean I that's I mean that's pretty much the patrol so they're they're trying to go back to their roots and so she so now we pick up forty years later and and Jamie Lee Curtis this character Laurie Strode is is uh I'm practically like a survivalist she's been\nHoled up in a house that she's kinda rigged with all sorts of safety devices and she's trained herself and weaponry and she's waiting for the day she gets a second chance and then and then\nShe got a chance to ask you a gory movie if she didn't get a second chance really at around at around ... through better homes and gardens sharpening a knife flick it would be\nBoring and so um and she has a daughter that she is a strange from 'cause the daughter grew up in this kind of like you know survival is compound type of life and it was miserable and his broke off on her own and then of course now there's also a granddaughter so you have three generation of strode girls for Michael to cost\n... CIA terrorize he does yes can you give us a body count I'm ... I'm thinking I'm about what I was keeping scored first I'd say it was probably maybe ten and that really kind of low well yeah I mean I mean it's not ours is not the flu\nCain hotter has been on the show right who was one of the Michael's okay yeah and I asked\nHim I said so he did like four or five in the movies and say what was your favorite kill and his favorite kill was a picking up a sleeping bag that had a girl in it and spinning around over his head in the smack in and get it against a tree\nWith his favorite is why I hate\nHorror movie who would enjoy pain hotter was Jason I was wondering leaving bag was because their campaign they're not there is a lake or as critical as I get the name of the camp right now I don't know how is the one where it's a country club and there's a tournament for the cat is out that's grounds keepers kind of nutty [laughter]\nOkay All right here's a real question OK flu Jamie Lee Curtis Carney kind of an inch or of this segment by talking about how old Jamie Lee Curtis that's right that's nice\nAs she ages and I know that Michael Meyers is you know beyond the grave or whatever\nRight cool you know a monster strength but he's got to be in his sixties by now yeah and I mean they do you see that Michael Meyers is older like he you don't you see him without his mask you never really get a good look at his face\nWith a cane instead of an act [laughter] throws hot soup and people Walker and his people pulled into the handicaps jazz falls off the wall [laughter] but yeah\nYou can see that he's older he got grey hair and he's balding and he's but he's still do it in a scene but like you could definitely tell that uh that yes he is also a chief been taking care of himself well you know he's been on a very strict diet and the er and\nThen kind of creepy I don't like these kind of movies I just I Know\nOf all the movies out there I like the Halloween wants the best\nYeah that is what are they back in space and there's an alien aboard the ship and they're trying to find it and it keeps going into different astronauts bodies are thinking of baseball yeah jumping out of ... do you though a Jason friday the thirteenth is there was a friday\nThere no there is a frightening is Jason was there I don't know that there was a uh my uh Halloween\nSo every teenager in St Louis will be going to see this movie tonight correct\nOr this movie is estimated to make a ton of money because uh it works on both levels now right it's an old enough move how yeah that it's gotten astounded teenagers wanna see it 'cause it's just a horror movie to shore and uh\nAnd the older people want to see it 'cause they I mean they saw Halloween when it came up forty years ago and they're they're on board member when Rob Zombie took over and started making some how long do we make two of them were those any good\nUh like it's the Halloween die hards we're kind of not a fan of them I thought the first one was pretty good I thought the second one was pretty boring\nTook us out of the five not that time and when she gave this movie I'd\nGive it three and a half like it was probably ... active I mean it starts off a little slow but when it finally ramps up at the end I mean it it it goes pretty gang busters so that we\nGet we don't get any of the other characters they don't cross pollinate with the other like the Freddie Jason thing are now when did I Met Sally or he was actually fairly serious\nBecause it's it does something that I thought was pretty interesting is that it kind of deals with the aftermath of something like this right like normally in a horror movie\nThe last shot as they've they've vanquished the monster and now everything's going to be okay and so now we're seeing people that even though there's never been another attack in forty years they're not okay right era and there's been real damage\nAnd so that's kind of an interesting thing like I don't feel like in a horror movies you ever really get right the whole notion of like how psychological ... that would be right for the people that made it out alive flip that city is it are rated yes one more question yeah as Donald pleasant said\nHe's been dead for died quite a while so he's not in this\nCorrect and people aren't moving out like a C G I Know they did not I guess I Need to walk that back 'cause he was my days dead people\nAre as bright as an actor don't wear plaid we have another movie when you do we do we ah what is a smaller recalled\nThe oath okay and uh it's written and directed and starring Ike Burke and hope I hope I say that right did you ever watch the movie the Mindy project\n... when he was like Morgan ... so um\nAnd uh it's it could almost work as a play it pretty much all takes place in his house over Thanksgiving and the premise is that uh the uh fictional president of the United states you can't tell 'cause I'm On the radio but I put fixture on air quotes a\nHas decided that everyone should love America so much that they shouldn't have any problem finding an oath\nTo America okay and uh you won't be penalized if you don't sign the oath however either or perks if you do and if you don't find the oath and people are gonna knock on your door and started asking you questions and the deadline to sign this oath is the day after Thanksgiving so this this uh movie takes place at Thanksgiving\nSo if it's the day after Thanksgiving so this this uh movie takes place at Thanksgiving dinner as his family is meeting for the holidays and so he is just adamantly opposed to this notion of having to sign a notes to the country that you don't have to put you pretty much better\nAnd other members of his family are in different parts of the political spectrum regard and it's just like this really\nTense movie of these people have in his argument but the thing is is also funny like it's a comedy\nBut it's also very tense and just watching these people get so worked up about these issues and you're fighting about you know what is news and what isn't news and it's it's really a fascinating film because for all of it's\nA political machine it's pretty apolitical because everybody does something in the movie at some point that is wrong or hypocritical or just makes them kind of look like in a whole ever leave the table\nDo they do it it definitely things escalate and I don't want to give too much away of course they leave the table it's Black Friday all the deals are ...\n... shopping [laughter] but uh uh but it was I it's a weird movie in that I don't know that I've ever seen a movie that is this dark and unsettling but still made me smiled so much\nBecause it was just a lot of like yeah I could see having this argument very easily and uh in it ... it made me laugh out loud it may be uncomfortable and a good way and I really really enjoyed\nThis wow wow hey when that out I Know my dad I Would probably give it like for like it's a pretty solid movie it is ... that's going to be an art house release yeah it's probably like a plaza Frontenac\nOr something but uh but ... and again it's not like a an eat your vegetables kind of movie and even though even if you hate politics like it I feel like it plays pretty straight that you can find to be anywhere on the spectrum and everybody gets a shot at\nRight now they didn't know and it is a the oath and that and Halloween couple offerings Idaho next friday I guess they're going to do the a bohemian Rhapsody yes I I haven't been to a screening in a long time but I've had that screening for next

available and other things as they pertain to hurricane Michael and first and foremost buddy I'm I'm Glad you're physically okay yeah really [laughter]\nThank you thank you yeah what we're happy we are certainly doing or you know just to be able to come back to house that was better than a lot of people out here we're thankful for that\nAs part of the upside and honestly not to sound cold and

you're right\nThey did did the people that are on the radio station I Know the radio station was blown away so did they get the insurance money do they pay like any kind of the two uh the employees while they're trying to you know sit their lives back up or how does this all work\nSo it's been pretty crazy or I can kind of walking through when we got back into account on friday you know I think we talked on Wednesday I you know as as we were at a vacuum created and\nYou know we weren't quite sure where you're coming back to where we got to back down on friday and a house we're still there everything was was good at it on our end we're on actually on Panama City beach which\nIs to the west coast where her most destruction of the hurricane came through our our studios are on the east and Panama City beach right next to Panama City and so it uh it\nIt takes some damage um and and Saturday we're trying to get to the studios and and say okay what do we need to do to get back on air and to get\nInformation back to the people on the radio station where we've been updated people on our social media pages through when our stations were knocked off the air but about as we're on our way to say she will get a call from our our corporate basically saying\nWe're not going to rebuild a you know though we're not trying to put the stations back on the air anymore\nSo we got there and so I don't know how many are familiar but there's a thing outside the back of our studio called STO power which is like a tower that that that sends a signal from our studios to our main transmitter tower\nRight an addict and bent and [noise] I don't know if you've seen the pictures of that that was when just spent it straight and a half\nSo but but again did you leave she was there not insurance to replace Ted wouldn't ... had been so continue to get things going again or where they kind of you know your guest on this part but might have been looking just for a way to get out\nI Would I Would I Would say it was not a secret and try to sell the stations and get out of radio and Panama City right\nUm I had been to the studios and and I believe today and our engineers believe that they were able to get facials back up on the air um a lot easier than they made it found [laughter]\nWhy not try it I mean you were in a cage yes obviously you've got a lot of jak socked away for a while I went to some save the day and it could be key Sean\nServing the emerald coast what do you think\nI think that's a great idea I'm a a great idea anyone that lottery thing yet\nBut I Do I Know you got to do the numbers first\nA guy a guy that was anybody when [noise] uh I don't mean to make a case Shawn down here\nSean you sure did they even ... can I ask that question\nYeah yeah he they well they offered us a A R R next regular paycheck and then plus thirty four so\nCan you go in there and steal the entire album collection which is what I had many wherever\nThat is showing your age a little bit there John [laughter] no album collection in our studios on and off all digital ... out of there [laughter] so what are they ...\nTo come and get everything from the building and take that back I guess there are other radio station they on another some other radio stations in the Iowa\nYeah but nobody listens to those no yeah\nSo what's your plan to get to stay on the air down there you're going to come back here and save the day when George which we can do\nReally well right now my main thing main goal is to continue updating the community through our social media bigger down here I what we've heard from our listeners are former listeners from the station in our power is on Facebook is there anything that keeps people I'm\nUp to date and aware of information right now because communication\nKeeps people I'm up to date and aware of information right now because communications are still very limited there's no real [noise] um you know regular TV I think just got back up on line but\nUm you know cell is still very spotty there's very little Internet most people don't have electric still in our area um so anything that keep people up to date in any way possible and then also anything that makes people feel a little normal\nUm yeah connected to some sense of normalcy so and just being out that we have people that send messages on Facebook and say Hi and say hey we missed talking to you guys in the morning from our morning show ordinance hearing you guys can you can you\nTell us what's going on or or share a story with us we had somebody the other day that that asked us what you would do charity songs in the morning [noise] a few times a week and said well you do want for us just to make us laugh and to make us smile we know you don't have a stage of a community one year for us on Facebook\nSo that's kind of what we're trying to do right now and that's where it focuses on you know I figure as long as you're for the next thirty days or so a minimum\nYou know we're lucky enough to have some sort of sat right at the time um and so the focus is going to still be on on keeping the community involved and not worry about what to do after that you know later\nSome kind of you know it seems to have that outlet but you know there are some people that did manage to parlay pod cast and such into fairly lucrative careers but those\nAre pretty small your Adam Corolla as your mark men are on your you know there there's a handful of others but we're seeing a turning of the tides and even with the book live and doing stuff like that you've already got obese you've got a\nYou know advertisers that are loyal to you and like what you've done for them in the past you got those listeners so what are the chances are that does show doesn't skip a beat and you stay an entity down there and the emerald coast and just changed the vehicle\n[noise] I think that's a strong possibility I think right now that is a very strong possibility and
