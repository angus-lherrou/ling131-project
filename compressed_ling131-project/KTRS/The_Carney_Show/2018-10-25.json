October ... you'll start to see she bookstores popping up all over the city living in St Louis you know she'll just committed to the communities they serve now there'll be Nineteen new book stores in neighborhoods all around town you'll also noticed that prices are\nBut the one I think has the most people upset Republicans and Democrats as it also changes how we read district in Missouri\nAnd the way we do it right now in Missouri and I've lived in other states where where it's a mess the way we do it right now in Missouri is kind of a national model\nYou get lawmakers together as a governor proves them you have these people in the room and you decide how these districts going to be set up most people are happy with that\nI'm In this it puts it actually under the auspices of the auditor the only Democrat in the state wide elected office who would then appoint somebody a state demographer to come up with the districts it has to be\nContinuous and also competitive those are the two things that has to be continuous and competitive meaning you can't draw circle here and then another circle here to gets equal representation\nThey have to be attached so we had in Florida is one district that stretched two hundred miles because the senator who lived in Jacksonville was an African American senator and she wanted her district kept in place\nSo her district was Jacksonville it came down to St john's river and looped in where I happen to live because we had a significant African American population two hundred miles away\nThat's similar to what could happen here with clean Missouri because they have to have equal representation of Republicans and Democrats so if you live in North St Louis which is what Ninety six percent Democrats in order to level that out the only way you're going to be able to do that is to draw district that goes up to Winfield\nSo all of a sudden you may have your rap in North St Louis and you live in waiting for or vice versa if it Winfield person winds all of a sudden people in North St Louis can be represented by somebody out and Warren County I however they decided to draw the districts so yes some changes need to be made but that's what people need to know now on the flip\nSide of the downsides being makes your representative last rights accessible right ah and less aware of the needs of your particular area if it's two hundred miles away but what\nI find interesting is other states are going towards the model we have in place right now it's not perfect you know and and that's what one of the arguments is is that the races aren't are competitive yeah because if you're the Democrat in North St Louis or one of the districts in in ... you know you're going to win there's no Republican competition on the flip side if your in\nSpringfield her you know the south west Missouri You know you're going to win because it's the same way Ninety percent Republican [noise]\nUm [noise] what is likely to do according to some of the people that I've talked to here\nIs you're going to have these districts that are drawn like crazy lacy clay come out against this as well because it's going to lessen probably ... the ... the the Black Hawk is because you're going to lose some of those districts because they're going to be looked out so it's funny you have Republicans and Democrats for its\nLike Dan fourth and you have Republicans and Democrats against as you got to read the whole thing and figure out of this is something you just want to have you on a show where they do things I find interesting clean Missouri first of all it's been funded by a ton of outside groups\nWhich to me is not playing right now even everybody likes to put her on the George Soros thing he's the one who's put a lot of money into one of his groups it's helping fund is\nNow than it already has the world that I mean it's bad that when you put a name clean Missouri people see clean Missouri they're like oh I like both those words that's called marketing for right yeah and this is the one that almost got thrown off because you're supposed to have a single issue ballot\nSo meaning you're voting on one thing are you going to increase this tax yes are you going to re district yes this lumped in a bunch of things here in one ballot issue and then they added the judge says oh well uh let me find his word here is it's all in the reforming the legislature\nUmbrella that that's the term used that's the problem I have is your voting on a ton of different stuff here that's kind of related but kind of not I think we should vote on each one of these people are for most of this a lot of people are against three district which gives you the way are generally talk about\nThe ... amendment to ... ... ... and perhaps see\nAll of them about marijuana interstate where and all that we couldn't even talk about it yeah it was for medical purposes but the fact that it's finally made it to a ballad long time coming not exactly a head of the curve but why are the three separate thing going on because\nThey all got enough signatures and this is okay so what you're going to do with two of these is you're going to amend the constitution for these very narrow things now that that's not necessarily a bad thing but when you have voters voting on little bitty issues like this it gets kind of messy and that's the issue here\nNow lawmakers I mean I just talked with secretary of state uh Ashcroft and he said he thinks that lawmakers should be the one to do this and I said they had their chance they blown it and he said well it's only you know a few senators it's passed the house\nSo is that why Missourians are widely for this it passed the house in the past few elections what three senators held it up a couple of Republicans or Democrats have cap it off of me in being a law here so people did what they wanted to do and they got it on the ballot so you're voting on a minute to that's the new approach Missouri\nThis I'm going to go see these and if you have any questions I just wanted break these down very quickly okay a minute to four percent tax on medical marijuana sales\nOkay that's one of the lowest one's twenty four million annually this one goes to the department of health helping veterans and other people with life altering medical issues this is the one a lot of doctors researchers and others are in favor of even lawmakers\nHaven't legalized marijuana yet why do we have we're having a conversation about racks isn't as like the heart but we're for\nArt to hope for it they have to find the mechanism of of what it does right so this would legalize medical marijuana right so your doctor prescribes it\nYou can get it and there's a tax on it because the money has to go somewhere right okay so that one benefit veterans and people with life altering conditions only four percent tax that if you're not getting medical marijuana detected matter at All right okay so keep that in my soul amendment to is the one that a lot of lawmakers seem to like amendment three is the one\nFrom Brad Bradshaw I've known bred for Dr Brad ... I've known him for probably Twenty years my wife used to work with his father so I have a\nA a long back story with him so he is a physician and an attorney I heard yes he is ... you've seen the ads for that in this particular bill and here's what has a lot of people concerned Fifteen Percent tax\nBreak amendment to as a ... percent this is a Fifteen Percent tax on medical marijuana sales plus other taxes on things that are grown supporting that so if you grow flowers around your medical marijuana there's a tax on that as well between the farm right so right see it all ties together [noise] sixty six million dollars\nAnd the issue people have is this more or less rights Brad Brad shot into the constitution that sixty six million dollars goes to Bradshaw goes to a board which branch overseas and he selects all the members of that board that's what a lot of lawmakers have trouble that problem with is\nThis goes into the constitution were sixty six million dollars goes to him and he oversees it through his boarding foundation [noise] um I mean he\nCertainly has the access to do whatever he well the money went after eater armored rules right it has to go to cancer or who you are there laws\n... that's what I think a lot of people have trouble with is it puts it under his umbrella and what exactly can say I think that the term in here is cancer research in other right anytime you have other ...\nThat's the problem is other than that leaves the room for for air their room to be manipulated so that amendment three is the is Dr Brad Brad Charles Bell and proxy it's proposition doesn't change the constitution two percent tax\nDepartment of liquor control get this one benefits veterans childhood education and others the reason some people don't like prop see who are in favor of medical marijuana is it's proposition so it can be\nChanged by lawmakers spent ... French marijuana things on the January it's all medical it's not ... not\nYet yeah I mean a lot of states moving that direction but here's here's where I Know a lot of people say I'm just going to vote yes for all of them okay you want to get really in the weeds on this if all tend to write written Louis it all three pass\nConstitutional amendments supersede proposition so prop sees out right so that means that all pass all three pass\nThen the wording in Missouri is so crazy it's the largest percentage of yes votes it's not the total number of yes votes is the largest percentage though you may have more yeah so it's but it's not the bigger percentage so that's how they would decide which one of these two would pass\nSo don't just vote for all three if you're in favor of them know the difference and vote for the one you want otherwise your bill my path and not become the law because the other one got more percentage of votes then you're done and over this entire mess over there is an absolute mess it over\nThe entire thing this is all state wide to end federal law supersedes our eyes so well is still a leader clear otherwise in Missouri no matter what happens when he's thirty\nOne states right now and the federal government could always come in and say you know like they're always worried about in Colorado and California and just come in and say okay no federal lawsuit proceed you guys are all out of business now the odds of that happening probably not I Ga\nAll armored wind these things up and come back and get to a few more of these things including the zoo and interesting that the county the only ones\nBeing targeted for that vote will get to that in a second uh Fox jewelers John Brown kind enough to shed some light on all of this\nWhich otherwise honestly we'd be way to earth and probably not in the dark talking about at all I Gen Jamie underway sugar fire smoke ... open right now in treating you and feeding frenzy want to have an election viewing party\nWhy not swayed by and grab bishops kept portrays a brisket bringing mom we're having a night ...\nYear election party that's kind of stupid no one having to buy her tonight oh All right there are you going\nAre you going to now we are we're they carry out his going after my alliance the average you know what I'm trying to us no shame I have no I don't have a Jack Buck memorabilia collection to sell well neither do I yeah would you get enough to bring in tomorrow for a rubber tonight\nAnd he was talking about the ballot issue and it's ... and we're going to be voting on it and uh I think that a lot of people are maybe confused on this because it's the county people that are being taxed when they actually go to the zoo but does he needs the money to keep doing what they do with our phrase it\nThis is this is I think the problem people have here and it's interesting too because even the former mayor of Clinton the former museum district had been you could tell is against it\nYou would think the guy who but it's like eight cents well it's here here's what I think his issue isn't that the issue a lot of people have so again sales tax increase solely on St Louis county nobody else at this point\nYou're talking eighty percent of all funding for the zoo comes from St Louis county alone and that they use a lot not as much fifty five percent of the people who would tend to do that\nThat they use and a lot not as much fifty five percent of the people who would tend to do come from outside the taxing district which a single city in St Louis county Jeffrey Bonner Dr Geoffrey Geoffrey bottom where you had on the show\nSo I think I think the problem there's some people have here is is that people in St Louis county you're paying the bulk of the money for the zoo simplicity pay some to what their what their taxes\nBut was fifty five percent of the people who go to the zoo coming from outside they're coming from St Charles ... all over the world right couldn't you put in some sort of small entrance fee just a couple of bucks that would help covered that so you spreads out a little bit more so right now if you look at a singles county is providing as world class zoo for everybody else to enjoy now that may be\nThe right way to do it I'm not is not of the stick as large scale and then and that you have what we pride ourselves on every the San Diego zoo it's like fifty four dollars a person four dollars for adults forty four dollars for kids to get in right imagine that since the start that it's ... I don't know\nI yeah and so you're talking three and a half million visitors a year more than half of one point nine million for maybe outside the district even a small entrance fee I mean they do it at some of the other you know the botanical gardens if you're in the county if you you you pay right or you don't pay\n'em so again this is this is a tax and I think the issue is is going to drive the sales tax up to over ten percent and a lot of districts are a lot of places in St Louis county it's not much\nI'm a lot of people say I don't care I Love my new I'm going to pay for it I I so you got to read the ballot language on this one\nUm and it does it's not just people who live in St Louis county if you shop in St Louis county you're going to attack so yeah you will get some tax dollars there\nWhat about smoking smoking is always a ballot measure was smoking in the snow and usually say Charles and smoking they know it's funny because you know there are two smoking issues just like this like medical marijuana there to\nUh one charter minute property one charter amendment prop as stable deal with smoking\nOr in casinos so I mean to me I have smoke smell skills you stop to it you have that much attention because I don't smoke and I don't go to casinos so that when they may have just kind of glossed over his check the box on those two All right but I Do know what they mean and uh so yeah so I'm In St Louis county stuff\nYou got the gas tax which is ...
