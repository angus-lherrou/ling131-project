and the whole deal as they break in location here to eighty five hundred Marilyn avenue and kind enough\nTo invite us along for the ride David and Danny carpet our house we had a chance to meet Brian Jordan a little bit earlier a satisfied customer and and former cardinal that someone else who's in the mix his pastor Cedric parties from the third Presbyterian Church which you'll find Lewis and Clark and I would say\nYou were the best dressed minister I've ever seen in my entire life\nWell thank you for that may be one of the ... human beings we've ever seen in our lives let's give it up for that price\nNow they don't get a lot of fat out let's give it up to this are more sensitive belt they were really man you're dating yourself with the sense of ... you know you're going to start your own\nCalled us this morning and we had a thought a conference call about his eye to eye on them go and I only have half as our way of half a decade on you I'm not that I have a five year don't let the pants throw you I mean I like the trash\nOut our it's got friars club or oh here near\nVery well dressed yes he's are burned as far as ... so you are a pastor at hope Presbyterian Church for like ... how did you how did you get down that path\nTo pass the Haitian on it yeah well for me is not a vocation we're calling right I'm In Nineteen Ninety nine I was called to be a preaching minister and in two thousand three um\nTook over the church I cheer of calling and if this is too personal just tell me and go back to age jokes on but you know you hear about people with awakenings with calling ...\n... was there like a moment in time was it a voice was it something you saw happened that symbolizes that you should be doing something else or what what may determine what made you go the way he went\nThrough study through study of the Bible that laid the foundation and things that were happening in in life I didn't want to do this did you grow up in a religious home no no not really so where do I come from to begin with the study but I was I Would you even pick up a Bible\nMy wife yeah that way when ... when I say I want you to go to a Bible study with me right okay so I had a\nCouple of engineering degree so I knew how to study so I started studying and right and it just kind of went from there but I this is something that I did not want to do so that's why since that has a calling right because I was running from it I did not want to hear at all but uh\nAnd that's usually what it is calling us something that's the opposite of anything you were off when\nYou're working with kids now are what are you doing in the community to help lift people up\nOr right now I Am I'm president ... school board for the last two years and so my involvement in in that in trying to transform a enormous school district we are provisional accreditation back\nUm we just this morning broke ground on a multi million dollar early childhood center ... awesome so we're investing heavily into early childhood education because you're bringing the scissors because we're going to last year I think they have their own view out actually had shovels ground this ribbon cutting\nSo that that is right and also I Would think it also represents a growth in the community\nVery much growth and transformation because this was a twenty three million dollar bond that is the community pass so we're all in on education because that's going to be transformative to that particular community also also do some a mentoring work\nAnd he's with school district and the river valley school district so I'm heavily involved with the kids\nThat's great we love to hear that and then how did you and David meat and how did the two you get together for but\nSpoke apparel so David and I'm met in seminary school or at eating Theological Seminary and we met in in uh in in Greek class when this all grouped in Maine\nRight next to me as a guy that was always asked to stay after an eraser and all of that in the corner penalty time it surprises you may be\nVery intelligent very book smart that I'm not a big issue right he's trying to come up off the fleet [laughter] but I I'm\nYou know I'm David we we just we just hit it off we just started talking about things and I'm asked him what he did and he talks about the students and I was a pastor at the time so I said well what do you think about the um you know making me a couple of suits and um I think my first order was I think\nUm you know making me a couple of suits and um I think my first order was I think\nOr four suits and I'm just to let you know\nBack in two thousand ten they were they they were ... they had cos you still have my doubts other item out alive or they're they're done at that point there is the master was like two Ninety or two Seventy at the time really yeah when I when I met David I was about to sixty five\nI'm In the year two thousand I was three hundred pounds how'd you lose the weight or did you have a growth spurt\nSpiritual growth spurt rifle lost all the weight of focusing on a life what did I Want to do so that uh the motivation to have to come from you know not from me so that part of my my worship in is a part of my old to my family\nA need to live as long the life as I can so therefore for them this is what I Do so if the motivation is not me than I Will always be motivated to continue on especially on days that I don't feel like it\nSo over the course of the last Seventeen years I've lost about a hundred and ten pounds so right now I'm about five pounds over where I graduated high school it while\nI I actually way less than what my driver's license says which that's pretty rare\nI just never changed it I mean I just bought what they said after the lion when I was sixteen and I think I'm Still line today to ... know that a drought and\nNow there's fire but I always write it actually says if you're joining us pastor Cedric port is with us from the third Presbyterian Church\nWhich you will find on a Lewis and Clark and another satisfied customer of David ... spoke apparel\nWhere we are and David also allowed to and not to make this like joy is Sam but while we're on the road is safe and we're talking about such thing as long as we're better drivers first of all of them to join us there's a second they get out of the ...\nIs able to uh take stocks on prayer and his feelings are about faith to work because he's a minister year Colyer so it's a big difference so your philanthropy and your theology spills out in a different way here\nI Would think would be this this suiting up soldiers let's talk about that\nYes I\nHave always been focused on the ministry of my clothing business if not a\nCareer that really is a calling I've the athletes I've been around the F we get the Sunni business out of the way quickly and then we spend an hour and a half in prayer talking about a very serious situation in their life\nI could name probably ten right now that are still with us because of our prayer time together I mean literally with us\nAnd it really showed me I mean all along the way that this isn't about the clothing it's about the human relationships it's about building bonds between peoples that normally wouldn't necessarily interact\nAnd I'm not necessarily a soldier I was born in a little bit late for the Vietnam War and they wouldn't have taken me anyway not that late but dad was in the Korean War and it really struck home when I kept hearing stories of men and women coming home making that transition from a\nMilitary uniform which was given to them and provided by you know they cleaned it they did everything for it\nTo now have to be swimming in a pond they had no clue how to do\nHow do you do the stroke of business and they need the help so the idea is to hear the stories of these heroes yet this out get this in the community so that people know about them and their struggles and of course we'll pick four to\nTo close her head to toe so that they can then go to the job interview\nYou looked at by someone the other the other senses are constantly in in action\nBased on what you see and make an effort into making that first and second third and fourth and before you open your mouth you're making so many impressions and once you do\nThen you've got to be followed up with consistency you're nominating people or the public or the public I Want the public to nominate their heroes tell me about their stories we will choose what the panel of of pasture and some others that will choose for that we really think deserve\nAnd the rest were given Syria's discount too and we're we're actually starting a foundation that can\nThat can underwrite they can underwrite for hero oh that's great what is the timeframe on October thirty first is are cut off so we can sit down and and analyze all the applications and the where did they go to do this exactly yes or send us an email that suit up\nYou know so you you pick right up there last night we went back to the Americans after about three months off and not only could I not careful you what episode we left it took me about forty five minutes to figure out which season\nOh wow you left off and we found\nOur spot and I got about a sea is not a half left oh good okay\nVery very tiring almost his diaries listening to that explanation\nDid you watch ... and the uh the the ... the Roseanne\n... the the ... the Roseanne redo\nI did in fact I have a little story about that so NBC did not release screeners of it the way they normally network or they just\nPut it in their ... and you can watch it on your computer or whatever um you had to go to a special screening and either LA or New York to watch the first two episodes in order to write a review which is what I did I went went up to New York to watch it um but I've seen the first two I including the one that aired this week\nAnd you're you know um I liked it I thought it was funny and in a lot of weight as weird as it sounds without Roseanne Barr and that\nIt felt more uh in line with the original kind of tone and sensibility of um the\nThe original series and the really good um earlier this year so you know I don't know what kind of longevity and has a fairly but again I think I said before when we were talking about this a few months ago\nYou know you've got John couldn't you've got loyal Metcalf you got here it Gilbert and he's got a a really strong group of actors and characters that we've also come to care about and that and they can carry a show pretty well all by themselves\nBut do you think that they bite us not screened it um because they weren't sure they weren't going to fire anybody else before cable TV\nNo I don't ... the the concern which I honestly thought was kind of silly would they did not want people to talk about how they are going to get off the show and in fact we had to agree in writing that when they're not going to reveal the circumstances of that explained why look in hunter wasn't on the show any more even know\nIf you watched last year and I think even Roseanne Barr has said something because I figured out why she would be gone\nBut they did not want us to talk about and dancing with gang weirdly secretive about that\nShould we stay how it happened I don't want to do I want to know Goodman told us that though I Do want she tripped and fell into a raise the stranded\nYeah or how did they killed Charlie Sheen he got hit by a Bush yeah it was something\nReally it didn't not nice for me I got a got hit by a train or something\nYou're going to do a mall or gigantic it sank yell or got shot and they had All right then they couldn't see me will really of them to\nDo your benefit of the doubt if they haven't seen it by next week and we'll just weeks but Jen I'm Amazed I mean you worked for a an online and print publication it's it's a fantastic ... dot com it as well as New York magazine\nThey sent you all the way to New York city from Washington DC just to watch a TV show New York\nI thought that far [laughter] oh yeah big deal I mean the half hour ago I also got\nTo spend some time in the office I mean ideally I go to the office you know\nA regular basis just to see people in person and sell it served that are you\nGetting able to watch the show and write the review\nOr rebooting are alias and it was one of my I don't recommend it to anyone because I don't think the\nArtistic value is there at the end of the day but it was my guilty indulgence and not just seeing her in polyester but I talked to were slung corky little episodes and it was a good show I'm Glad it's coming back do we know who's playing her role or she can do it again\n[noise] I actually don't know and and I I Would I Would be concerned to have somebody else in that role that isn't Jennifer Garner um I think a lot of the appeal of that show was not only her but\nA lot of the other people in the cash including from nobody you've probably never heard of named Bradley Cooper\nRight oh yeah yeah the ... Bradley Cooper\n[laughter]\n... back up their Lady Gaga I Know that\nWhat it is and probably part of it being that she's tied up with a show on HBO Now\nYes he's in the show a camping um which is from ah Lena Dunham in guinea Connery dead at girls' high and you know she is terrific and\nI Wish I liked the show a little bit more than I Do uh it's about a a bunch of people middle age people on a camping trip people are constantly fighting with each other ah so your tolerance of how much of that you can watch a little a very um but there are parts of it that are definitely funny\nOkay and what about making of a murderer season too [noise]\nSo here's here's another fun I'm saying they they're in a bar go on that which we discovered today we accidentally published I review before he goes to a bar code it until tomorrow which is when it comes out\nAt night again I Believe that's related to secrecy they don't want people to to say too much about what is and the fees that and even though and I think that there's an issue for the second season like the making of murder sure there were probably people who followed the Steven every case\nBut if you didn't it just took a wild story of this guy who gets exonerated for for committing one crime gets out of jail and then just a couple of years later is back in jail accused of murder that he said he didn't commit um\nWe've all this story has become so high profile that you know I think a lot of people are much more aware of it and also tracking what's been happening in that and that's really what the season is about the tense you appeal I'm Steven every case or not the ... case and sort of how that has continued first came out\nI don't know how they're going to stretch this into another season the television I thought that eight or ten episode arc which probably two episodes too long as it was well I think that mother really carry the whole show you shoot shot [laughter] you know she's not doing news coverage or whatever I which I don't I don't\nThink I'll get in trouble with Netflix for saying that there are a lot of phone conversations go yeah yeah\nOh yeah are you sure their daughter was a bar good when they told you you had to go to New York for the screening come on Jen on which the pieces together and we got a scoop put thank you for the time will read your culture got kind of course five thanks for keeping us up to speed\nThank you I'd be well by Jenny Sanford\nWho I bet she wishes she was here is broken down because there's nice women's ... you know is a suit after the man's predicament or watch making a murder you've never heard anyone to put it off it seemed too long\nNow you've got to give it a minute if he if if you go you have to make that commitment and promised me you'll go to and a half episodes for sure\nWhether wife when maybe two episodes and she was like this isn't going anywhere so when she said that about you [noise] do you think you really just five\nOr six annual fine wine
