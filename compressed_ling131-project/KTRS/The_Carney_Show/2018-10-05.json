good are acts okay and you can go on your computer you can go on your phone download the app you don't have to download the app you can just go on line this is not a paid endorsement though and it's not not yet known I Am really\nBut here's what it does it took a prescription of my mom's from three hundred dollars down to like thirty four Ninety nine and I'm not kidding and so what you do is you print out the coupon it'll give you an option whether you want to go to Walgreens\nCBS Cosco Sam enlisted therefore you just print it out\nAnd I am of course I'm not an expert in this area but it worked a lot is last night you go to ... him to coupon you say don't run it to my insurance just use this coupon and they get the drill they're like okay I mean and it took the price down dramatically otherwise they would mention it's called the good are\nActs would obviously you have to have a prescription for whatever it is that you're writing Zach\nRarely yes you do have to have a prescription yeah I mean it's I mean I you know it worked for us and somebody a friend of mine told me about it and I wanted to tell everyone because it's a big money saved\nThe other question I have about this uh and I don't know if you guys haven't answered 'em because\nYou're circumventing your insurance company even though you're only paying like thirty bucks or whatever does that circumvent your deductible so I I Wish you wouldn't go torture deductible and\nI guess I wouldn't know I guess I mean I don't know I'm certainly this is a very complicated it's over my head all I Know as I saved a whole lot of money\nHere's my question by switching the ... you know\nA Fifteen minutes I went to Sam's Club to get a prescription calling us two hundred and thirty bucks at ... costs me twelve dollars at Sam's Club did you use this coupon so no I signed up for you know the same school car\nOr whatever pays for itself isn't that crazy here's the thing either someone is subsidizing this\nAnd paying for it on the back and then I met scene or\nThese prescriptions are way overpriced to begin with so I think they are\nOr these prescriptions are way overpriced to begin with I think they are but I think some of the bigger companies can negotiate with the drug companies to get the prices down any I mean that's my I don't know\nI think the drug companies are just say well five hundred bucks\nTo show a while you were sleeping\nA Senate committee coming together to a vote in favor of Brett Kavanaugh now moving to the full Senate which is expected to happen in the morning a not a lot of surprises there was a little reluctant see and we did get I mean against is there's\nA big story\nThat you had a\nLady lands Virginia Murkowski\nWho voted against the nomination and being a Republican that's that's turned some heads you still got ... saying well I voted to move forward if they do the FBI things\nBut I'm Still going to wait and see may change my vote tomorrow I don't know should these things to lots of near although I don't think anybody's going to be truly surprise\nInside this goes through as planned I he joined us early in the week as we talked about this the senior editor of the Washington Post's Marc Fisher told yeah we call you back thanks for taking the call\nSure no problem\nAny surprises since we last visited\n[laughter] well I guess so I mean certainly uh we've had a lot of machinations in the Senate and certainly there's been a larger interest in this across the country from both sides than anyone had anticipated I don't think a month ago anyone would have said that the Supreme Court nomination\nWould be the primary factor perhaps in determining who wins the mid term elections coming up in a few weeks\nSo that's in the back of the minds of every senator who's voting\nToday and tomorrow and that's really the subtext of this whole nomination struggle\nDo you do because this was such a strange process I including the the FBI investigation and went for days and whenever a is is going to change the way this process works going forward is they're already discussions about hey this obviously has broken we need to\nLive and heard anything like that in fact when I heard more frequently is the idea that this is just a a one off this is something strange because of the nature of this particular nominee if you look back just\nOr some months ago when we had Neil Gorsuch going through the process they went to extremely smoothly there was no controversy about him there were people who liked his philosophy of those who didn't they voted accordingly but there was no rhythm all there was no drama and the system seemed to work\nSo ... what's happening here is a reflection of the political polarization we're seeing across the country for more than it is a question of the process and the Senate\nSuper oh sorry go ahead no I'm just wondering by the time we put our heads on our pillows tomorrow we're going to know here's this this is God's here or not so when that John and the most in common and I assume they share with us immediately or maybe not maybe there's more about this I don't know uh\nAt what point does he become a Supreme Court judge\nHe
