kept believing 'cause they would get fired [laughter] you\nKnow I don't know I don't want to get a job you know 'cause some of that stuff maybe but she says hey I I saw a story you know is it Halloween related\nIt was oh hey I I\nSaw a story you know is it Halloween related it is okay because it has the story of a uh I I Know this was a crazy kind of beginning to a story a and a Republican

zone for that but there was always a lot of activity there and I only knew it was a church because on Halloween\nThey'd have you know all kinds of lights and flashing things in music playing things to draw the crowd and it was right on the corner so a lot of kids would come by but they come up when you come up to the table and see that there was information about\nLord and savior and this and like oh okay All right so you bring us in with the lights and the fog machine I used to shop and lord and savior but it got a little expensive oh it's starting to expand I said they had all this stuff and they gave people a little pocket Bible story which as\nYou would go from their house to find that out as you would go down the street to some of the other houses you could always find your way back
