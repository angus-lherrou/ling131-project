I'm supposed to be in there a little while to get my tonsils out I'm I'm not going to be able to make it thanks bye [laughter] gets haired and I wish I would've done it\nBecause you just you get sick a lot less you know I yeah you do you have a lot less trouble with that kinda stuff did\nWe ever find out a\nLoaded super painful I was talking to Dr Aaron Boone about it is I've thought about doing it again yeah and she was saying that it is I mean you better really need it as an adult because you will be hurting so do we all have our tonsils here than I\nDo know for one to six let's take a a mini poll you still have your tonsils I have my wisdom to\n... oh you do hear my dad or is incredibly pet it'll tonsils out with just easier for a third\nOf don't ask how old is your job well my gosh if he was still alive and Europe\nDuring the depression and they didn't have any money he needed his tonsils out they had him use that ... what is it they're going to eat or eat there on a\n... from what I Know of it it's just kind of um you know makes you incredibly loopy laughing gas railroads similar similar see\nThat's all they gave him and took his dials out I mean he was kind of a bad ass can I say that on the roads ... we live by the\nWay is is very uh it it's tough the recovery takes a while 'cause I had my wisdom teeth taken out it takes a\nWhile to recover how old were you when you had um oh twenties or so I'll see and so I did mine when I was Eighteen and I had the ... of course I get like all the extra the dry ... went on and on my dad had 'em out this summer it was ... it was a total breeze no pain medication needed just the Advil and\nThe super duper Advil that they gave you an ice packs and packs of peas it was no problem you need to have your wisdom teeth out\nNo I feel fine uh and I think I have I think I have three\nSo one on each shy except for one and that's a ... so I don't I Wonder what that means about you and the dentist said you're you know you're good to go as long as you feeling pain no gain some people keep them I don't know but my wife had them out turn into a chipmunk a yeah her whole like\nStuffed with cotton and there's a story I can share with you I'm but I'm not going to share it on the air because it's just you know that\nWay but she ran out of cotton she ran out of gauze and they had to use something else in the house that has gotten in it and I'll just leave it at that point taken right uh so that was pretty funny my brother had it has taken out and I took care of him when he did because he was\nGone really drugs that they give you must be super duper I don't know that's how I was I was on a\nDifferent planet I remember my dad took me to to mine I remember just being like really weird like almost an out of body experience member David\nAt the dentist Youtube video\nWhere they're now he's like six years old he admired laughing yeah real life is this are alive oh my gosh um\nWould you poster kids video or something like that I Would not I wouldn't I think it's a\nI wouldn't buy also wouldn't say that a coworker had strep throat either because I I like to respect other ... now you said it [laughter] uh I really would not hosts my children did I really hope she's OK with us [laughter]\nUh I really I Would not host my children did I really hope she's OK with us [laughter]\nUm but ah in this is my point here uh Laura's out so ... and so we have to fill in for Carney there's a new study out do you hate one of your co workers because you always have to cover for them\nWhen they're out either on their days off or when they're sick or that the uh what is a steady say fifty percent of people say it makes their day way more stressful to have to cover for someone else I don't like it you know\nYou do you like it because you take over the shell but my feet up there you go I Carney\nA forty one percent say that they have to do extra work to cover for their co workers who are out without extra now is raising his hand yeah you do huh uh-huh and there's no extra pay that comes with that which I always wonder you know how is that why is that a thing\nBecause you're supposed to be here for a certain number of hours anyway I guess yeah and I'm\nSure that you know when I'm Out somebody else covers for me\nI feel like we all kind of fell in for each other and we you know teamwork makes the dream work\nFor this this is funny forty percent say that that worked there covering doesn't always get done well certain kind of when you're you're a filling in for someone else\nOh well I'm Sorry about that I ... no ... to see that I joke that I was doing it and he's not doing well you just have to ask a long way to go for that jokes\nBut I Will tell you that what I don't like is when your co workers rip on meal\nFor not being here and that happens a lot in the afternoon child on at this radio station you know I mean if somebody's sick they're sick and so you know to go on for ten minutes about how we can't believe that they didn't have the nerve to show up because they the the\nThe money you're talking about you [noise] uh [laughter] thirty seven percent have grown to resent a co worker because of all the time they worry over for them or it is a strong word and you know I like I said I ... he's not here it's you know it's my time to shine\nSo there you know take your time John ... men suited to do he\nWill be on today so I'm sure he's listening it's not like he's\nUm he's going to hang out with Matt and Sherry today the survey did find that fifty percent of people feel guilty about taking time off and having to have someone cover for them\nSo I Do even when I had that allergic reaction which was insane a couple of weeks ago there I shared my hip on on on the radio I felt horrible about not but I really literally could not come in I mean I couldn't drive yeah and I was going out of town later that we felt double guilty it's like I Can't enjoy\nThat we should share that picture of you know we shouldn't you looked you looked like hitch from the movie which I mean it was when I leave adding an allergic reaction\nIt was really in my husband's like why did the show that to everybody I mean I guess I Want everybody to believe me that I was really sick and I really at an allergic reaction and how severe weather that I wasn't just like I'm not going to go and I just I don't know it's something inside me that I just feel the need to share fabulously over ... I feel\nGuilty to a and I try because Macs covers for me and Willie and Robert de everyone here covers when we're all out and I tried to get things set up as much as I can\nUh so it normally takes me about two days into the vacation where I finally I'm like okay we're good then it's time to do now you know\nI filled in for other people and it's fine I don't know why I think is such a burden but a fifty six percent of people do feel guilty when they're out and making someone else cover for them but\nThirty seven percent\nOf workers are resentful when they have\nTo watch out for that crew thirty seven percent there probably only messing with your lunch when you're not in the kitchen or something\nNow who is your feeling at work and just kind of go by their desk in and see you know hey\nI Am a Starbucks yeah something nice I liked\nThat aid for one to six if you want to text in way and have you ever had a problem at work or with one of your co workers\nMm I don't they keep from getting debris or gross things\nTonsils and I don't I don't like you said the tonsils give you more sore throats seems like\nIt's interesting to me that you didn't have your wisdom teeth out because now I'm thinking maybe it's a racket maybe I don't need to have all my kids with some teeth out yeah maybe it is because it's not cheap no it's not I mean I think it was a couple of thousand dollars I mean insurance paid for some but not home\nDo you think that your dentist as well and we we took the wisdom teeth out but those aren't due to you if they're looking for all those\nDo now he referred me to somebody else you have to go to an oral surgeon for the wisdom teeth\nOh yeah that is true a lot of blood on those surgeries too from what I remember I'm OK coming up next we're going to go a commercial break coming up next we're going to check in with Kate Andersen Brower she's the author of a book on first women are the book is called first women um\n[noise] the grace and power of America's modern first ladies\nAligning at Trump went on her first solo trip to Africa and we'll find out how that went and uh what she did over there and find out how millennia Trump is doing in the eyes of an expert is doing as our first lady it's the Carney show minus John Carney Josh and Julie feeling and today we'll be back right after this\nIs John county we certainly want you to catch the county show all week long between you and then three but on the weekends there's a program that Trump's me in offering valuable advice it is straight talk on retirement and each and every week\nJeff in there and look Peters go at it and they take your phone calls and they help you with your money that money that you've got socked away for a rainy day it's gonna rain you're gonna retire at some point you want to make sure that that money is safe or better yet that that cash is making more money\nSome of what her husband does on Twitter and I think that she's found that to be difficult you know because people are saying well she's a hypocrite look at her husband that you know with a great it's a great idea and she does connect to our children\nAnd so in that way I think that she is a positive influence and look her approval ratings are I think the highest among anyone in this administration\nOr to you brought it up so let's go there be best that's the the online bullying campaign every first lady seems to kind of\nTake on a cause Nancy Reagan was was just saying do Michelle Obama and most recently with a healthy eating she's attacking the Internet bullying and as you show and I think everyone can objectively agreed that President Donald Trump\nInternet bullied do remember when he gave Lindsey Graham so four number up on Twitter\nBut she is trying to I'm too keen on that and she's also doing some other things that people would say her first showing your trip abroad is to one of the whole country the president talked about\nPeople are saying that she's trailing the president and waiting and thinking that this is kind of defiance and resistance but what is the White House said about that\nYou know they they do not say that she trolling her husband and I mean they is it is you know she was found that said that she agrees with the big game hunting that Donald Trump junior and Eric Trump are Fonda you know we could cheat and in Kenya she visited\nSaid you know endangered sea the is there and she was sitting they've yellow than it was very sweet bite alive\nAnd she said is against kids against that kind of punting which hurts steps I enjoy and so again I think you know yeah in some way as she is trolling him by just disagreeing with him outwardly such as administration has made it easier to do that kind of hunting and you know on the trip she was\nTalking a lot about us aid and the money that is\nIn Africa and she was visiting orphanages that directly benefited from American money and that is the money that the Trump Administration has tried to cut\nSo ... so I just think that yeah I mean ... the bladder than words she would never say it herself and yelling and the white out the state I think you can see all these examples going to the border was an incredible moment although that that that she wore had\nNo idea why she where that jacket how did the court said that I really don't care jackets\nBut I think that she does these things and that show that she is at odds with her husband in some ways and\nDo you think when you when you think of family and extended families and step sons and all of that my goodness if you put my whole family in in a room you know on Thanksgiving or whatever the holiday maybe I mean everybody has different perspectives\nUm and I think that that's OK different opinions are okay and I like the fact\nThat she feels\nLike she's liberated I guess enough to go out and do her own thing and that she doesn't have to just be locked up in the White House she can say what you feel\nWhy I think that that's right I think people want to see the first lady I think people want to see more of her though than we see and she is so high that she hasn't done an interview and I think that the in the White House she has done some off the record lunches with people\nBut those those are just you know\nKind of college or to do so\nThey're not things that anyone's for reporting purposes so I think she seems trapped in the White House and I think we saw her happier than we've ever seen her when she was in Africa where you saw dancing were dissolved fly like they don't really see that in Washington we see a lot of stilted\nKind of almost anything in that photo opportunity was really amazing so in some ways she's more transparent than a lot of first ladies who don't necessarily like the kind of put on a brave face throughout the whole thing\nWe didn't see public discourse with the Obamas we didn't see public discord with the Bush is either Bush family really I mean they seem to really be\nI don't know salad families we did see a lot with the Clinton and and you felt that you know you could feel the icing out in the little looks and the you know going to grab their hand and the other one turning away or ... you know whatever the case may be\nUm is there anybody else in history that you can think of that compares to the situation that we're living now\nAnybody else who has been as unhappy and and the role you mean yeah\nI mean I ... I tell\nYou I mean she loved it until the until Lewinsky and everything right now I mean the only way that you have someone like that Truman who\nLeft Washington every opportunity right to go back the independence of their age she hated being first lady and said why does anyone care about me and just the president's wife and the mother of his daughter\nBut every other first lady including Michelle Obama\nDefinitely Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush Laura Bush they enjoyed aspects of the job I mean a shallow bomber was definitely ready to leave but she grew into the role and enjoyed it and I think we saw her enjoy it more\nThan millennia Trump She certainly couldn't wait I mean by that last year she was standing down the days to have some kind of someone for the normal life again speaking\nThis ever happened in history at least in the modern era or have there has there ever been a first lady that was not born in America\nNot in the modern era I Know I'm Louisa Adams was born in London so really the only way that John Quincy Adams his wife [noise]\nYou go way back there to the nineteenth century right so we haven't had any first lady who has and also by the way born in England is different you spoke English obviously she was not this was not a foreign language to her and I think family is from the five languages\nI think that it's a bit of a struggle for her because she speaks of any ...\nUm I think that it's a bit of a struggle for her because she's the Slovenian her parents\nLive in the DC area although they're very tight lipped on where exactly they spend all their time in my heart and soul mat and then also in the White House\nOccasionally and their and their sons they pose any end and English and I think we forget that you know it's it's a culture shock I think it's probably difficult is the first lady is a hard roll for anyone to understand fully even if you're born here so I think that's an added\nStruggle for her to really understand the position and I say she also has a very small staff less than half of what Michelle Obama had and I think that's really not a good thing I think she could use more as like\nDo you think that um she gets more criticism and more or more freeze because of her out because of what she's wearing\nA because she's a former former model is that why people look at her I mean you look back and Michelle Obama and people will say wow I Love to address it was forty dollars from Jay Crew you know and and then people criticize millennia Trump or how much money she spends on her close is that\nThe government's money or is that their personal money\nThere he wore Joe we are what they're wearing it we sometimes designers\nWill give it to them\nSometimes they buy it themselves but the ... you know it's not tax dollars spent on their clothes but a lot of first ladies\nYou know like we're going heart or did not want to spend a lot of money on clothes because they thought I looked sadly as first lady sexually during a recession was ... really elegantly millennia Trump is only live first lady I think it would set for Nancy Reagan\nWho we seem to ... just not terror at all about making clothes accessible I mean she's not\nMixing the high in the low and the way that Michelle Obama did say clue she would weigh like it's a group card again but very expensive you know shoes or something and the millennia wearing like fifty thousand dollar jackets\nRight I mean that was something that was really surprising to me is that didn't get more criticism than any other white house it would have um\nYou know she's also a former model loved fashion she can afford it you know so why not there's an argument to be made she enjoys that should do it\nAnd Jackie Kennedy was a great fashion icon looking back I don't know if the time at the time they looked at her like that but looking back I Love to look at books are special edition magazines that feature what she was wearing it's just interesting\nYeah I think that I think ... are really trying to model herself and then look at the inauguration she loves it was straight out of Jackie Kennedy a play block it was you know the gloves and that's how to lose seats and so I think there's a lot of reference fair for um\nFor Jackie Kennedy style and also how you know Jackie Kennedy doesn't get a lot of credit for this but she did open up the White House for the first time I'm In a televised is for for millions\nOf Americans to see where you live\nThat you had a TV could have been inside of the White House and that was a big deal and head of the ... thing and I do think that ... percent time learning about the furniture and the White House I Know she's all the people and the curators office\nBBC Radio news all actually gets hurt exclusively on
