here a lesser sit now that the PCC was started by Presidents Reagan and Bush to provide an authoritative way to know about and measured global warming\nWas started a just as Reagan was going out of office sentence Bush was coming in and it has a ... involves thousands of the best scientists in the world to can reason about global warming\nAnd of course uh the idea of scientists having a plot I never saw two scientists who could agree on anything much less have a plot so when you see the IPC see reports they're\nRepresenting a hundred and Seventy nations with thousands of individual scientists on a couple of dozen a rep parade report about individual segments and they've been active\nFor all that time since the eighties on now and each time they provided more exact report they
