our cars right and so we had a in in Nashville they have one called national nightmare\nAnd there were a bunch of friends who decided to go and as they were standing outside approaching somebody that they thought and it turns out it wasn't but somebody they thought was one of the ghouls from inside the national nightmare\nThey for nosy and mine is will be on the radio I mean they were going to be like if you like people shouldn't be in a toll booth or work in retail where you're actually with\nThe people you know with people right here with us were to happen or not we with people I feel like we're with a friend now he sold on ... on through six cells or are people I feel like there are a tribe and Ireland I like\nI just wondered just because I thought with a grain disconnect between doctors and their children and in the conversation my doctor one of his kid is a doctor he immediately started beaming with pride I didn't think he should get into this 'cause I'm Still paying\nCollege but my son's a doctor and all of a sudden the tone changes yeah early proud they don't encourage your kids to do what they do but would you and I both doing what our parents did and it got me thinking about that of\nWhy do why do we follow when parental footsteps it didn't matter if you're a broadcast or you're a doctor or your plumber or whatever it is if you do what one of your parents did or your aunt or your uncle and followed in the family footsteps in some way\nI'm curious as to why you did that why why did you start down this path I Do think\nIs the ash Josh knows I a or a dozen times so corny dad jak said uh you don't want to do this kid he said don't do this this is why I got into that you actually do the rebellion totally\nI Love it I got thirty four years this plight under my belt and do you do it was he didn't he didn't want me to do you want your boys to do this\nUm [noise] I don't know if it made them happy or\nI certainly enjoyed it it treated my father extremely well fiscally\nDifferent now I mean it's really different yeah one of the money's not there but I my dad had a conversation with me saying that's not what it used to be\nAnd the money's not an radio and you know I'm not getting rich but my lights are on at home and I've raised for cage and it paid alimony for way too long you know so I'm I'm Still in the game many news\nSo uh yeah I don't know ... are also tech signed open and they fall into six so if you did follow parental footsteps your family's footsteps curious as to\nWhy has it brought you satisfaction argue the second of three generations or a third of four generations of family members that did what you do you know didn't Brooke job and then\nStart selling furniture because dad was in Dallas\nOn a buying trip what am I the Genovese he diamonds diamonds yo following a Michael's footsteps ... some of the jobs out there were bad happens to the most Joe had bigger feet than my mind was a little tiny guy you know I
