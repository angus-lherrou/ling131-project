along with Kevin ... good\nAfternoon it's cold it's like we just jump straight over fold and we we have two seasons we of hot and cold and us down a notch or whatever the spring and fall and frozen you have a a U.S attack seminar earlier in the week you are packed to the gills no more tax seminars for the rest of the year\nAs of now we're done for taking taking the holidays off probably kick one sometime in January but we won't announce it till sometime in December but the last workshop we just had\nIt was packed good you know again to all we're doing is trying to help people figure out how you can get money out of your accounts that you've never pay tax on tax rate right\nTrying to show how to maximize Social Security you know with the market drawn to him and everything that's been going on sometimes when you have a plan to just makes you feel a heck of a lot more comfortable\nAbsolutely yeah All right so here's what to do since you can't get into any more attacks seminars this year you can go to the website when retirement happens dot com or the website is great it's a great place to go for great resources and you can register get on a waiting list and a village you know the next attack seminar no also on that Web sites\nWhere you have all sorts why papers will will get to the checklist hearing the second but you said something to me before he went on air which I thought was kind of interesting\nUh and picking up on something we've talked about last week of your clients you know you might get one or to Mars has been somewhat of all over the last couple of weeks and one of your clients my call up\nAnd say hey what are we doing this and that but you said something interesting all your clients are okay there you train them you've educated them they know what's going on but it's the people who aren't working with you friends family people stop you know ... they're the ones all freaking out over this deal\nYou know I think a lot of people are freaking out over what happened in the ... when you see a two day drop over Thirteen hundred point you start to wonder you\nWere my town looks like I haven't been looking into statements coming in or I haven't even now I'm Down to this much money I thought I was going to retire in a year or three years from now and\nI have a lot less money than I had before but the thing is I mean is it I mean you think about fear right fear really starts when we don't know what's going on when the unknown is there and wait and windows to meet together\nIt really starts panic right I'm just going to sell right or I'm going to war five more years\nI I'm just going to sell right or I'm going to war five more years or or what have you but here's the thing do we really know where we're at\nMy clients and know where they're at why because we have a plan and I'll tell you a lot of people tell me they said Kevin hike out a financial planner I'm fine look at this nice computer printout thing that I got him I said well that\nThat's like a computer generated plan right but really that's obsolete now because once he printed that or she printed that out for and gave it to you it's obsolete because none of that stuff's ever going to happen threat okay\nWe want to make sure that you're constantly understanding what's going on and I think that it's important to start trying to control the things that we can control when the things so when the things that are out of our country will happen they don't really affect us when the market drops Thirteen hundred points in two days right it's a lot it's a lot right\nThat it's not stirring something else to say I've lost all this money or what have you know I'm going to be fine because I've already controlled everything that I can control because I cannot control the market going up and down that\nLast week we were talking about volatility right you can control the volatility in your account and you know the big swings up in the big swings down we love the big swings up but we hate the big swing down when we see points like this uh Thirteen other points in two days\nOur memory just starts clicking in from those days that it was kind of fear ... truth out and an eight and you know you had ten years before you retired or Fifteen Years before you retired and he lost a lot of money now are then\nKevin loyalty is founder and CEO of a company called legacy wealth advisors and cause of the show with me called when retirement happens because retirement is going to happen are you going to be ready and if somebody is telling you that you know what let's worry about it when you retire [noise]\nThat's not the person you should be talking to Kevin Lloyd ...\nHas been talking about [laughter] you've already retired it's it's not too late you got someone you probably should talk to him about retiring before you got there right\nHow do I get to the store will first get to the store and when you get there then we'll talk about how to how to get to the store a either a when you\nGo to the website when we're time and a half of the dot com there's a lot of great resources Kevin talk about this this white paper you have this a retirement plan checklist\nWell it's it's really just designed to start kind of asking ourselves some questions long before he retired just say okay you have I looked at these certain things you know like like one of them says\nHey I'm during my accumulation years I've built up money in taxable tax deferred tax free accounts in the proper amount on the order to keep my taxes flexible in my distribution years it's just yes or no\nOkay so if you don't even know what I'm Talking about you probably should have had a conversation about the different types of you call them silos we are all different types of accounts taxable tax for tax free do we know how we're going to blend these withdrawals in retirement to keep our taxes as low as possible basically is what the question to ask him [noise]\nBut there's another question on here and this is where I think people really miss the mark\nI Need five thousand dollars a month right okay is that five thousand grows or is that ... this was this in my sweet spot it is I mean you think about the gross or not\nI don't know well I'm making sixty grand now so I Need sixty grand in retirement right but do you need sixty grand let me think about those folks let's see your net checks on sixty thousand dollars is\nTwenty five hundred dollars a month to earn thirty thirty grand half because I'm max it on my four one K. say for taxes and everything so you don't really need sixty gross you actually just need thirty thousand net or twenty five hundred dollars net or\nKnow I'm making a hundred and fifty but might take combs only like Ninety so really I didn't mean to Ninety right you always want to plan from the perspective why do you want to plan for the mess that perspective because seem if taxes go down like they just did we're in a better position\nIf taxes go up we're still in a good position because we've always plan from the amount of money that we actually can spend on a monthly basis\nBut here's another thing and this is on the questionnaire to I don't know what number it is\nI use my plan showing up four percent inflation now I'm seeing plans from well known firms have seen plans from other advisors running and they have two days cost of living which is around the Jewish percent you know we actually got caught two point eight percent\nThat is not what the historical long term average of inflation is it's actually four percent so why not playing with a four percent inflation\nWell here's the reason why who let's say the plan does seemed to work at four percent okay All right well that doesn't make me look good as an advisor that your plan doesn't work at four percent duck guessing they're thinking this\nMe I look at it saying I'm a fiduciary you need to know it doesn't work ... right right right it's not my fault\nI'm a ... year you need to know it doesn't work ... right right right it's not my fault you didn't have enough money that you're my fault that you're not you're not gonna work long enough to do this stuff but it doesn't even matter what matters is is that you know it\nAll right well yeah I'm going to plug it in the numbers to make it look good no plug in the real numbers though I Know what I'm looking at\nRight here so I had someone come into my office All right this person we put together the planet ... warm hypothetically\nWe put together this plan and I and I showed them that he probably shouldn't work at least three more years no he doesn't have to and I always say you don't have to you but this is what will probably happen if you do that if you work three more years you could go on even more vacations and you want to go on\nSo he says I Want to think about it because we always let everybody got everything he comes back in and we start talking a little bit and he said he said you know this whole time I want to let you know I've been seeing X Y Z companies want to see that that's great he goes I think I'm going to go with them\nAnd I said well tell me why you're going to go with them he said because you told me I had worked three they told me I can retire right now\n\nSo if I Would have told you what you want to hear you will use us I don't even want to but it does it make sense does it it just doesn't make sense and so I just said well let me just ask you one question [laughter]\nWhen you sat down with them and you win over your financial planning these shows you condemn inflation could average four percent what did that look like and they said well they said inflation's only two percent but\nIt is now ... and it works now but what do you do when it doesn't work so you're playing probably works it let's say even think you've got to plan\nIt works today but what do you do when it doesn't you know your your accounts for going up what do you do when they don't see that is really scary it is I mean it's it's very scary because see in advisors the our view\nIs when the markets screaming growth right it's when it turned upside down you need your advice or the most when things aren't going so well in the economy you need your advice or the most when taxes increase you need your advice or there\nAs a counselor I was meeting hypothetically was someone just the other day and they said this is like a counseling session in I said well that's pretty much all of our ... our our lights ... sessions because I'm here with you in the good times and the bad times and I want to try to help you out as much as possible make sure you makes our choices about money because sometimes we don't\nSometimes we make decisions that just parked good at all for us\nBut no matter if it's good or bad I Want my clings to know what would happen if they do make that decision me I don't judge whatever you want to do is perfectly fine with me but you know what's happening if you're informed\nNothing making an educated decision of rising market hides a lot of mistakes rising\nMarket raises all boats right right right right so right Joes though if you're if you're ... your numbers or you're not right or if you're not really dive in deep end of this\nUm you haven't been caught with your pants down because they're because the markets are going through the roof you're not caught with your pants down to your car with your parents are right right right I mean you're not an outdoors two thousand and eight and you got your your upside down an old guy or\nGal told me just to hold on [noise] yeah right right or wrong doesn't make a difference here's the thing let's say you did want to hold on in two thousand and eight\nWill be better make some lemonade out of these lemons right right what if I Move my IRA to a Roth IRA you know what your balances are right now what if that's all one hundred percent tax free right\nWhat if it was only portion of it then you move to the Ross could have done something like that in two thousand they in fact here's the funny thing you think about two thousand eight down thirty seven percent next year it's up like twenty six percent or so [noise] All right so that's two thousand nine now you're in two thousand and ten Obama announces this\nPeople over the age of Seventeen and a half do not have to take a required minimum distribution did he say that yeah yeah yeah he actually gave us a pretty good gift he said further more um here's what they did is they said you can move your IRA to a raw fire ray and the tax bill for this year in twenty ten will be zero\nNow you do after you incorporate that in your tax return and twenty eleven and twenty twelve so let's say I move a hundred grand\nI Would have shown fifty percent of that fire fifty grand the next year in eleven and then the next year and twelve over the show and fifty thousand dollars will that hunter might have been two fifty three hundred could be for depending upon what I was the best you could be could be less if it was All right there but ... you know\nNot much money so\nSo he gave you a chance to grow your money tax free after paying the fifty thousand dollars in tax\nYes and I was in a meeting one time and I heard a guy talking about this you know it was like a couple of years ago and I'm In the front row listening to this guy and he goes who did it it was always I was in the room who did it for their clients\nAnd I'm thinking yeah it was probably a lot of us a turnaround there is not a single person that raise their hands right and I raised my hand I said I did I Can't believe you guys didn't do that for your client right now it doesn't mean that everyone should have done it right but\nBased on how many claims you got you probably at least had won or who right right right right right right on the X amount of people you at I'm sure some of them would have benefited from this right have you ever seen anybody get mad because they get tax free money no\nNo I said just as one of the things I have not seen that Kevin ... had been here five fifty Katie are as we sort of demystify retirement really that's what the show was we just demystify were time it's because there's a lot of questions there's a lot of banks there's a lot of fear and isn't it interesting and this is\nA troubled marketing right and this volatile market all Kevin clients are not worried all the ones who are not as clients are worried\nThat that guy that got really say if I go with this other guy I I can retire now\nYeah oh yeah you know that's a true story I Will call the hypothetical kind of thing but here's the thing that's a great story aren't worry free right okay it's just that there are more comfortable knowing that they have things that\nWhen you're doing financial planning to try to control the things you can control so many things that happened that are out of our control happened they don't affect us as bad\nWhile I'm showing you how to maximize your fixed income so building that foundation to your plan is very very important and sometimes we get wrong information from the Social Security office threat they're given wrong information don't you think your advice or could give you the wrong information\nAlright so his wife he was married to his wife ... years ago he is now single ... ... ... let's say his wife remarried does it matter no does when he doesn't remarry so as long as he does and remarry he still has access to her benefits yes correct act after she turned sixty to\nCorrect as long as she's the up age to get it right this example to search echo down because she doesn't even know she doesn't even know church check here's the thing what is his check was only like\nFive hundred bucks right still could have got that spouse for weeks at six hundred and twelve hundred dollar example\nBut here's the thing if she dies and he's still on married his check would go up to whatever her check was or or vice versa ... bigger and she was on married still right and he died her check with jumped up and we said his check was two thousand so her check would have went up from like twelve hundred to two thousand dollars\nIt's kinda cool how this works I mean like for example let's say that I'm married\nFor ten years I get a divorce marry for another ten years I get a divorce I'm married to my current wife my checks two thousand dollars a month we'll say they're all full retirement age yeah they all get a thousand dollars a month it doesn't affect mine doesn't affect their and then when I die the only two thousand bucks which really getting some money on Social Security right is\nFigure out how to get married a bunch of ties in to do that so the the reward for staying married ten years is you get access to their Social Security yeah so if you're getting ready to get a divorce and you got nine and a half old on maybe you need to stretch it out she\nStill a little bit because you know sometimes you know like like my wife she stopped working really long time ago and she's not going to work\nEver again unless you really wants to you and I don't see that happening but she may and let's see that we were getting a divorce and we're only married like nine and a half years she might need my half of my Social Security check right now I've been married a lot longer than that and\nBeen together with my wife a lot longer than that we're not going to get a divorce but still\nI think it's important and I think attorneys Mrs too 'cause I had someone come in my office one time he said yeah we waited the ten years I'm ... till she turned age sixty before we got married because she still keep her widow's benefits okay which is a different completely different role here\nAnd I said well you wait till she turned sixty but you're only like four months behind her wedding you wait till you turned sixty so you can keep your widow's benefits as well and he's like well he didn't think about that right\nBy the way it used to a point of a correction your uh your wife doesn't work uh outside of the home\nYou know what she's probably listening right now and I appreciate you saying that\nHer job as a heck of a lot harder to the allies yes she will not you might not work outside the home I couldn't do that to save you used to when you go home tonight you don't get in trouble saying that's right and that is a good idea I\nI Am here for your cold outside it might have access to our benefits which are not going to have access to to the house there were those ah what is the baby to the baby's due\nRight around that first second week in December she is ready to get this baby out right now you know or I she's I mean if\nIf if if it if it was healthy tissue take her in ... states are now back last week we were talking about the baby and I said you know we have a name picked up but we haven't told anybody and they're not gonna theme of the great she goes she goes uh [noise]\nI Can't believe you said they don't care what if somebody is listening because we told them don't have any will you liked him I didn't [laughter] that's\nKevin Lloyd a and his lovely wife um and his office number three and four six four one tent and three one for six for one tent and really interesting stuff about things you can control in retirement as opposed to things you can't control I Want to go back to our next segment I Want to ask you about\nControlling taxes because I'm not retired\nAnd I can't really control my taxes will come back and talk about that that is Kevin Lloyd immigrant Milly having the website when retirement happens dot com [noise]\nOpinions you hear on the T. R. S. are those are the host callers and gas and and that's a fairly those visitation is management or orders that commenters the Gaskins contact is again the R. S. dot com thanks for listening [noise]\nOr oh\nKevin Lloyd ... five fifty K. T. R. S. website when retirement happens his office phone number three one for six for one ten ten what are you waiting for\nThe call Kevin and start your plan start on the road to get a plan for retirement and become one of Kevin's clients who are not\nFreaking out the rest of us are freaking out but not Kevin clients and by the way when I realized that I'm within five years of retirement I Will be calling him a bus that we'd all be waiting for that phone call [laughter]\nThree one for six for one tent and All right I'll go back something you said last segment about controlling things you can control and and not worry about things you can't control like the markets right the markets go up to market to go down I Can't control it but you said we can control taxes now that's interesting because\nUm I guess for the most part you can't control taxes because you got to pay taxes so explain what you mean when you talk about controlling taxes in retirement we've always heard\nAbout death and taxes right died to fight the IRS actually does spell there's we we know all this stuff right we got to pay tax so I'm thinking about one of my clients hypothetically where\nWe help and maximize or Social Security set up this entire plan and now they're at that spot where she's all like Tina her Social Security benefits and um [noise]\nWe we start talking about taxes again and I've been doing this all time high Kevin I Know you've been talking about this but what's our tax bill going to be I said well we're look let me show you here's here's where you're at and\nI said well here look let me show you know here's here's where you're at and this is your tax bill me sitting in it and\nIt says zero I said I Know it's a zero yeah but no no I'm I'm seriously how much tax should we pay how much should we do what you do or quarterly estimates work right no no you don't have to do any quarterly essence in fact you will never pay tax ever again in your life\nHow did we do that and I certainly remember all those strategies when I was pulling money from this account and I stopped in a pool of money from this account my stops it and we started doing this one\nAnd he's like yeah I understood all that stuff 'cause you're trying to lower taxes and retirement but I but I don't think I ever really thought that it was going to be really zero threat you know it was going to be zero and I don't believe he goes\nYeah that's great [laughter] I'm like yeah no it is good because see\nYou folks have paid way more than your fair share of taxes and some of you paid even more than your fair share of taxes on some of them didn't pay anything at all okay but for people that we work with I think that they'd be more taxes and they should have\nAnd when we get to retirement I don't think that we should have to pay taxes at all but what happens is is we save our money in these wrong spots\nLike four O. one K. plants yes I'm seeing\nFor all in case you can have too much money in those accounts and they can cause huge tax liabilities\nDown the road and I hear other advisors I listen to him they say ... third gross don't worry about it but I Would have taken money our Seventy and they have as role won a keep doing it yeah that's how I was trained ... oh straight hey take take Social Security as early as possible\nDelay you're Irish to have to start taking money out when you do to take it out and put it in a tax will count don't spend it just let it grow you get all this to for growth and I'm like\nYou know that sounds good but I'd rather have a tax for tax free tax for taxable taxable taxable taxable\nAnd what happens is is because people start saving all these moneys in his four one K. accounts of this distribution starts getting bigger from these IRAs folks it's not four percent when you're forced to take money out of your IRA play on it's not four percent\nI don't care what your advisor said everybody thinks that you have to take out four percent that is not true in fact\nI don't even think if I can think of a time when it's exactly four percent at all alright\nIt starts off a little lower and it goes much much higher\nThink about this somebody had a million dollars each sixty six will seem six percent growth they got to take out a hundred and one thousand dollars out of their account\nIt's a lot of money but when I went on a eighty two years old it's eighty eight if I'm if I'm Seventy eight it was Seventy two thousand [noise] the thing is is you know it's not four percent you're this amount to starts off at a lower amount and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger\nAnd bigger gas and you haven't planned for your taxes are going to actually\nGo up so let's think about what's going on right now in the in the U.S okay we just changed taxes we just change the brackets if you're working your paycheck got a little bit of a boost depending upon how much you make is how much a boost she got\nSo we went from higher taxes last year to lower taxes today and the brackets got wider\nIn fact you can go all the way up to three hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars of income which is a lot of money and still only be in the twenty four percent tax bracket you're in the twenty five percent tax bracket as a married couple of filing jointly anything over approximately a hundred thousand last year\nHe do another hundred and thirty not two hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars on only pay twenty four twenty five right\nCom that's Patty spelled P.

give it away access to the MLS you looking\nFor property [noise] you need to use the program I Do the MLS each free there is no obligation you can turn it on you can turn it off you can do whatever you want you can turn me on well maybe not but you should turn me off\nJust hit the dial anyway the MLS let you search for property using the same mechanism that Terry how the great and wonderful real estate ... uses [noise]\nHow's the long title winded me but I like it anyway instead of things like real dot com and a fellow they just put houses up there so that you can look at him and like them\nAnd by the way they're already sold ...\nNow you can use the mechanism I Do because I Can't afford to talk to you about properties that are already so unless we're getting ready to ride an offer and we need to look at the salt index digress anyway [noise] you wouldn't access to the MLS here's how you get it three one for nine\nSix nine five eight seven seven that's nine six nine to five eight seven\nSeven ... four of you have at this hour\nNot literally you just get to use it for Ninety Days and then if you like it I'll give you another Ninety Days because there's never cost there's never an obligation free access to the last\nThree wasn't born nine six nine five eight seven seven or info at cherry hauled dot net firemen are spectacular mood today I Hope you are to actually\nWhen I get ready for the show I get excited suddenly mornings I listen to the case she classics cause some ... ...\nAnd then I write the show now the question is do I pay attention to what I write and then I come in and joined I pick out the music so I figured out job was to find it see if I spelled anything right or wrong yup yup so\nI was looking at a couple with cup ball for a piece of property and ... and here's how we did the homework on at first we went through the house and it was great it was a beautiful house right\nQuestion is what does it work what they asked so I did the soldiers in ... there were five homes in the subdivision that have sold recently and when I did my ultimate comparison which can only be done by me ...\nAll right I Know it and get your hip waiters or it might be one of those shows are [noise] um anyway [noise]\nI'll interview my ... my contact my wonderful dissertation because Joe says Tom's on the phone we sure as heck don't what Tom holding hello Tom you're on this week in real estate how can I help you\n\nYes sir my better when you're reading [noise] [noise]\nOh that'd be nice yeah I'm always ready for dinner\nNo bread my white flour and no or sugar

looking for dinner or you could call three one nine nine\nAnd for dinner you can call three one oh nine ... nine five eight seven seven I mean not desperate I'd just be a little bit off today All right um so we're back to looking at this property there were five salts\nAnd uh um three of them are far more expensive but one was really close\nAnd we did the comparison so\nThe house we're looking at headed three car garage the house to solve this is the identical same size had her two car garage the house that uh we're interested in had the original cabinets but I think they had new faces put on them and and maybe they had heard of I've Formica countertop upgrade I don't know\nNo one knew what to do when I'm inspections were done and repairs needed to be done and what about the appraiser and how about that the title companies got to coordinate both buyer and seller\nThe building inspection human discipline inspection to terminate inspection half of them are required by um [noise]\nThe lender so it's just a complicated mess and ah and if the ... the seller should and has to me sometimes said ... doing that\nWell I tell my buyers can get two choices you can pay me to do it for you and let him flounder\nPour pour\nCan do by yourself I'm okay with that this is America landed the free and home of the brave [laughter] which by the way the veterans radio network comes on it too that was smooth the veterans radio network with me and this time this week I'm doing the show by myself\nI'll be alone but anyway I tell the buyers it's okay for them to uh buy from him what if we hire you you can do that\nToo [laughter] so there's no reason as a buyer you need to be afraid of proof for sale by owner there's no readers and as a first sale by on or that you need to be afraid of a realtor [laughter]\nYou just work and it All right you're just work and the problem that's all and if you approach it that way without getting a lot of emotion and all of this other stuff it involved then in almost\nUniversal uh almost universally\nEverybody gets what they want southern gets the money they needed buyer gets the house they wanted to price that's affordable for them and uh I get paid a lot less and I don't know I don't look back and I don't care\nI enjoy what I Do I enjoy the people that I work with I ... I really enjoyed the listeners the radio program because you are my friends\nAll right so where you use the term like Lincoln loosely whatever you want to call it but my considering\nAnd my friends when I get on the Mike each Sunday [laughter] it's like man you talking about what you're going to do with your property and how were you were going to save money in the best way possible [noise]\nAll right so let's take a quick break I got to remind you I've got three of those see amaze left and only two of you get access to the MLS three months or nine six Ninety five eight seven seven that's nine six nine five eight seven seven or email me at in\nSo I NFO cat Terry halt T.

[laughter] we're back to\nRead the state so we raised the commission on this house on the property that he wanted me to sell to stand on butler him [noise] and the amount of agents have substantially increased to showing and and that's kind of how you got to sell our home\nNinety Days [noise] we hit a button and you get another Ninety Days free access to the MLS search for property of the way I Do three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven that's nine six nine five eight seven seven [noise]\nSo ah let's talk a little bit about if you're going to put your house you're going to put your house on the market in the spring All right\nGuess what\nIn the spring first time buyers dominate dominate this spring housing markets and I mean my gosh I'm\nFifty one percent of the total agency purchase business is first time homebuyers no kidding and ... and this is some great information so for instance I'm\nA\nCredit scores that range between five Ninety and the average uh seven fifty five a high end\n\nTheir loan rates range in the stores\n[noise] there is a substantial amount of people who read Pete\nMeaning they use the same loan like an F ha loan All right so the first time ... two hundred and three thousand of them in the first quarter repeat buyers used out fake loans two hundred and twenty seven thousand times\nSo what does that mean that me usually means when you get into a house you are a few years your savings you've got and you've landed right you've landed [noise]\nNow you got to make that new house payment and you used an F ha loan to get in for only a moderate amount of money or if you're a BA veteran you do use no money to get in or if you're doing a U.S and be a loan and you income qualify\nYou're not using any or money to do that either\nSo what do you expect as a cellar\nTo see on a contract for the first time buyer well you're going to see a buyer asking far use this salary to pay closing costs ... ...\n... it used to be in the eyes and band nobody paid my damn closing cause I imperative for nobody else soccer go out and get some more money [noise]\nWell that's a bright rosy attitude isn't it that don't get you a lot of buyers coming into your house and gee that vinegar worked really well and you wonder five months later while your house is still for sale\n... and ... what you might look at is this scenario\nHow will just use a moderate whatever will use a hundred and fifty thousand dollars because everybody can do that mass right hundred and fifty thousand art\nBuyers need about three percent or whatever the sale price is so hundred and fifty thousand dollars they need five grand from you and you're saying oh damn and they want to and they want to\nAnd you knew that in your price you basically add five grand where the negotiation room so they come in five grand below this price and then they want the closing costs paid which is another five ... five ... five grand is ten grand\n[noise] home we're not doing getting the money we wanted okay well here's what you would do is the seller\nYou just raised the sale price to compensate for the closing costs the buyer need because two things have happened here [noise] you've given the buyer what\nThey need so they can go ahead and with the purchase of your home and you're giving yourself like you need which is the amount of money you want to walk away with when you sell that home\nOkay\nSo remembered that southerners you need to catch the buyers fits under two hundred grand actually if it's under two hundred and fifty grand fires are most likely going to ask for closing costs so you'd just do the math [laughter]\nIt's like getting to the moon oh that's a little bit tougher math but the point is you just do the math and say okay we're going to come in at this and you say oh what about the appraisal Terry O L prayer was amazed all\nThe praise it gets a copy of the sales contract the listing edgy goes in and changes the list price to accommodate the new price 'cause I like I said the president gets a copy of the sales contract and what his job is to do is to show that the banks risk is minimal\n[noise] so and this contract the same house appraised added a hundred and fifty 'cause that's what the sales contract showed but that contract falls through it goes by the wayside the second offer is for a hundred and fifty five ... five grand and closing costs\nIt's amazing how that price just a house just increased five thousand dollars in value\nIn four weeks but didn't\nThe risk is still the same for the lender okay appraisal is not rocket science it's an evaluation by the bank to show their risk is high or low [noise]\nHow do you like that that may be something you didn't know in a refinance appraisals even crazier especially if you want to cash out they look at your credit report and see what your credit score is and see if you've been paying your bills that's how they make a decision about that one\nSo you don't trust to refinance appraisals and I guess\nYou can trust a home or ... but I don't know but uh you know because they can change\nSo what does this all mean [noise] well [noise]\nAnd that's a very deep subject well what it means is\nA house is worth what someone's willing to pay for it to okay okay so the next week I'm going to put up two pieces of property actually three\nThat were vastly over priced\nSettlers even knew that they felt that the agent was putting the priced too high but they didn't speak up or maybe they didn't and they want with what the agent said shame on you Mr seller and Mrs Taylor you are the employer\n\nJust one case the house was easily forty thousand dollars overpriced\nEasily and this was a big beautiful home\nIt was a set up power switching everybody went through that and then looked at other houses of this\nBut it was a set up power switching everybody went through that and then looked at other houses of the same price range and set up for that I get a lot more these other homes [noise] another one was\nTwenty thousand dollars over ... ... if they really like the ... they will send me an offer\nOh no they won't most people don't want to offend the seller so they think if the Senate ... match for the house that they don't want to send them enough for that low because ... they don't want to offend them\nWhich is crazy but it's how the market work another one is an easy forty five thousand dollars overpriced why'd they get their well houses so that way [noise] [noise]\nIt's all in the math it's all in what you get shown it's all how you make the decision as the sellers charmed baton even though it's late fall we're going to put those houses on the market and I bet they will sell if the seller lists them however as I tell all of my sellers\nI'm an employer ... All right that's right I'm an employee\nI Do what I'm told I tell the boss what I think and the boss tells me what they want to do you feed the boss attract\nYou'll be you'll be he she be and he'd be\nWhatever be much my point which might point my point is when you're putting your house up for sale especially in a market like Japan and it isn't selling is being shoulder and Archie and blah blah blah\nYou kind of sit down with a realtor and that's one of the biggest problem people have is they say my realtor never talks to me well I'll bet they talk\nTo you if you say hey man I Want out of his contract you're stuck on the air and you're not doing your job and I'm not happy who bet you'll get some conversation then ...\nYou [noise] alright stopped preaching Terry I'm not I'm just trying to teach you the [noise]\nLanguage and the understanding of buying and selling your home so you get the most money for your home with the least amount of work and if you're buying you get into a home for the least amount of money yeah at a good fair price tag you're listening to this week in real estate I've got\nTwo of those ... evaluation you want to find out whether you're home is\nProbably
