year\nAs of now we're done I'm taking the holidays off for probably ... sometime in January but we won't announce it till sometime in December but the last workshop we just hand\nIt was packed good you know again to all we're doing is trying to help people figure out how you can get money out of your accounts that you've never pay tax on tax free right\nTrying to show how to maximize Social Security you know with the market drawn to him and everything that's been going on sometimes when you have a plan to just makes you feel a heck of a lot more comfortable\nAbsolutely yeah All right so here's what to do since you can't get into any more attacks seminars this year you can go to the website when retirement happens dot com\nOr the website is great it's a great place to go for great resources and you can register get on a waiting list and a village you know the next attack seminar now also on that Web sites where you have all sorts of why papers will will get to this checklist hearing the second but you said something to me before he went on air which I thought was kind of interesting\nUh and picking up on something we've talked about last week all your clients you know you might get one or two that mark has been somewhat of all over the last couple of weeks and a one or two your clients my call up and say hey what are we doing this and that but you said something interesting all your clients are okay\nThere you train them you've educated them they know what's going on but it's the people who aren't working with you friends family people stop you know the street they're the ones all freaking out over this deal\nYou know I think a lot of people are freaking out over what happened in the market when you see a two day drop over Thirteen hundred points you start to wonder you\nWere my count looks like looking at those statements coming in or I haven't even now I'm Down to this much money I thought I was going to retire in a year or three years from now\nI have a lot less money than I had before but the thing is I mean is it I mean you think about fear right fear really starts when we don't know what's going on when the unknown is there and wait and windows to meet together\nIt really starts panic right I'm just going to sell right or I'm I'm gonna work five more years or or what have you but here's the thing do we really know where we're at\nMy clients knew where they're at why because we have a plan and I'll tell you a lot of people tell me they said Kevin Hi kind of financial plan I'm fine look at this nice computer printout thing that makes it a little bit [laughter]\nThat's like a computer generated plan right but really that's obsolete now because once he printed that or she printed it out for and gave it to you it's obsolete because none of that stuff's ever going to happen right okay\nWe want to make sure that you're constantly understanding what's going on and I think that it's important to start trying to control the things that we can control when their things so when the things that are out of our country will happen they don't really affect us when the market drops Thirteen hundred points in two days right it's a lot it's a lot right\nThat it's not stirring something up to say I've lost all this money or what have you know I'm going to be fine because that's already controlled everything that I can control because I cannot control the market going up and down right last week we were talking about volatility right you can control the volatility\nWe're talking about volatility right you can control the volatility in your account you know the big swings up in the big swings down we love the big swings up but we hate the big swing them out and when we see points like this uh Thirteen other points in two days\nOur memory just starts clicking in from those days that it was kind of fear ... two thousand and eight and you know you had ten years before you retired or Fifteen Years before he retired and he lost a lot of money now then\nWait until you see a two thousand and eight happen again in the future because you have a heck of a lot more money now than you had in two thousand laid right at least you should if you don't\n... we got to talk [laughter] about it but it but but but what's interesting is the only people are freaking out of the people who are working with you which I find quite interesting well that's because I think\nThe reason it is because they actually have a financial plan and their\nSleeping well at night knowing I Know the good the bad the ugly I this is the plan and this is part of the plan we planned for this\nI'm going to bed you're fine and here's the thing call me anyways even if you got questions call me we're going to automatically call you within Ninety a hundred days to review your financial plan and folks if you're not review and your financial playing every Ninety to a hundred days face to face with your advice or\nYou probably should okay in a lot of people say well you want to see him once a year\nAnd what are we going to talk about you know because here's the thing when I talk to people that come into my office before their clients and say well how often are you mean with their cars\nHave so you need to check out in ... store dot com that's income store dot\nCom is your whole mess linking concrete maybe the steps and maybe the driveways sidewalk or patio don't listen ... still value or curb appeal for your whole for claims another victim basements system we said sink in Congress safely and neatly with Sally

you can do this or don't be and why why do and as I sold dot com for your free sample today uses directed\nA law\nKevin Lloyd he is the founder and CEO of a company called legacy wealth advisors and goes to the show with me called when retirement happens because retirement is going to happen are you going to be ready and if somebody is telling you that you know what let's worry about it when you retire [noise]\nThat's not the person you should be talking to Kevin Lloyd ...\nHas been talking about [laughter] you've already retired it's it's not too late you got someone you probably should talk to him about retiring before you got there right\nHow do I get to the store will first get to the store and when you get there then we'll talk about how you how to how to get to the store to eat right when you go to the website\nWhen we're time and a half of the dot com there's a lot of great resources Gavin talk about this this white paper you have this a retirement plan checklist\nWell it's it's really just designed to start kind of asking ourselves some questions long before he retired just say okay you have I looked at these certain things you know like like one of them says\nHey I'm during my accumulation years I've built up money in taxable taxes for tax free accounts in the proper amount in order to keep my taxes flexible in my distribution years it's just yes or no\nOkay so if you don't even know what I'm Talking about you probably should have had a conversation about the different type you call them silos we are all different types of accounts taxable tax deferred tax free do we know how we're going to blend these withdrawals in retirement to keep our taxes as low as possible basically is what that question to ask him [noise]\nBut there's another question here and this is where I think people really miss the mark\nI Need five thousand dollars a month right okay\nIs that five thousand grows or is that ... this is this in my sweet spot it is I mean you think about that is a grocer next\nI don't know\nWell I'm making sixty grand now so I Need sixty grand in retirement right but do you need sixty grand let me think about this folks [noise] let's see your net checks on sixty thousand dollars is\nTwenty five hundred dollars a month to earn thirty thirty grand half because I'm actually on my four one K. say ... percent in taxes and everything so you don't really need sixty gross you actually just need thirty thousand net or twenty five hundred\nSixty gross you actually just need\nThirty thousand net or twenty five hundred dollars net or you know I'm making a hundred and fifty but might take comes only like Ninety so really I just need to Ninety right you always want to plan from that perspective why do you want to plan for the mess that perspective\nBecause seem if taxes go down like they just did we're in a better position\nIf taxes go up we're still in a good position because we always plan from the amount of money that we actually can spend on a monthly basis\nBut here's another thing and this is on the questionnaire to I don't know what number it is\nI use my plan showing a four percent inflation now I'm seeing plans from well known ferns I've seen plans from other advisors running that today's cost of living which is around the Jewish percent you know we actually got caught two point eight percent\nThat is not what the historical long term average of inflation is it's actually four percent so why not playing with a four percent inflation\nWell here's the reason why who\nLet's say the plan doesn't work at four percent okay well that doesn't make me look good as an advisor that you're playing doesn't work at four percent darned guessing they're thinking this\nMe I look at it saying I'm a fiduciary you need to know it doesn't work in Iraq or Iran right it's not my fault you didn't have enough money it's not your my fault that you're not you're not gonna work long enough to do this stuff but it doesn't even matter what matters is is that you know it\nRight well yeah I'm going to plug it in the numbers to make it look good no plug in the real numbers so I Know what I'm looking at\nRight here so I had someone come into my office by this person we put together the plan on going to be warm hypothetically\nWe put together this plan and I and I showed them that he probably shouldn't work at least three more years you know he doesn't have to and I always say you don't have to you but this is what will probably happen if you do that if you work three more years you could go on even more vacations and you want to go on [noise]\nSo he says I Want to think about it I said well that's fine because we always let everybody out everything he comes back in and we started talking a little bit and he said he said you know this whole time I want to let you know I've been seeing X Y Z company as well to us is that's great he goes I think I'm going to go with them\nAnd said well tell me why you're going to go with them he said because you told me I had worked three they told me I could retire right now\n\nSo if I Would have told you what you want to hear you I Will use us I don't even want to tell you why not [laughter] it doesn't make sense does it it just doesn't make sense and so I just said well let me just ask you one question\nWhen you sat down with him and he went over your financial planning these shows you that the inflation crude average four percent what did that look like and they said well they said inflation's only two percent for it\nBecause it is now ... and it works now but what do you do when it doesn't work so you're playing probably works at let's say even if you think you've got to plant\nIt works today but what do you do when it does that you know your your accounts were going up what do you do when they don't see that is really scary it is I mean it's it's very scary because see in advisors V. our you\nIsn't it when the markets screaming growth right it's when it turns upside down you need your advice or the most when things are going so well in the economy you need your advice or the most twin taxes increase you need your advice or there\nAs a counselor I was meeting hypothetically was someone just the other day and they said this is like a counseling session in I said well that's pretty much all of our staff meetings are are like ... sessions because\nI'm here with you in the good times and the bad times and I want to try to help you out as much as possible make sure you makes our choices about money because sometimes we don't sometimes we make decisions that just aren't good at all for us\nBut no matter if it's good or bad\nI Want my clients to know what would happen if they do make that decision me I don't judge whatever you want to do is perfectly fine with me but you know what's happening if you're informed\nNothing making an educated decision are rising market hides a lot of mistakes rising\nMarket raises all boats ... right so right so so if your if your hedging your numbers are you are not right and we are if you're not really dive in deep into this\nUm you haven't been caught with your pants down because they're because the markets are going through the roof you're not caught with your pants down to your car with your parents right right right I mean you're not as though it's two thousand and eight and you got your your upside down and all that guy or\nGal told me just to hold on yeah right man right or wrong doesn't make a difference here's the thing let's say you did want to hold on and two thousand and eight\nWill be better make some lemonade out of these lemons right right what if I Move my IRA to a Roth IRA you know what your balances are right now what if that's all one hundred percent tax free right\nWhat if it was only portion of it then you move to the Ross could have done something like that in two thousand may in fact here's the funny thing you think about two thousand eight down thirty seven percent next year it's up like twenty six percent or so All right so that's two thousand nine now you're in two thousand and ten Obama announces this\nPeople over the age of Seventeen and a half to you know it has to take a required minimum distribution did he say that yeah yeah yeah he actually gave us a pretty good gift he said further more um here's what they did is they said you can move your IRA too raw fire ray and the tax bill for this year in twenty ten will be zero\nNow you do after you incorporate that in your tax return and twenty ... twenty twelve so let's say I move a hundred grand\nI Would have shown fifty percent of that fire fifty grand [noise] the next year and eleven and then the next year and twelve I Would have shown fifty thousand dollars for that hundred might've been two fifty three hundred could before depending upon what I was the best you could we could be less if it was All right there but but you know\nNot much on anything soft money\nSo so he gave you a chance to grow your money tax free after paying the fifty thousand dollars in tax\nFor four years till we turned Seventy right All right so he's going to pick up forty eight thousand dollars not even including cost of living adjustments 'cause it would be more\nThan switch back to his checking his check is guaranteed to be two thousand six hundred and forty dollars per month so it goes up six hundred and forty dollars a month if you have cost of living adjustments in there and we could be close to twenty eight twenty nine hundred dollars a month\nWhen you're doing financial planning to try to control the things you can control suing the things that happened that are out of our control happen they don't affect us as bad while I'm showing you how to maximize your fixed income so building that foundation to your plan is very very important\nAnd sometimes we get wrong information from these Social Security office right they're given wrong information don't you think your advice or could give you the wrong information\nAll right so his wife he was married to his wife years ago he's now single ... ... ... let's say his wife remarried does it matter now does he doesn't remarry so as long as he doesn't remarry he still has access to her or benefits\nYes correct act after she turned sixty to correct as long as she's the age to get it right in this example to search the echo down because she doesn't even know she doesn't even a church check here's the thing what if he's check was only like\nFive hundred bucks right still could have got that spousal for weeks at six hundred and twelve hundred dollar example\nBut here's the thing if she dies and he's still on Mary his check would go up to whatever her check was or or vice versa ... bigger and she was on marriage still right and he died her check with jumped up and we said his check with two thousand so her check would have went up from like twelve hundred to two thousand dollars\nIt's kinda cool how this works I mean like for example let's say that I'm married\nFor ten years I get a divorce and marriage for another ten years ago to divorce I'm married to my current wife my checks two thousand dollars a month we'll say they're all full retirement age yeah they all get a thousand dollars or not it doesn't affect mine doesn't affect their and then when I die they all get two thousand bucks when it's really getting some money on Social Security right is figure out how to get married a bunch of times and\nThey do that so the the reward for staying married ten years is you get access to their\nSocial Security yeah so if you're getting ready to get a divorce and you've got nine and a half years old on maybe you're not even out she still a little bit because you know sometimes you know like like my wife she stopped working really long time ago and she's not going to work\nEver again unless you really wants to write I don't see that happening but she may and let's see if we were getting a divorce and we're only married like nine and a half years she might need my half of my Social Security check right now I've been married a lot longer than that and\nBeen together with my wife a lot longer than that we're not going to get a divorce but still I think it's important and I think attorneys Mrs too because I had someone come in my office one time he said yeah we waited the ten years I'm dark 'til 'til she turned age sixty before we got married because she's still keep her widow's benefits okay which is a different completely different role here\nAnd I said well you wait till she turned sixty but you're only like four months behind her wedding you wait till you turned sixty so you can keep your widow's benefits as well and he's like he didn't think about that right\nBy the way it used to a point of a correction here or your wife doesn't work uh outside of the home\nYou know what she's probably listening right now and I appreciate you saying that\nHer job as a heck of a lot harder the hours yes she will not you might not work outside the home if I couldn't do that to save used when you go home tonight you don't get in trouble saying that's right and that is a good idea I I Am here for your cold outside and not that I\nMight have access to our benefits but you're not going to have access to to the house there were those kind of uh what is the baby the baby do\nRight around that first second week in December she is ready to get this baby out right now you know I wore I she's I mean if\nIf if if it if it was healthy tissue take her in ... states are now in fact last week we were talking about the baby and I said you know we have a name picked up where we haven't told anybody and you're not going to the ... and she goes she goes\nInto an air what if somebody is listening because we told them don't have any women he liked him I didn't [laughter] that's\nKevin Lloyd a and his lovely wife um and his office numbers through in four six four one tent and three or four six four one tent and really interesting stuff about things you can control in retirement as opposed to things you can't control I Want to go back\nTo our next segment on ask about controlling taxes because I'm not retired and I can't really control my taxes so we'll come back and talk about that That's Kevin Lloyd immigrant Milly having the website when retirement happens dot com [noise]\nFive fifty online on demand [noise]\nOr\nThat Kevin ... haven't been five fifty K. T. R. S. website when retirement happens his office phone number three one for six for one ten ten what are you waiting for\nThe call Kevin and start your plan start on the road to get a plan for retirement and become one of Kevin's clients who are not freaking out the rest of us are freaking out but not Kevin Kline so by the way\nWhen I realized that I'm within five years of retirement I Will be calling him a better to be waiting for that phone call [laughter] three\nOne for six for one tent and All right I'll go back something you said last segment about controlling things you can control and and not worry about things you can't control like the markets right the markets go up the markets go down I Can't control it but you said we can control taxes now that's interesting because\nUm I guess for the most part you can't control taxes because you've got to pay taxes so explain what you mean when you talk about controlling taxes in retirement\nWe've always heard about death and taxes right died tax write the IRS actually does ... mean we know all this stuff right we got to pay tax so I'm thinking about one of my clients hypothetically where\nWe help and maximize or Social Security set up this entire plan and now they're at that spot where she's all like teen her Social Security benefits and um [noise]\nWe we started talking about taxes again and I've been doing this all time high Kevin I Know you've been talking about this what\nAnd about taxes again and I've been doing this whole time Kevin I Know you've been talking about to say what's our tax bill gonna be\nI said well here look let me show you here's here's where you're at ... and this is your tax bill missing in it and\nIt says zero I said I Know it's a zero given no no how seriously how much tax should we pay how much should we do what what should we do our quarterly estimates mark right no no you don't have to do any quarterly essence in fact you will never pay tax ever again in your life\nHow did we do that and I certainly remember all those strategies when I was pulling money from this account then I stopped in that poll money from this account to stop it and we started doing this one and he's like yeah I understood all that stuff 'cause you're trying to lower taxes in retirement but I but I don't think I ever really thought that it was going to be really zero right\nYou know there was going to be zero and I don't believe it he goes\nYeah that's great [laughter] I'm like yeah I Know it is good because see you folks have paid\nWay more than your fair share of taxes and some of you paid even more than your fair share of taxes on some of them didn't pay anything at all okay but for people that we work with I think that they'd be more taxes than they should have and when we get to retirement I don't think that we should have to pay taxes at all but\nWhat happens is we save our money in these wrong spots\nLike four o one K plan yes I'm seeing\nFor rowing case you can have too much money in those accounts and they can cause huge tax liabilities down the road and I hear other advisors I listened to him they say different growth don't worry about a ... page taking money out semi they have a room want to keep doing it yeah that's how I was ... I was trained hey take take Social Security as early as possible\nDelay your IRA so you have to start taking money out when you do just take it out and put it in tax will kind of don't spend it just let it grow you get all these different growth and I'm like yeah that sounds good but I'd rather have a tax deferred tax free tax for taxable taxable taxable taxable\nAnd what happens is is because people start saving all these when he's in his four one K. accounts of this distribution starts getting bigger from these IRAs folks it's now four percent when you're forced to take money out of your IRA plan it's not four percent\nI don't care what your advisors said everybody thinks that you have to take out four percent that is not true in fact\nI don't even think if I can think of a time when it's exactly four percent at all alright it starts off a little lower and he goes much much higher\nThink about this somebody had a million dollars each sixty six will seem six percent growth they got to take out a hundred and one thousand dollars on it in our town\nIt's a lot of money right when I'm when I'm I'm eighty two years old it's eighty eight if I'm if I'm Seventy eight Seventy two thousand and the thing is you know it's not four percent you're this amount starts off at a lower amount and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger\nAnd bigger gas and you have any plans for your taxes\nAre going to taxes go up so let's think about what's going on right now in the in the U.S okay we just changed taxes we just change the brackets if you're working your paycheck got a little bit of a boost depending upon what you make is how much to do she got\nSo we went from higher taxes last year to lower taxes today and the brackets got wider\nIn fact you can go all the way up to three hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars of income which is a lot of money and still only be in the twenty four percent tax bracket you were in the twenty five percent tax bracket as a married couple of filing jointly anything over approximately a hundred thousand last year\nThe\nTigers play here or as St Louis [noise]\n\n[noise] what was wrong and why are we what are you what color down in our church they don't make much safer sings more lives dot com bust your lungs down challenge today [noise]\nNow at least here\nToday at all the tigers trying to get back in a way to tell them this afternoon at the first meeting this century anyway in Memphis good afternoon\nI'm Radford I'll go Mike Mayfield running things for us here in the northwest part of the concourse had memorial stadium jacks are we ever running things for us all day long at\nOur headquarters in Jefferson City coach barrier to what the shortly now it is the\nPoint of the tigers Kelly Mike happy guy makes her happy homecoming 'til you run a hole through I had a chance to take that stand out of the parade this morning downtown ... that's always special especially when the weather is good and you know about what are your thoughts on the ballots are going to be saying that they had a rocky and block out\nAs much of it to be fought who's at the helmet today I got the the ... not on social media so I Do oh uh I don't I don't pay attention\nOtherwise they're not on social media so I Do I Do oh you know I don't I don't pay attention to\nThe Gore good for you or hobbies and they had the ah the em that's in the south end zone on the hill and then there are many on the hand so you've got the the am going to have like the rock inside the him and that over the top so that's cool I like to yeah a little bit old school a little bit of a new look to it on\nVarious not afraid to do that I mean he's not afraid to take him when he was a chance was when it comes to things like that or maybe you know the goal helping the people going for the gold homeless for years with the exception of where they go a lot of the movies the historical touch them um [noise]\nI kinda like what I saw you know I don't know maybe not maybe not in the shade not as big a printed in the shade but you know to to try and so what are we talking about home\nAnd tell us about what the action on the field you know it's one thing to to lose Alabama a decent chance everyone's going to do that this year the key of course is not to lose the Alabama game twice and that's the thing attached here's maybe not as much this year with the Crimson Tide but still you got to try to refocus unlocking that opportunity and let's\nKeep this in mind and in in very has drilled whose kids still did Gary clinical for that matter Missouri's not good enough to overlook anyway right so do you have to prepare and lock in and and try to be focused each and every game and and he's been very very pleased and talking with him\nOn Thursday honesty and interesting to me last night or he he's he's happy with with kind of preparations to pad and I just got to go out and do it right and then you've got to execute on both sides of the football [laughter]\nI Would open some standpoint can you can you recreate the vertical parents on that that's something that Missouri has not been able to do since Emmanuel all went down with a growing interest um you know you get rich on Floyd back today to you this will be the first game that he does he give you an opportunity to maybe start to feel a little bit Jay Lynn boxes and opportunities\nGotta catch it soon Johnson Johnson gotta catch is going to be able to run the football too and then from the standpoint can you stack up against the run and then can you be you'd be disciplined and particularly with your eyes a thing on the defensive side because if you watch Memphis on tape and I do not watch the entire UCF game this morning [noise]\nDo so many things free snap in terms of movements in shifts and things like that that you just really have to be focused each and every step\nOf the tigers Kelly with us on the arrive alive ... protect tailgate ... will be\nWith us momentarily Memphis does come in for Iraq or but it but as you mentioned that central Florida again that was a a match up or they're sixteen points in the second half of that game before it had

over to nor do seem\nTo the arrived in Memphis they are six one after a loss so he's been able to I think there was tension on after they had the facts and\nYou know they put a really good team last

college football\nCouple of road games in a by since Missouri's last home game I Know we're both lungs of the university that don't you spoke really eloquently at your press coverage this week about the meaning of homecoming and how it is special to you and your team and then thousands of homes\nShould be I mean it was such a great place and changed just personally speaking changed my life course history on to have an opportunity to be a student athlete here and and graduate or a couple of times and and ah Columbia and the state of Missouri there's always been so much so very to me\nIt's just a non conference game on homecoming but the Memphis Tigers as you well know from your time there and I'm sure I follow the program a bit since very dangerous opponent today\nI've got a tremendous respect not only from Memphis but for the American athletic conference and what that set conferences\nPlayed in it that's a really good football they do things right and the program we're playing da da da and the opportunity they see this as a they thrive on on a chance with like\nToday that's interesting I may just a complete this with you talking about that you were there was defensive coordinator for three years of course just to point now the head coach at Virginia Tech brought you there but they do see this as an opportunity this is a big game for a good team isn't\nIt every year they go in when I was there we went to UCLA and play we went down to two dogs for medicine blade so\nThis is not new for them [noise] um so our focus for our football team is uh you know number one we

three years and then he came back\nBefore and after that time it Memphis how did he have all the coaches the person\nWell I think anybody continues to evolve I think any coach does and I mean just you know look what look what it was an all male or what they're doing some officers standpoint who's there so I think all coaches ... the good ones that are very was always just the most important in the room and he really was and and go back there was plenty of those and um [noise]\nYou know I I think he went down there any any any prove to himself\nThat he could be more than just a position that he can be a coordinator eventually be a head coach so an opportunity in that experience of the Memphis for just one day it was very very important\nUm I like the fact that I got a chance to stay in contact with him while he was down there and we did that and then when we went to the ... and it was announced that he was coming back to the zoo or I get a chance to see 'em in the team hotel\nI get

looking forward to seeing it myself because I haven't been over there since our last game but I've seen some pictures and it's really coming together nicely and uh it's just exciting to think about that is going to be like\nNext season you already have alone that are trying to call Debs on certain seeds and set up a new building when it opens for twenty Nineteen\nAnd there's a lot of excitement or they get ... has been feel that a lot more of those calls and I have but ah it's going to you know what is going to the stadium experience I think is really really special\nAnd uh I Know there's folks that are excited about kinda see where their seats were look out on the field and [laughter] and it's a different view they're gonna be able to see the plays and hold open up I think on the fence on the line at times so up there there's folks that are excited about it\nOn a common with the Missoula alumni association the at a chance to go to Tuscaloosa last week what was the big takeaway maybe for you that that you could say OK Alabama number one of the country they do this we could do that here in Colombia to [noise]\nWell I I was really impressed by the tail getting seen what they do their ... a little different than our ... no doubt about that but it's it's like the the Ole Miss 'em the experience on steroids to a certain extent there was just so many tens and I know a lot of ... fans made their way down there we had so many comments\nFrom Alabama colleagues about how many folks were there so I just thought the campus experience but also just the way they sort of build their campus up all the billions very similar they look the same uh they're very Staley and uh it was it was an impressive campus experience and the stadium experience with school too\nThat it is a really rough gig you have on top and around a different tailgate on Saturdays and talking to people when you have those conversations are people telling you about but\nI think people are really excited about what they're seeing him as he right now with our ah our leadership structure now it doesn't certainly president joy and a chance or car ride and what they're seeing come from campus during their site is either bounce back in the role that no doubt about that ah this past weekend you know when you can draw labs are talking about a Nobel Prize winner\nPeople are really fired up about that and we talked about that are tailgate and I think is the first time we've ever said something like that had a standing ovation from the crowd that it's in our tailgate so\nPeople are really really proud of that fact I think he's also cement what they've always known about her university what a strong academic university it is sometimes get credit for that like during football season is such but um oh what a great message to be able to share with our lumps\nIn a couple of minutes of the time a comment from them as do alumni association on his homecoming Saturday may be more a question for athletics but have you gotten some extra response to demand it seemed like from people who want to want to be here today for this game\nHomecoming always special there's no doubt about that and so every year we we we were surprised that I think even though I've been to\nTwenty three years now how many folks come back when you get up in the morning to many people are lining up parade route and uh I mean people show up our campus decks the night before and it's just as a really a special tradition that a lot of campuses don't have in fact last week was Alabama's homecoming\nUm I think they're parade last you know about Fifteen minutes right on so hours ago\nThe mammoths homecoming [laughter] um I think they're parade last you know about Fifteen minutes right and so our goal probably about ... longer than that today um and so I you know it's a it's a it's a really cool tradition is one that everyone gets into around here\nIt's a big reunion in a lot of ways and so we have folks coming in from all around the country today and this is the one that begged to come back for [laughter] and uh you know with social media now you can see excitement building people texting and

out totally if you could just limited as great players but as you mentioned Henderson leads the nation and rushing\nInto today with a little over eleven hundred yards and then he averages to me that's most impressive numbers ten point three or ... ... the good guys don't you get off the average is part of the nation was seen total touchdowns leads the nation what mine rushes of forty hours or more so again the place was fiction plays tiger several of them limit those today\nOf last week he cares about thirty one time and that was a season high for and against UCF branch or a hundred and Ninety nine yards and watched\nThe flip side of that of course has reduced the strength seemed to be against the run a tigers commit to today what you're twenty fifth rank rushing even is allowing a hundred and twenty yards per game just three point four yards from Gary so what if I Want to\nCarry the ball against the tigers they are they allow a three point four for Russia Anderson averages ten point three something's got to break their we'll see what you want it is\nAnd I notice going back and watching that close to one point loss in central Florida as much as he runs as well as she runs Memphis also throws the ball I've got an Arizona State transferred quarterback pretty white and they show you a lot of different looks fans will really be maybe surprise maybe entertained whatever by a lot of information\nAs Memphis Tigers will show the formation you to death motion you to death try to get your eyes on the wrong spot and get you a direction all that kind of stuff but yeah they're definitely not one dimensional\nAs good as they are running the ball they are of course fit in the country and rushing as we talked about but they're also six of the country and passing it just seems so\nUh the indeed set the run up and throw the ball they do it very well because\nHe was six in the country are going to see their and already wide as you mentioned he is fixed individually has to be in the country in a nice little further into the numbers will end up his you know I'm I Know they're not a of our five school per se but one of the best\nGrams of the country a veto when you look up the route of non power five schools you know they've got to wait over power by each of the last three seasons they'd be UCLA last year\nThey beat all ... and two thousand Fifteen and they beat a legit university to the west and the Fifteen and sixteen seasons so they're used to playing games like this one in ... showed him was talking about that earlier this week with our media that they live for these kinds of opportunities come in and then a show something they're\nSixteen narrow sixteenth and the country with the most wins overall out of any school that we are sort of two thousand horses and so again it's a very solid for over I guess in\nThat alleged schools or the west you might be located in Lawrence who say the state yeah there's I Know you're looking to avoid that\nThis is interesting and to you know Memphis may not be confused with Alabama by many but preparing for the game you noticed that a Memphis much like Alabama strikes early and often they have really been good on opening possessions look ballgame slogans you've got to be ready you don't want to fall behind it all against anyone\nExactly it and you know what was being the favorite at home on homecoming there might be a little more pressure and in a you know you get up to a slow start if you're in Missoula you know that can make a little nervous so you do want to get off so gets dark [noise] uh in the first possession set the tone today will have to see but when you look at it a Memphis the score touchdowns up by but there are seven game opening possessions this year\nAnd a one of them didn't touched on the field are so stick that uh seven times scored on their first drive up again and then when you look\nWe'll stick out of seven times scored on their first drive up again and then when you look on the flipside Missoula stored and just to touch on it six opening session with Boeing Field goal so half the time it soccer's a scored [noise] um [noise]\nAnd then on defense what's interesting to me you know the tigers haven't had a lot of luck Morsi turnovers this year they only have a happy sticks take away so far the season two of them have been on opponent opening drives a got a fumble against Wyoming an\nInterception August Georgia so to some random things there but if you're looking to see who gets up and start a ... state suddenly these Memphis Tigers forced turnovers don't they\nYeah they do so last year the Memphis Tigers right two thirty in the nation was thirty one source turnovers so it's a big part of their their game obviously um the other numbers are down slightly this year they're thirty six coming into this game but they do have a letter takeaways is seven games in a flipside must do is\nIn the last ... or minus five and turnover margin of better care of the ball and they've been out for twenty seven to six points on turnovers in those three losses and and you can talk to those things that the reasons why\nYou don't miss you lost the game against Georgia that it was in the end and obviously lost one of the going against South Carolina so those in the windy day the ball on the air it's kind of risky will have to see how that plays out can you look at ... tigers were three you know it wasn't a huge mark and what they were lost in the turnover marketing [noise] finally\nThose are fun miscellaneous figures and go through these quickly but Missouri certainly likes the city of Memphis ... tigers in particular from that city will play significant\nRoles we expect today yeah certainly uh Jonathon Jonathon wide receiver running back to their baby and linebacker re Miller junior Memphis NATO So you know that this means a little bit more for them today I'm sure they have a lot of a family and friends who are watching are here in person to see them play against their home\nTown school and then the last number I had four years one of seven and it's already been talked about representing one hundred and Seventy come here [noise]\nThat was the first time the tigers have played Memphis for homecoming and of course last year was a good one is tigers beat Idaho sixty eight Twenty one and that was the start of a ... game win streak at a rope and repeats itself in the second half of the season this year\nSounds good and it's never too early to plan for next year as well next year so I'm coming October well\nVersus Ole

week before getting South Carolina\nI'm you know Memphis will be a very very hungry team uh they thrive on having an opportunity to go into an FCC place in play\nAnd they recruited really well and they've got some guys that\nUm you know I'll I'll take 'em right now if they want to come over and play for us they've they've got good players so uh all in all you know we will we will ... will
