can't believe it or people were making fun I'm On the other side I always got to work because you know I may just in case you know um\nHow do you uh dodge baked later this because it does seem so ridiculous but you've watched it that closely is is that out of the norm or does it look I think\nPeople are always going to engage in political parity and things like that I think one thing about this particular moment in history though is that a reality\nDirty and things like that I I think one thing about this particular moment in history though is that a reality it's kinda hard to parity I'm President Trump has been very challenging for satirists because sometimes what he does is a job\nThat is a really hard to figure out how to take it even further over the top I guess in our struggle that a little bit\nAnd we had a situation like this before where you know we have a nominee makes it to the point where the Senate committee gets together and makes the decision whether or not they're going to go forward for a vote between the full Senate and then they bring in the FBI or is this will ... will\nHeal allegations against a you know Clarence Thomas came in very late in the process I don't remember the exact timing but I think it was after he had his initial a committee hearing so there is some precedent for that happening\nAnd we don't know what's going to come of this we'll hear more on friday um say they come back and they find a bunch of stuff that that proves that that cabin all was not a person he conveyed to be any might have been involved in a in in a sexual attacks so obviously the president dense\nForest you put someone else's name out there then we get another vetting process is already gone on a while my question is is there a set timeframe is there anything in the constitution or whatever that says you have to have that seats filled by his date\nNo that's absolutely not I mean the Senate um has a role to devise a consent but the Senate has has the ability to just not act on it I Believe we saw that happened after just the schools that when the Senate kept the open um during the Garland nomination and waited to throw it until there was a new president so\nThat she could be open for a long time I would imagine that if there's a new nominee they would try to get that person confirmed or for the new Senate takes over in January but there's no guarantees\nAnd that's part of the point of this whole thing is to delayed delayed delay until after the vote on in November because that could change things ah with the way to develop goes at the end of the day no matter who the nominee is\nI guess it depends what you mean by the the point I'm you know I think that you know these allegations are out there and I think that there's some obligation on the part of the Senate to investigate them and take them seriously but you know certain people on the conservative side have raised concerns about the timing of these things were when these things can forward\nRight to delay wide why did they sit on this for so long\nYou know I I don't really know um I as I understand it only a Senator Feinstein was aware of these allegations until very late in the process and\nShirt her story has been a that Dr Ford didn't want to come forward and she was trying to respect her confidentiality until someone leak this allegation um we don't really know what happened behind the scenes and who had access to it and put it out there but it certainly seems plausible to me that um\nYou know fairly late in the process someone on the Democratic side you know I was aware of the allegations have decided to get him to the press but which they just record for us to know\nAnd other perplexing part of this is she structure for takes this story two a\nDay in science and confide in her\nGels or what's going on or wants to stay anonymous not sure what she's going to do about this it gets leaked somehow the paper gets story Dr forge and just turned

I think this leads from CBC sons from country day the lack of the military and guns and the blue it's a quilt [laughter] I really should quilts\nAnd on and do you guys are awful mother has filed a federal lawsuit after her son did not make the varsity soccer team at all or do I deal when you made the team but you had to make the team\nBut he did make the team before and it's interesting and here's why it gets interesting to play devil's advocate here so the ... say that once you have played varsity for any sport\nThat means your lockdown unless you play grandfathers were that school I had that are in fact there and you can't you yeah you have to stay at that school this kitten left la due to let's say X Y Z school he would still not be allowed he would be eligible\nTo play soccer on the varsity level they have rules like that there are high sleep for the boys but not for the girls so that's where this mom\nIs coming and I see at first glance you read this and you think well who did get the kid didn't make it didn't make it to some McDonalds hot cup of coffee story but what if that's what you're relying on to try to get to college and maybe you'll play soccer in college at a lower level and Neal\nYou know the I Can't take that away or confused he was on a varsity team in another school and he was outlive do on the varsity team he went back to try out again for this year right and they said that he was\nIn the in the wheel house but short of having the skill set that he needed in order I'm paraphrasing in order to be on the team cause some better players showed up for it and now he can't go somewhere else and play soccer\nCan you play JV no they said\nNo but ... as it turns out a now upon further investigation nephew will they say that you um that that there's nothing that's written that says that you can't play day be they just don't let you go back and then that part I don't understand but I Would like to know what our listeners think\nAbout this if you've heard about the story the judge is supposed to rule on that sometime today so hopefully I'm\nGoing to spend a week on it at least yeah uh-huh yeah I mean I you know I don't know how I feel about that I I don't\nUnderstand what you make the varsity team how you get to stay on the varsity team you could well I made the team I've just got a phone it in now and you've got kids that are desperately trying to to make the varsity team at work really hard at it and deserve a shot and don't get one because you're just coasting that I think that is really a stupid real\nAnd there were seven juniors cut from the varsity team and so he wasn't the only one and the coaches he was quote on the bubble but now this you know the coach has to go to court and the school district has to go to court\nAnd they won't let them play on the GB team because they say that that's reserved for freshman and sophomore Rachel home their skills right away presumably later play on the so you just don't get to play soccer yeah that's where it's unless you're joined some elite team that's not tied to a school\nRight and you could do like an independent team you know like Gallagher or want\nTo know what I heard yeah you got to give you scholarships if you plan on elite team that's not tied to a school\nThat I don't know but but it is kind of funny that this kid wouldn't be allowed to go try out for another school and playing I mean I get I I understand that because if you open that door then you've got kids moving around\nYou know to and from different private schools from public schools to get tuition that not that that that that that died and it gets really stinky yeah but right now he's\nNot playing soccer so if it goes through the other school he is a new soccer player 'cause right now is not on a team he's not leaving the soccer team to go play soccer somewhere else\nNot on a team he's not leaving the soccer team to go play soccer somewhere else the teams that we don't watch it we should be able to go where he wants huh I think it's totally sending the wrong message to the kid and the mom might be on something so she suing to get back on the team or does she\nWant money\nUh so far suing to get him back on the team as far as we now but it hasn't you know gone to the entire\nWell I'd like I'd love to see if we get back on the team but I Wonder what his experience is going to be like if it to court mandate saying oh you're a ... year mommy ... interesting because\nThey filed the suit under age and sex discrimination right and the kid they did not released his name
