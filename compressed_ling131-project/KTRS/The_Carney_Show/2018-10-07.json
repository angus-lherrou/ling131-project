K. tiara each and every week we talk about retirement we talk about retirement in a way that makes sense we talk about retirement many things you never thought about because Kevin specializes in overtime if we cannot say that enough\nBecause taxes and investing is different in retirement\nPack health insurance is different in retirement as well and so who was talking to you about is your\nFinancial guy telling you oh boy you need to talk to a tax guy is your account and saying hey I only worried about last year's taxes\nKevin Lloyd combines at all to help you out with a plan to take your money out as well as everything else so\nUh he is next act seminar is a November ... this will fill up this will be the last\nRave reviews by people who go and spend an hour or more with Kevin you will not try and sell you a timeshare condo at the end it's just one hour of great information November eleventh at his office when retirement happens dot com three one for six for one ten ten you can call and leave a message we need a head count\nA so called ahead reservist spot three one for six for one tent and or the website when retirement happens a dot com um\nUN ... well you know we were talking about what you just mentioned you said talking about the time when we're not going to try to sell your time share in fact we know we're not going to do that nor am I going to let you use my because my kids want to write yet okay by kids like to do that and you know remember on Thursday when I call when you called me and we we talked on the show and\nWe talked about I said you know I bring my daughter to school every single morning and I always\nSay tell me a joke because she just loves telling jokes and so she told me that joke she said hey what's the difference between a well dressed man in a suit on a bicycle\nVersus I'm with someone who is not well dressed man on a union cycle and I'm like yeah it's one less a wheel I I I don't I don't I don't know I Do and she goes attire\nTired and I looked at her I said you get that joke and she's like yeah dad because the tire can be the bicycle tire or dress so tired as I got it so I can sometimes she tells me jokes and she doesn't understand the punch laid a genius she is she is a great but the reason why I said that again\nIs some times the the difference okay isn't as noticeable mhm right I mean think about this\nHave you ever worked with somebody and you're like you know what this is my friend is a good person\nBut they're probably not do and what they need to do for me or this is my doctor then I have to be doing what they should be doing for me that I could probably go somewhere else but I'm not going to because yeah I'm just comfortable the way I Am I Will\nLook I guilty as charged I Will do things and I think we all do things why do we do things because it's easier to do it then to hear the wrath of not doing it\nRight it's easier you know what it's just I've known the guy for a hundred years we're really not friends anymore but it's his wife and my ... let me just fine I'll just put up with it\nIf I just grin and bear it I'll put up with it it's fine\nI just grin and bear it I'll put up with it is fine\nRight or or or my my financial called financial advisor um\nWe do this thing once a month where a bunch of us old guys from from ah from high school we all get together and we play golf together and and you know it would be very awkward to not have ... one of my\nGuys are in third grade we do this thing once a month he's from my Bible study he's from my church he is at my kids' school he's my coach he's my kids coach there was some sort of\nConnection here and it's just difficult to break that relationship folks if they're a friend they're going to like you no matter what if you are with them or not with them but I mean you think about this um\nI think it would be difficult for me to tell\nMy friends or someone I've been with a really long time that they're not doing a good job right like if I'm not satisfied I'm not talking about like rates of return okay because that's pretty easy but you know I'm not satisfied because I'm not getting the information I deserve because every time I go in for my review\nWe talk about my account a little bit but more or less we're just talking about the old days where I kind of catching up or asking about the family you know and I'm not seen any of that stuff not important but we are talking about the plan right\nFive seconds is on the investments we're we never once talked about the plan anything about it and say let's say you come into my workshop and you learn all this stuff about taxes so can you learn how to how to pull your money out you're not paying taxes and your your your your your eyes get opens right okay\nAnd ... now you would you want to come into the office and let's see we go through the whole plan and everything looks good and you want to make a change\nIt's hard to break that relationship right because we've been with them so long as you're going to be like you you're cheating on your yeah you feel like you feel like you're cheating on your guy and and now you're here at this point and you're like you know I got a call right and I always say\nIf it was me I Would want that phone call right why because I Want to find out what I did wrong what did I Do that didn't that made you go somewhere else and and they always say well what do I say I say\nNow you're working with somebody who specializes in retirement right okay now I Know that sounds pretty basic but that's real it's the real thing and so when you call 'em up and you tell them that they said well what do you mean special what do you think I Do I specialize in retirement start getting defensive well they're showing me these tax strategies right\nI can do that so then you stay there right okay because I can do that because I hear this a lot I can do that but if you can why haven't you been doing a that's a question that is a question of folks if you're stuck\nIn this situation and\nYou see something that is better than we're you war why aren't you change and right so I was asking my office about this okay then says it really happened very much in my office but I asked this question in my office I said\nGuys why don't people to make changes when they know they're not getting the information that they deserve it\nAnd I thought about it and I was like you know what I Do that myself you know we're all guilty of it I'm guilty of that too\nWhen I go see my general practitioner okay I remember why I don't want to be there anymore\nBecause he makes me wait in his waiting room for about thirty minutes past my appointment and then I sit in my office in the uh the patient room\nFor another forty five minutes and then he finally gets in and I'm like I'm a little mad you know like how do you how dare you violate my time like that and I would understand if it happened one time that happened but it happens every single time\nAnd then when I talk to him on fight afterwards threat and like you know what I'm not changing the good guy he he seems like he cares about me I [laughter]\nI Need just dawned on me the other day when I spoke with my office they said I Am doing the exact same thing that I think that people shouldn't do right and I said I'm going to find me a new doctor and in fact I'm going to find me a new doctor why am I going to find a new doctor because my doctors too busy\nMy doctor sees every single person from past pediatrician too about death right he doesn't specialize in nothing he said general practitioner he's a good guy but he never caught my issue\nI had to go through surgery I had to go through not breathing for a long period of time or a point where I thought I was going to die\nAnd I'm Still with this guy right now that I'm Talking about this I Need a nutritionist they do an allergy tests now I'm breathing because I'm not eating that garbage that I was eating before that was killing me right right\nSo I'm victim of that too and I said this just doesn't make sense why would I stay in this type of relationship because he's a good guy right he's a nice guy but you know what I think he's violated my trust too many times that I've found where I should move somewhere somewhere else I should be\nThe other thing too is a nurse you write a nurse or you're in a better relationship with a girl a doctor or barber you know your dry cleaner your your uh your financial guy as a nurse you know what I got to\nA man he knows all my account numbers I got to find my account numbers I got to do that's right I don't know how many times people say oh I hate my bank quite well could they do this and that is terrible watch uh well I got my direct deposit and I got to go move this is just a pain in the neck I'll just put up with that\nYou're you're right absolutely right I'm done right All right soon as anytime anybody comes to my office asked me if I found a new doctor or not because\nI should have found a new doctor a long long time ago in fact if I Would have found a new doctor and then one that I'm working with actually today is my nutritionist I'd still have Eighteen Inches of my colon yeah I'd have been fine yeah the whole law and\n... and actually that's the other moral to the story when you actually do make the change when you stop the train back it up and go in a different direction not only will you be happier when you've made this change but you realize boy that really wasn't that hard to to to begin with to make\nBut we think his job is just to manage money but that's not a fiduciary okay so I started asking more questions now I Know your husband had passed away when are you going to take Social Security\nAnd it has nothing to do with health insurance I Know but I'm just ask ... 'cause that's what we do we ask questions right\nI don't think it's their job to ask me questions to figure out how to do stuff I think it was my job to ask the questions and show them how to do all bets are off and mass question I'm not saying don't ask questions I'm just seeing\nAs an advisor it's my job to make sure you're doing everything you need to do that is in terms of financial planning and it goes beyond\nInvestments so as you say about the Social Security questions so on the Social Security questions because well I went down to the office\nAnd I actually got some good advice down there they said for me to get at sixty\nBut they said if I wait till sixty seven that might be the best time for the widow's benefits or because I won't I won't give up anything because if you take a sixty you do give up something at full retirement no matter what whatever your full retirement age is in case it was sixty seven they said just go take a there are so\nHold on why did you go to Social Security to figure that out\nI mean your advisor should know these things and you should tell you the stuffing facts before we invest your money he should have already giving you all these answers\nBut what happens is as we get we get comfortable in relationships one because my husband used them right to their friends are there are a family member or we've used them a long time or my dad used them folks who cares right\nWho cares we want to make sure that we do the best thing for us in fact\nWhile I was talking to her I jumped on line fixed if you looked at a few things and I said you're paying eight hundred and something dollars a month for you and your kids\nHere's a plan that I think might work for you I don't know until I get all your information so I Need you to come in right here's a plan\nI think it shows here I can get your tax credit of a thousand dollars a month [laughter] I Know you have to pay an eight hundred okay but you got a high deductible plan to if you pay this and have no premium\nOr you're going to have a high deductible is like fourteen thousand dollars for game that's pretty big for a family doctor bowl yeah so I said if you're willing to pay and I don't remember what it was thirty or forty dollars a month\nWe could lower it down to like\nIt was like a four thousand dollar deductible while which is still a heck of a lot less than a hundred dollars a month ... hundred dollars to save ten thousand years and and so she she had a business and everything to in some businesses are different than individuals 'cause we get to kind of hide things before they show up to the front page of our tax return\nTo expense is not really hide 'em but through the fence as we get to do this so\nHere's this lady not knowing if anybody can help her for the last four years she's been paying for health insurance out of her pocket we should have because I asked her what her income was all the while\nShe could have been getting these subsidies the whole time so let's go back to last for years and the eight hundred dollars a month that we were paying that's roughly ten grand a year it's forty thousand dollars\nShe paid forty thousand dollars in health care premiums when she should have been getting one hundred percent subsidies but I like my financial guy so I don't like him that much it costs me forty thousand dollars my my guy costs me Eighteen Inches in my colon right I'm Still with the remember I'm done\nHow much of this do you think Kevin Lloyd\nIs a false sense of security because one hypothetically speaking\nThis woman as of great financial planner she doesn't do that and now she doesn't know that that he doesn't know about the health care so she she doesn't blame him for\nFor me being charge forty thousand dollars and you know what he's doing really good but is he the stock market's doing good how hard is it for everyone investments to be going up and so all these people are getting credit for something that a monkey could do\nYou are absolutely correct we get complacent when the market is way up\nBecause our guys doing a good job because he's getting he's getting six percent he's getting ten percent twenty percent rate of return but he's doing a great job no the market's up I mean your account should be up um or I should be but what else what kind of value is he actually providing what does he do enforce the because\nA lot of these guys actually for their fee they form it out to some other company let them manage and they all they do with me with you a couple of times a year if they do that\nSo not only did did this individual pay forty thousand as they shouldn't have paid for [noise]\nWhat about all these other tax benefits that they could have gotten his will on top of all of this [noise]\nYou know another thing is is um\nThis is probably pretty important [noise]\nOkay folks when we lose some body\nDo we have enough time to this town did is we will hold that thought that what

think you should pay attention you know if your house did not sell during this season this most recent season\nThere were three problems with her right one might have been location\nTo might've been condition and three price now\nLocation and condition can be fixed with price but location in condition can't fix overpriced okay regardless\nOf how nice it is regardless of what you think you know we get become so emotionally attached to our homes that are [noise]\nThoughts like our kids we get a little bit skewed in our opinion of who they are what they can do and what they've done you know it's kind of like they're never my kid well sometimes it is well it's never my house well some time it is so our first stories about um\n[noise] it's about a large house in South county it's a two story\nFour bedroom two and a half bath luxury bat living room dining room family room kitchen a deck overlooking a great view of a private\nPrivate trees is that the right way to say there's nobody to live in ...\nLife private trees is that the right way to say and there's nobody living behind the house how about I reduced this down to a level that I can understand I Know I Know you're like me to talk up [laughter] but uh we\nHave to live with what we have and I don't have much except when it comes to real estate rest a life ... you know [noise] so anyway\nIt's in great condition okay it's in great condition and it's been on the market a hundred and forty four days a hundred and forty four days and actually it's one of the listeners or the radio show oh how unusual actually it's not unusual at all [noise] and if I haven't centered\nEnough um thank you to the listeners who call me and say they want my expertise or be they want my expertise and opinions [laughter] I guess\nThey're all the same or they don't really know anyway my I Am my opinion and you hear my opinion every week so [noise]\nIt hadn't sold than a hundred and forty four days a two story home four bedrooms two and a half bad as great a great view walked out basement unfinished but walked out basement maintenance free\nLandscaping beautiful hardwood floors in the kitchen and in the family room carpeting\nAnd the living room and the dining room okay All right All right so um\nIt's a bit and the three car garage by the way All right so [noise] um when they called me I said an appointment and I think they called we talked on Monday and I went and saw him on Tuesday yeah I'm fast these days very very fast except when it comes to ah\nGetting cure for cancer ooh did I say that Oh yes I Am beating it I anyway ... let's not get me distracted let's keep focused as long as we're focused on real estate we might learn something\nSo they she called me and the she misses [noise] and I went over to see the Mr and Mrs and um and I asked\nThem how many people had been to the home and uh I'm there hadn't been many okay and I asked um had there been any open houses and a ... been a ton of them maybe ten of them but there hasn't been any in the last month and a half\nAnd the lifting a ninja and adjust approached him and said uh they needed to drop the price thirty thousand dollars and all of the sudden the listing agents and well you know the carpeting is a problem and and a couple of other things and the southerners opinion was why didn't you bring this up months ago\nAnd the center was really confused because they really didn't know why they're property hadn't solved and they didn't get any feedback about what\nPotential buyers had thought of it when they came through it\nAnd they had no idea but blah blah blah blah and ... and and so you're getting the picture here you're getting the picture that the agent had listed the property\nAnd um for the most part and disappeared okay so the first thing I asked them if they were aware of how many agents that looked at the property or how many views had been a by um\nPeople ... I was a tough word to come up with how many eight ... how many people had viewed it and said that they liked it how many\nAuto emails was being sent out what ... what what we're ... numbers in and again you know ... it was not the state of the yard that a lot of people think it it isn't even close to matching the MLS by the way by All right so there so you know when I say I'll let you view properties through the MLS hair or let's do it again\nOf what how many are left okay a three of them are left you want to use the MLS to look at property the one that's one hundred percent accurate status has to be changed\nWithin twenty four hours of status change and you can't get access to it except through me\nOkay three of you can have access to it there's only three left three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven and nine six nine five eight seven seven other reason I just brought up the MLS when we're talking about the sale of this property is because the MLS allows agents they have a plethora of data\nAbout what's going on what activities going on with this property so they said they've never seen any of that information and she had never discussed any of that information and they never gotten any feedback\nI said well\nI I said when I knew when I Do want to the sea and many things um\nI go over with a little bit of information but I don't go over with much because I don't want to tainted view I Want to go in and evaluate the house in the condition it is for what I see that conditioned to be and what could be changed about the condition if anything\nAnd I just don't want my opinions skewered and of course when I go to um people say all the time hey hey hey what's\nIt worth it and I go I don't know I'll tell you later because the first time I say would I think without doing my homework my opinion stinks and they never ... they\nI'm putting it in the MLS I said they didn't do any man that's or they didn't buy any list of people that were most likely to be able to wanted to move into this neighborhood and could afford this sign a house you know send them a specialized flyer didn't do any of that stuff I Do that all the time [laughter]\nYou know you got to throw all animals out there and see which part of it sticks that's right I've been in fact I've been selling a home in Newtown driving me crazy and a good way but driving me crazy [noise] it's the most beautiful home I've ever walked into\nBut we can't get it sold than we've tried every imaginable farmer marketing I mean flyers open houses balloons aging domed house agent open house luncheons I'm a male outs oh my gosh ...\nHuman resources department and uh and and we have slowly but steadily dropped the price because what all the owner and I haven't been able to realize is it's not for lack of marketing or exposure that the houses and selling unfortunately for the neighborhood\nUm\nPeople don't want to pay that much money for that for a house to house my passion west county it'd be worth eight hundred thousand ... anyway\nBack to this when these people had none of that information then I was telling you this summer I'm Wainwright had none of it they had no clue they had twenty five days left on their listing and she came over and say well we got to do with thirty thousand dollar deduction and we gotta we gotta I'm a\nChange the carpeting while I went to the house the carpeting is fine I mean it doesn't even look blocked on\nPittsburgh burn it looks really good and it's in the living room in the dining room All right if we wanted to change that out the hardwood floors that's one thing\nIf we want to change out the hardware that's another I told them they needed to power wash the back of the house but what they really needed was marketing and what they also needed was response from the realtor to the marketing so that they could make good decisions about the sale of their home\nAt least that's how I see it that's how I like working with people I I told you I don't like spending money boat um marketing somebody's house I like spending money because they need to because I Need to get the house under contract\nAnd I need do use every tool available to get that house under contract and if this was new news to view out there then then Louis enough and if you got your property listed listen up because because you need to be talking to your realtor\nSo I Want to buy them going back I'm doing the final evaluation I'm going back out I'm selling sending one of them ladies that works for me she's an interior decorator she's going to go through the property with the um the missus\nAnd get an evaluation of what she thinks that the hardware and such\nAnd I told her to to finally called the real terrorists just fed up with that kind of color real turn said they'd like to be released from their listing well the real jerk and either say yes or let them do the last Twenty one days listing and then um and then we're going to sell it\nAnd I'll keep you abreast of how itself in fact I'm going to keep you abreast of how it uh it's marketed in that house I was talking about a week and writes the same way you see real estate is not rocket science real estate is math and first and foremost\nIt's math it's a value waiting in the piece of property so that you can determine its correct value or write\nIronically on this house when they were listing at um the homeowners said just she thought it was worth in the high three eighties and then lifting age it listed at four hundred and Seventy four thousand that listing agent listed this house at least fifty to Seventy five thousand dollars\nOver probably Seventy five thousand which is why I had was salt because when their house was compared to other homes are available for four hundred and Seventy four thousand dollars guess what they lost that evaluation other homes that were truly worth the money had\nThat much more to offer so they were set up the house all the people that went through it\nWent through other homes and said while for our money and we're getting a lot more on this other house which is a shame which is what and that's the situation and I'm helping people sell their home I have to tell them that I have to tell them the good news the bad news ... the ugly news and the great news\nBecause I'm the employer is sellers the employee I'm Sorry I'm In the employee the sellers the employer [noise]\nSo we'll put the property up at the beginning in November\nWe're already making the marketing plan we've got a decorator out there to do an evaluation you know women's eyes look better at a\nWell gay men are good at it but uh most men are not good at ... decorating right All right by the way those you're new to the program you're listening to this week in

[laughter] All right so we're not too politically correct ... does have you heard me forever and here's why I say that they've done over a million dollars with the surgery on me and I bet I've paid a total of Fifteen hundred dollars everything I have needed\nHas been done which is why I'm Alive they've kept me alive and they continue to do it and I get everything that I Need without anybody asking someone's permission\nThat's what's available to you every veteran out there\nThis is also a nonpaying job for me I'm doing it because I'm a veteran and I want other veterans to be aware of what's available we aren't that's what Mr rep co the director of the medical group says\nWe want people to know what they've earned yeah and there is no budget and now of course there's the budget but there isn't any budget when you are on healthy and you need care\nThey don't go to the books and see if there's any money left they take care of you so without further ado I have three gentleman in the studio and not use that term loosely but\nI'm Still trying to be nice home I think I'm doing pretty good why don't we start with you right over their doctor\nCarsick boost gosh dang I practiced mood pass a me close close enough\nArea did did did I ruin it any worse than a lot of other people do\nNo not a whole lot um it's ... with US Army\nCar take much to Sammy Sosa Sarah what do you do at the VA\nTerry I'm an anesthesiologist and da da da da dun and wake up at the end of the surgery\nWalks in and and put something in my arm and says I'm this one's going to get you ready and then we'll be back to do something else in the meantime I just go to sleep right absolutely okay getting I wake up\nAll the ... obviously I'm Still here I wake up [noise] so what kind of training did you have to do to become an anesthesiologist\nSuffer ... uh we all go to medical school will be able to become\nMedical doctors and then once that training is done this a highly specialized training yes that spans for years for it to five years depending\nJustin ... doing the drugs and you do\nSo um it's four years of anesthesia residency and if you choose to do a fellowship where are you specialize in one area of anesthesiology um so I chose cardiac anesthesiology\nYou know it's a hard business the hard but you can do it any kind of business you can take care of absolutely our second guest Dr Gary Miller you are ... surgeon correct\nAnd a and actually we're going to start I'm going to be meeting with them Wednesday to do more conversations about benefits it's huge\nBut what I did learn is they have a line you can call\nThat can get you the answers you need some one of the things we do in this program is after you put on hold after they're our call\nThey get your name and number and it's set to sent to the appropriate department for instance in your case I Would assume it will be benefits and they will be calling you have you gotten your problem solve or is it just difficult sometimes\nFor me I'm a hundred percent disabled veterans so it doesn't make a difference but what ends up happening as the doctors operate on these guys these guys are then not able to do anything because they're recovering from the surgery\nAnd in most cases it will take a year before they ever see the money that they should have been paid for a while they were recovering from surgery then by that time to be honest with you there already far enough in debt because they have no money coming in when they were unable to work because well the Veterans Administration didn't say that during the year after it happened\nWell I can say this to you know the the new BA has dramatically improved their timing\nYeah there is planning major improvements\nOver ... ... what I had to do it when I had\nAn injury and we're trying to get workman's comp I was back to work before the workman's comp claim was ever even I'm Judy ... so I I don't know that it's any different in the private sector than it is in the Veterans Administration actually it's\nIt's it's a lot different um you know I just participated in this first choice program where they had to send me outside of the aid that have\nBeen I had that on a couple of times I liked it\nI I edit done two years ago and after I had the surgery done the doctors that they that did the work outside your behavior like well we supply with anything you gotta do to get back so I had to go back up and be able to do the surgery to get the stuff I needed to take care of the well I'm going to get my medication\nDuring the trial the others have another woman on let me\nGet an answer your first question in my experience has been when I've had surgeries that um I go to them they do the operation and whatever they did for an operation they were responsible for

needs to send me a ... I think they're called consultations with our ... is that what it is they send me over to you guys and then you guys make a decision about\nWhere to proceed from there I guess you use MRI's\nYes we review about twenty twenty five ... ... per day while I'm and I'm and look at the radiology ... anyways\nCat do you do cat scans nurses that for some other kind of injury\nAt times whatever's available in the system we used to adjudicate how severe the problem is and and the acuity would which it must be seen or if it can be addressed non without a a an actual appointed if he can be addressed or just by communicating electronically with the primary provider will do that\nOkay so so in other words I get enrolled\nOr go to my primary explained my problems\nAnd if it is my example is my ... near my shoulder it goes to your department\nAnd then you decide what the plan of action would be right yes ... you don't you consult with other people but you make that decision correct yes so okay so you say I Need a new neat how do you consult with the anesthesiologist\nSo let me answer that question right so once the patient is scheduled for surgery mhm they put in the ... was called an anesthesia pretty up evaluation consul\nAnd so a team of um my department looks at a uh the patient's history and the ... um the other medical problems that they have\nAnd we called them for an appointment with Dave and if we feel that we need to meet with them personally and talk to them\nAnd we talk to them or get to know more about the medical problems come up with a plan and discuss the plan with them\nWhat kind of anesthesia they've they will have what are the options that we have for the kind of procedure though for the total knee joint we can do a spinal static we can do a generally anesthesia we can do it or blood and we explained to them\nThe whole spectrum of what we can do including post operative pain control\nUm and um then\nThey are scheduled for a surgery at a certain day\nSo now you have fellows and you have people from St Louis you in Washington you there in their residency or produce resin\nSt Louis you in Washington you there in their residency or post residents here fellowship whatever all those things are but they're not able to go out on their own and be a doctor so they might be in that conflict but you review it all don't you yes\nAnd if there is an issue that they're not sure of you get involved immediately\nDoes you we'll look at all the uh medical problems in us for example there is a\nUm a doubt that a patient has a heart problem that does not address before we send the cardiologist we coordinate the concept of with a cardiologist or that they have\nChronic breathing issues we coordinate their care but the problem with knowledge as we get a call from them and then we wait for\nThe reply from that and when we get the clearance from the cardiologist or the ... just you know at least I Know it's\nFunny as a I guess when they were going to operate on my neck they had me take some sort of a they had me get on a\nTrack and run on whatever those machines are stressed is yeah stress that that's right and you know I go to the gym every day every day and I got on that stupid thing and I thought I was going to faint numb thinking Jerry what's wrong with you you do this exercise every day but\nIt gets junior does I mean it just it stresses you out\nSo we like to see because surgery is a strength by so mhm so we want to see how you handle the stress and if your heart is able to take that stress hum order the anything that can be fixed before because as you know if it's done an emergency surgery\nAnd does an elective surgery we need to make sure that a patient is ready in all aspects", "show_name": "The Carney Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "07"}
