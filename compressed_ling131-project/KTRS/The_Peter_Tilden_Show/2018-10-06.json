thousand dollars or more now when I say within five years of retirement I mean you\nOr your spouse you and your\nHand or your spouse either one of your within five years call Kevin what\nIts best to start early but even if you are retired there are lots of things chemical I can help you do um and because we know the taxes and investing is different in retirement and Kevin specializes in retirement to run for\nSix for one ten ten or the website when retirement happens dot com okay so we've been going in the last couple of weeks we've been telling a story isn't an hypothetical stories about things people do wrong\nPeople who come into your office than you see them retire incorrectly you have another story for us\nThe retiring correctly or they're doing things incorrectly before they retire and they have financial people it's just unfortunately the financial people they don't understand retirements but or they just don't understand different things about pre retirees as well also but hypothetically had someone come into my office who was self employed\nAnd they made about fifty five grand as self employed person and a total income after ... like like thirty thousand dollars and so I was talking to this person is and you know you're a you're fifty nine years old you're still work and you're still said you want to work for about three to four more years\nOr what have you done for health insurance so far and so we've talked a lot about health insurance I just think it's important that we don't go without health insurance because it could just destroy your portfolio right\nAnd she said well you know I Do have insurance that's good she goes but I'm paying eight hundred and fifty dollars a month for it\nYeah that seems pretty high for insurance but the good thing you do she was yeah it has a high deductible plan as well to all the good thing is you got insurance case something happens now did you go on the marketplace to buy this insurance she goes no I've had this thing for years it just keeps getting more and more expensive I said\nWhen's the last thing you met with like a health broker to try to look and see if you get better premiums she goes well it's been several years and I don't think the guys in the ... business anymore\nAnd I said well what about your what about your guy over there at that one friend that you're working with right now your your financial guy right what's he saying about health insurance and they just pay the premiums there's nothing I can do about it I said okay\nI said well I'm Glad you came into my office hypothetically right [laughter] but what if I could show you that if you make just a few changes that you could get subsidized ... and then when I see subsidized I think people get confused about that\nAnd this is why we knew this it's called a tax credit it's a health care tax credit for it so being somebody that works with taxes and trying to help people say money in taxes it the healthcare tax credit threat so I said if you were to apply on the on the uh the marketplace or health care dot Gov\nInstead of you know the way you did it\nYou would actually get a healthcare credit and the credit would almost wash out your entire cost in fact you know if your income was a little higher because you sold stock and he said he sold stock um\nWhich is the maximum for a single person she's single is forty eight thousand two hundred and forty dollars a married couple at sixty four thousand nine hundred and sixty to your one dollar over you don't get these credits I said if you're at forty thousand two hundred and forty dollars which is the maximum\nYou can get the exact same policy you got what that sixty eight hundred dollar high deductible did you go and your premiums like a hundred and sixty nine dollars a month to get the subject but see your incomes thirty\nAnd if you do it this way you would actually get a health credit\nOf eight hundred and thirty nine dollars a month and so for this premium you would you would have to pay a premium unfortunately but I think you can swing and three dollars and thirty and you saw the same deductible right\nNow if I didn't didn't you say she was making fifty five thousand she was making fifty five grand but see she's self employed right so you got to write offs on your schedule C. corporation you got to write offs\nAnd they don't count any of that they actually count which shows up on the front page or macho guy okay so the march I showing thirty\nI said if we can figure out a way to get this down even lower maybe twenty thousand dollars\nYour premium will be three dollars and eighty four cents would actually go fifty four cents a month unfortunately but you're young people goes down to Eighteen hundred thousand a hundred and fifty dollars to be exact\nSo what do you want to do you know and I'm I'm thinking about what I mean yeah right and then to be a big fat how are you still so we're having this conversation I didn't really tell or any of that stuff but were who you but I've looked at it afterwards but I did say\nOr she did say she goes but you charge fees right to me and she has a chance I suggested in and uh she goes is it really is he going to be worth it is you're going to be vale you remember that a hundred and something dark premium is you're paying every what if you didn't have to pay their premium or went down a little you know went down to very low amount\nAnd here's my feet most likely based on what you're saying there was a huge difference in my feet and when you're just saved on your health insurance stuff do you think there's value there oh yeah of course right not to mention the tax savings investment right all of this other stuff that we do I'm not here to manage your money\nI'm here to manage your overall life plan your investment person shouldn't be here to manage your money\nAnd they should be there to manager life plan OK explain that because I thought that's why these people were here where to manage my money that's right 'cause that's all we think about is retirement is our money we think about investments and we think about investment people only doing investments and that's what Ninety seven percent of these people out there do or they're selling some sort of product\nAnd all of us are doing this down but see if they're not doing tax plan you can handle financial plan you cannot have a financial plan if you're not planning for taxes and we're not talking about harvesting losses your minuses and applause is at the end of the year that's not tax plane right you're harvesting but you're not really doing any foreign looking proactive tax plane\nThat's what we need to do we have to do this forward looking pro active tax planning but we have to look at the overall life planning as well too so the investments are taxes the insurance or risk management as well to the state planning making sure that we have the proper amount of income lasting and that's why I think people get a piece\nAnd when you donate nominate a class by entering the school's name and the teacher's name and the comments section then you're eligible for when all

I don't know if you have that in all ... now so that was a that was\nOur latest creation you know when we opened our third location I said gosh I just want to do healthy smoothies so everything you cook and you make in your chef\nEverything it said flavors is is what is it is a perfectly balanced what what do we got\nSo it just goes back to what\nHow I started I I my background is in fitness so just going through I can tell that the only tell that ten years of personal training and and helping people\nEat a certain way and then seeing all the diet fads that are out there and then you know people have different dietary needs and restrictions and when we created the product like I wanted people to have a food one that would get them results\nTo that would taste delicious because if it doesn't taste good you're not\nGoing to be consistent with it and I know that the number one way to success with anything but mostly when a diet and exercise is consistency so it's not necessarily what type of what kind but it's being consistent so I wanted consistency with my our shoppers so um our products are designed with whole foods so that that's\nThat's first and foremost like eating whole foods is just completely different than eating processed foods they break down slower to have less calories they're full of more nutrients they make you feel more satisfied so that's kind of like the base and then we balance our meals typically with a protein starch and a vegetable\nNow we do offer low carb stuff\nAs well and we'll just double serving the vegetables okay you know but down to like all of our sauces and stocks we make all of that stuff and how to control sugar because and so that is where things creeping sauces address yeah a lot a lot of places you go eat that advertise healthy nowadays I says consumers\nDon't know what to look for so we just believe the marketing behind the product we don't see the transparency of how it's prepared and what is going into the food\nSo when we created the product I go I Want to tell the customers exactly what's in the products so they know and we you know\nBuilt sauces and socks and everything so they would be able to say so our our product is based off a whole food approach okay I Love\nThat and maybe you can answer this question for me\nIs a bad thing and really does anybody know what ... knows 'cause I Know it has to do with ... everybody knows what it is I bet it generally and the because the other day my fiance a wedding in her mom was like I think I'm going to start on a gluten free diet um like juvenile were glued to that ah yeah and I'm like I don't really know that it\nWhat's the story behind it yeah that is so funny um I watched I was like a talk show clips from like Jimmy Fallon ... he interviewed like people in the park I asked him what was it a Derek all got like a car and someone was like\nI have no idea [laughter] I don't know glued is actually a protein that's found in a wheat barley and rye\nOh yeah and it's a it's really bad for people who have silly acts because it gives them issues what so some people have gluten intolerance is oh so they feel better if they stay away from good and they can get information and stuff like that it's not like a weight loss crash\nSo gluten is found in a lot of processed foods okay read so it has to die away for when you stay away from those foods I like it was kind of a fad for a while it's just going gluten free yeah you know like there's like\nLooting free and I like I eat tons of gluten does not affect me whatsoever I eat\nAnything or do I like offering gluten free options on our menu won because so many people are stuck on it but there are a lot of people who do need to eat that way but I think there's a lot of good whole food products that do contain gluten like whole wheat pasta so how many meals a day do you eat\nOkay so I'm very far along in my my journey with my eating in my nutrition has definitely changed over time like you I'm sure you've heard eat three small meals a day and ... you know that that's great it doesn't always work for me sometimes I Need more sometimes I don't eat as much I listen to my body I eat frequently\nI eat some days I just eat snacks often I mean is really what I'm doing for the day but it was the question is how often do I eat frequently\nThe muscles around ... working or not I don't like this one um yeah there's the science\nBehind that's a trainer and me but I Know when I got into fitness and to answer your question [laughter] ah I realized oh my God if I Want to change my physique I have to change the way I eat and\nWas a wakeup call because I don't know anything about food you know and then I realized wow like this takes a lot of effort to think about it every meal all the time and what is any so then I had to learn how to look and it was like\nAll the time and what is in it so that had to learn how to look and it was like it was a journey to to learn those things and then I realized what I could do with my body and then what I could do with my clients body with food I mean your arms are fantastic she needed just post those on so I mean you might\nBe the perfect woman likes to cook you look fabulous you've got your own business you're a mom\nHow do you balance all this it's hard it is yeah it's hard because with a business like sit flavors with three locations you can't be at home you know taking a nap I mean you have to be there you have to be involved you have to know you know quality control ... all of that\nYeah honey employees do have our right around like about forty five to while that's a lot of ever dream and you're now why or stream know that it would turn into this really turned it started from you having clients that were struggling without eating portion of things\nAnd then you figuring it out from there and it just kept growing but I think with your food and there are other places that do things like this I think your food is good and I think a lot of the things mimic comfort food we're a bills that satisfaction you know with the peanut butter bars are balls or whatever they're you know\nBack to people not wanting to be on a diet let's face reality like writing mind to ourselves is what I say like you're going to start some crappy diet that's gonna restrict you from so much and you're going to do good for like six weeks and then you're gonna die for the\nThe remaining for that you're on it and then you just say screw it you've learned nothing you've changed nothing and then you go back to your old self and then it what it does to you mentally it's horrible and if we do that to ourselves ... ourselves ... year after year sometimes twice a year\nI mean you just you lose confidence to really if I really think that you should break into the college market because I think Sabrina could fill her daughter raider yeah at washy with the stuff she doesn't have to go to the dining hall it's way more healthy it's way because they just eat whatever yeah I Know what I mean and she would like to eat healthy but I think\nGoing to eat healthy and going that I figure out a board I mean I Would like to eat healthy too but I hate to cook and I'm seeing I'm busy and so for me that's why this service works your company\nA really dug in her family out do them in office live deliver Sunday Monday Wednesday and friday do you do have a lot of that yeah yeah it's our new it's it's a new extension of the business we just started about a year ago\nA nickel you're bringing up your daughter kind of brings up a good point is there an average age in which a person's metabolism kind of does plummets\nSmog really thirty five to forty for males and then like females might even be a little bit younger than that I was divorced ends on the woman and like your hormones and post pregnancy what happens to your body after a pregnancy oh my goodness I Know why because\nI'm twenty six right now and I feel like I can pretty much eat almost anything you can really gaining weight but one of these days I'm going to turn into gross I mean there's no one's going to happen more than likely\nYou're going down to get your of fried toasted ravioli for lunch and making them or I'm going to run to the border\nOf yours coming I'm Still one by\nOne just one I'm like Matt just give me one pointed out of it be portion control because your portions are huge you know what I mean they're like the perfect modeling yeah I think in our realize you're eating three ounces of veggies and you get your rivals serving of the proper amount of carbohydrate which\nIs enough and then you eat right and if I dont see last night I had the naked\nSloppy Joe with the ... and the potato fries so good and so satisfying like unbelievably\nPerfect any like three hundred and eighty calories okay so gosh it do you have a way for somebody to go in there because I struggle with this when I go in what how how many calories a day should I be eating in order to lose\nAnd or maintain and then you can you just you just add that up I Know you've got new fall menu items that are out we'll talk about that in a second but what is the optimum amount of calories\nWhether you're an exercise or a non exercise or what do you suggest\nYou can't really answer that I Know you want me to answer that but it is so specific to everybody because you are so different than I Am and I'm so different than her and okay or activity level and maybe our goals and you know so that's why we have a registered dietitian aren't stashing meets with people because if\nShe explained so much and she could say okay you need to eat Fifteen to sixteen hundred calories and you know by getting three meals within this calorie range you'd be good and then you could go as far as tracking stuff on my fitness pal really dial in\nAll that that tracking and that that's a process and that's really going through the steps of making a changing really looking at what you're eating um but when I created this product I thought you know if people ate these meals I well I Know they'll lose weight I talked to a guy yesterday like Julie and I'm an eat your food for a year I've lost over a hundred pounds\nWas meeting with him on friday yes um he he's like it's changed my life I just I never felt like I was on a diet I just eat your meal that's it\nAnd he's like the food just does the work for you and I'm like that's perfect because if\nThey're also within like a hundred calories like if you eat three of 'em I mean they're not that different air all within the guideline find that you can add a snack in there for what hungry because you're a super active or something you would eat more you know what you need to start\nLike if you're starting from ground zero I mean even if you just say three meals a day from there just for a week to see what it would feel like they could take\nThough those practices and make a bowl oatmeal at home or on your own you know or have a chicken salad with an apple for lunch or something like that or you would you would start to learn proper portions and then the the the meals all fall from\nThree hundred four hundred and fifty calories like you know what I'm Talking about eighty you ever drink do you ever have a cocktail all the time [laughter]\nI Am an old girl\n... Ah yes I Do drink tequila and is that like the healthiest thing you can it's just wonderful\nI I don't know I have six\nCalories a shot and it um yeah I just feel better in the morning it doesn't have like all the tenants of wine and doesn't have a bunch of the sugars digest different than like vodka\nBut that's not really why I started drinking I just love the way it taste and I don't feel super hung over in the morning okay okay I'm not taking shots of tequila doing like any margarita know what a week I asked tequila on uh it's okay perfect I Know about it I've been doing it for a little over\nA year or two now and it's working it's great\nAnd the guy you just mentioned a moment ago you said last over one hundred pounds what did he mentioned doing a lot of exercise long without her\nYou know what I haven't talked to him yet I Know he does work out okay he does some activity actually yeah because we talked ville I mean I've had so many women come in ... especially nurses for whatever reason\nI just started getting your food I just eat it for lunch in last month I've lost seven pounds just eating lunch from you guys and I'm like 'cause you're not eating a sandwich or not eating process you're eating balanced like that one change that's consistent for a long period of time will render is I Will\nSay this about nurses I Love nurses and I feel like you know their schedules are crazier schedules are crazy and there's then there's like the downtime and everybody for me anyway like when my dad was in the hospital forever\nWhat did I Want to do I wanted to show some gratitude so what did I Do I brought in a tray of ... sandwiches and whatever you know it's like yeah horrible you know so I think that they get caught in that trap I'd never seen so many nurses over the years and listen to how hard it is with the stuff that\nThey have yeah I Would think of radio stations are like that to somebody's dragging food and you're all the time that's not the healthy we actually have a clear at mercy hospital where people can go get food while you're in ... all that work there great idea that is brilliant because hospitals I mean if you don't\nWhile you're in ... all that work there great idea that is brilliant\nBecause hospitals I mean if you don't want to give a hospital food which I think probably Ninety percent of the people there don't want to eat it so then you know you have to you know get carry out to go through a drive through ... could bring something from home but you know we don't have time to do anything else we can go to sit down place\nRight yeah that's true but it is a nice option to have an mercy mhm I'm not surprised that they would do that it's great hospital\nUm but anyway fit flavors a is a place where you can go they've got three locations they've got one in Chesterfield one in Brentwood and want to increase the core\nA and you can also go on line I Know this fall you have some new items and your pumpkin spiced situation and I love so tell us about what you have on your menu for the fall short of a lot of butternut squash out loud and Kay\nUm we have the salmon ... salad I'm really excited about is that new or something you wrote yeah it's just a it is something we've brought back we do have some really cool dishes that we bring back year after year because we know that people love them they're just so seasonal\nUm but uh like like with the butternut squash like we do a mashed butternut instead of a mashed potato it is so\nGood I ate it last night I'm like and we paired up with a smoke chicken and sweet\nHoney barbecue sauce like dynamite so you're getting a chef prepared meal that it's healthy for you it's ready to go it's no work it's simply a pop and you grab it and you're like yeah I mean that's kind of like if people say well\nI beat that if I were all probably kids over as a personal chef well this is what kind of courage up because sometimes people come in and ...\n... ... and we joke about it that people like okay I'm going to do it and we're like do what you eat food and they're like like they think that they have to be like on or off that flavors it's like a thing like I'm On the it's not a diet it's just eating better way of life and going somewhere else", "show_name": "The Peter Tilden Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "06"}
