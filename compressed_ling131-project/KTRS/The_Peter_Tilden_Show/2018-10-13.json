{"month": "10", "state": "MO", "station": "KTRS", "content": "[noise]\nYou're listening to handle those of you bring that show are settled by Rob Stein wrote auto centers when Jimmy ... novel five fifty a tiara [noise]\nComputing\nAnd may and everyone and welcome to the world why technology soccer\nIs getting ready to say on the Oklahoma City if you are with us here I\nCan't hear us calm tell your friends Katie arrest dot com did I get on the street and get on the ... and St Louis fc has an opportunity for the first time in franchise history to qualify for the playoffs that they win or tie in the match tonight kick off a set for seven thirty CEO certainly is along side and Dale it's a\nMuch anticipated tickets to this point tonight\nIt is it's exciting to get to this point in a you know I think the staff has done a good job of working their way through the season and through some of the ups and downs and its culminated in a in a game where where we can or we control our destiny and and hopefully put ourselves over the line\nI'm looking forward to this one tonight the weather's gonna be cool as there is going to be a breeze so we'll keep an eye on that maybe some rain late later in this er during this matched tonight civil wait and see but everything is right in front of his team tonight and a record crowd expected here at the soccer park so it's going to be even more fun with the atmosphere\nAnd we've had some momentum here over the last few home games where we've been getting more and more people in the stands and to have over six thousand people in the stadium tonight will be will be a great a great set up\nA lot of things going on and many things to talk about and vice president and general manager Jeremy Alan Ball kind enough to visit with us here it's the calm before the storm\nRight now it's a little calm here at the park at this time I'm of the of the game day but a whole success storm hopefully it's a lot of fun here tonight we got some work to do need to a kind of drive the staying home and and uh you know finish all of our business\nSeven consecutive wins for the team here at home coming into tonight's match the feel [noise] I got I imagine for the group\nTonight's match the feel I got an imagine for the group is when you're coming here to the park you have that confidence and you're almost you still have to go play the match but you just had that fear that feel or were come out and take care of business\nAnd I think the guys have been a good job of setting the tone it's something we've talked about since day one that the soccer bar can be a very tough place to play or the fans are on top of it is loud it's intimate there there's a good energy here and and the team has done a good job of being on the front foot\nUm you know at the home games and you know a set some setting the tone wasn't attacking\nJak in moments in in such that way so hopefully that's something that can continue here tonight and also the crowd can a push us to the result that we need\nGermany has been a successful season as Jim said seven\nSeven successive wins here at home I think we're tend to and for at home which is an amazing home record\n'em but over the course of the year we've had some ups and downs and and uh you know had some trials there in mid season is there anything that that that you can point to that says that was a moment that turned this group around and and that we this is where we felt like that we we started against momentum\nTo where we are today I think the natural thing would be to point towards the Reno game on the road where we won laid off the Sam's had her off the court has long throw in a we broke their streak gave us some confidence momentum that we'd be to\nYou know a team that have been in the playoffs here before in the west that I Want a bunch of games in a row or on beaten in a row sixteen I think it was\nSo I think that that that gave it but um you know more than that and I know what's going to sound cliche and boring but just the way that you know the staff and the team of going about their business\nDay in day out with a process it's been very much\nYou know this Tuesday is the same as last Tuesday whether we're you know for playing on Wednesday and has a certain ... certain field but\nIt's been very specific and and and very a planned out and very even keel I Would say which is not that they all can attest to not a strength of mind perhaps even killed I've worked very hard on that are in the last\nLast handful seasons but I think that Reno game for sure from a real soccer momentum standpoint that result was something that really you know kind of drove us here\nYou know you you talked about you know just sort of this even keel approach and and sort of the maturity of the players talk about um\nThe the purpose of the purpose full way you win about your business and\nWhen you put the rosters together the mature player a good cultural fits good people with somebody that you and Anthony apparently really went after in the in the very beginning with came to to making\nUp the roster yeah the biggest thing was trying to find guys that were more about uh you know more about the teen and they were themselves and really wanted to either prove something to be a part of something or ideally bowl and they wanted to really prove something to be a part of something so\nA lot of phone calls a lot of digging in a lot of background work a lot of you know just talking to different people that have known these guys play with them played against them coached him coach against them\nSo it's like a lot of time and um you know I think it's a it's a common thread that that locker room has is you know a good sense of a behavior and culture and beliefs and you know that was important as you said they'll you know through some you know since ... times this year where we were\nDressing guys trying to get through the game and trying to get through sixteen quote unquote guys healthy to plan a roster um but I think it's just um you know just doing homework and and having a good game plan and a good idea of what this group I'm needed to look like in order to have success\nAnd then you know having the flexibility through some of the ... we made\nIt's not something that gets thrown out their publicly but you know we sold in international roster spot early on to a team in eastern conference we sold another one late to a team in the in the eastern conference we moved um you know a player to Oklahoma City to get one that we then moved to Nashville to get Michael Cox and\nSo a lot of movements there and a lot of support from uh the leadership to allow us to bring in Tyler late to bring in and out of Jeff's into bringing up Michael Cox\nAnd as we sit here today we see how important those moves worse oh just patients and I try to stay even killed and then just really all that started back in October with Anthony and really okay this is what we want to be about this where we want them to believe in and then kind of piecemeal on it and put an altogether\nYou told us a story to have time for those who may have missed it about how Greg ended up here right that was a it quite interesting\nYeah yeah that was a it was crazy all of a sudden you know we get a we're looking for that last forward right every team wants more forwards and we made the decision to um to loan urban back out to you know to the to the club in El Salvador\nAnd we're kind of looking for that guy and unsure of you know who it was or what it was going to look like and\nYou know he's going to kick me next time he sees me if he if he hears me say it but we're looking at two guys and you know we we called Oklahoma City and mark coward and Jimmy Nelson said you got a choice between those two guys take towel Greg and things are those who listen to him\nAnd he is one of the guys which we spoke of earlier\nGot double digit goals and usually at your guy who's your strikers most confidence that saying he is but a lot of times that the guy with the biggest head in the room [noise] no he's not been that the ... showing it in his work great coming back and on the field I mean it's been pretty impressive to watch him for us yeah for sure and I\nThink um he set the tone with the goal scoring but everybody in the front lines of its own with their mentality [noise] you know ... Corey Michael Cox when he came in the goal that he scored from the pressure of Corey uh in in Kansas City we just set a tone of hard work comes first\nAnd then everything else will will slide into play and I think um [noise] you know that a good job of setting that tone and everybody um you know follow along\nBut across the board we're we're quite deep I mean we we went through we went through a July when I'm sure Anthony was looking over his shoulder dawn how am I going to change the game but at this stage no we still have a couple of injuries but\nWe have Anthony has some choices that he can make both just started a line up and to to change the game during the during the game\nWhatever happens tonight we have the ability to impact the game defensively for on the attack inside was ups and there's not too many teams at this point the season that can say that so yeah maybe so and so or maybe so and so's\nNot available um but we can make some in impactful changes tonight on the other side of the ball and that's huge and everybody in this roster has been very very important\nAnd and the team you know we talked about some of the trials and tribulations we went through throughout the injuries and whatnot during the season but that's turned into a positive for this group\nOr as we got through those little struggles now we see competition for positions guys that may have not had a lot of time during the early part of the year of this has turned into a positive competitive environment for the team\nMuch so I mean I think it was a\nYou know some dog days of summer so to speak where we were trying to get through it but um we did and then I think when you know what it really you know a\nCame out to was that one guy came back from injury they had to really perform in order to get their spot back and uh you know we were really able to to push through with some some depth in some different guys to to really driving home and\nAgree with you there alone or are orange county's at the top of this list but in reality the St Louis fc when they came here I thought played Orange County very well and yes they've got guys like ... votes\nIn up top and all that but St Louis played well against some wasn't like they were out man than any\nOf my my thought on Orange County is\nJust systematically they are the best the middle east in terms of how they're organized how they tried to play with the talent that they have\nThey don't they don't kill you with athleticism our individual ism it's more\nIt's more a collective group that that gets things done then I think we match up with that level of organization it's hard to match up with the the level of athleticism a and a individual well at the individuality of Phoenix or\nA real monarchs something we can we talk to Jeremy about I talked to I think that the press conference earlier in a week and it\nJust your thoughts on how difficult it is to get the team's first mentality\nOn a soccer team because\nWhen I read a lot of stories about teams in England the stars up top like well it's about me and if I'm not playing well you know and and you see that I mean they're like that but that seems to be the mentality where the guy up top as him playing well\nThen the rest of the teams lousy or you know and if he's not happy than the rest of the team's not happens hard it that's not an easy thing to accomplish what's been accomplished here if you just\nTake a look at the um\nTake a look at this level let's leave that next that's a different level level out of it was thick of this little coach Steve Cook with okay see tonight has to has to be talking to his players about playing for a contract what's happening for next year and so how do you\nHow do you measure that how do you mesh as a as a player playing for a contract\nBut also trying to beat team first um and I think that's where so much of a of the work\nThat Jeremy an Anthony did in I'm In the pre season and the off season with trying to find the right players to fit the culture of this group and that's where we that's where the club got it so wrong a year ago\nRight no I was saying names but from the top down you know it was not a it was not a good set up for a for the players and and for the for the team and it did not fit the club culture um\nThis year uh I think Anthony and Jeremy have done a a really good job of finding good people to be a part of this club and then once qualified as good people and team first guys were the good enough players to to fit what Anthony was looking to get done in the team\nThat sale Shelley I'm Jim hear or see on the pitch ... show here from worldwide technology soccer park bill McDermott is here he'll join us at just about twenty after seven when we go up top to the broadcast booth whatever after nine days show tonight\nWe're expected to have a very long extended\nPost game show that could be a long extended post game show tonight and hopefully you know athletes are really low hopefully we're not all trying to figure out how to get out [laughter] you know hopefully it's it's a long post game show where we can uh can enjoy each other's company and and have a good time with with everybody and people stopped by the table and\nThen having a having a good conversation about the the result and then what's gonna happen the play offs\nIt's the first opportunity for this franchise to make the playoffs\nAnd you've been involved with uh the entire time\nWhere is where do you think it it means to this franchise to get this close in and be on the cost of where this is that right\nWell obviously it's taken a lot of blood sweat and tears from a lot of people to to get to this point\nWhen when we were in the inception of the of of the team and the idea of trying to to put us all team together\nOr we all thought it was going to be including me [laughter] so I was going to be a piece of cake to put this together with outsmart the next guy and figure out how would get into the playoffs\nAnd um it just it's it's not that way it's it it's a lot of work a it's a difficult league it's a difficult week from a talent perspective it's a difficult league because of the restrictions that your own organization puts on a\nOn the team from a financial perspective and you can certainly get out there in this league for for players\nAnd talent in the league is extremely important look at Cincinnati phrase night um however and and the other difficult part is is scouting and understanding the level of the league and it took us\nTwo years to figure that out again last year was was a difficult year\nBut I think we learn from all three years culminated in a good guy\nWho's let a good staff um you know Anthony and and his staff and then putting the right players together the right people there let's put it that way but the right people together to ah to represent the organization\nFrom an Anthony ... standpoint paper\nFrom an ethnically pure standpoint paper [noise]\nSome people are just coming up for the first time in the last couple weeks 'cause the crowds are getting bigger and when you're winning that's that's what happened what what is this team what isn't it that if your team\nIf somebody comes he said well what what am I expect and what am I going to see\nI think those smart outside of the player selection or the you know the people that they selected um [noise] I think Anthony coaches\nTo toward this lead toward being successful and us lick\nAnd that is defense first organized first ah and then capitalize on mistakes from the opposition\nUm and so you'll see a high number of our chances I'm number of our goals come from either our press or on counterattacks and then another high percentage of our goals come off of re starts which is just preparation\nNot a lot of it's going to come from our ball possession the front half of the field but that's not the way the team set up to the team is set up with a solid back for with outside backs and gets forward [noise]\nTo holding feel players that defense first and connect the game first and then a front for that can that can play a little bit but if that's your set up\nThen you have to you have to be able to play on the brake and uh and and do the sort of pressing thing that you need to do to capitalize on other teams to six\nEspecially our gym here let's take a break when we come back we've got more on the pitch\n... show we will hear from the head coach at the fuel is coming up a little bit later on we also have our starting eleven has that will be delivered to us here shortly and then about twenty minutes we'll get to that but we have many things to get to it so when you're in night here at the soccer park and we'll take a break and come back
