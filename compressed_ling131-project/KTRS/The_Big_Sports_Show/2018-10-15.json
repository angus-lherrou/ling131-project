big by the PR ass\nAxon movie by the PR at\n... how are ya I went back I think you doing well sir had a great job you know I Know we're going to talk about space seeing movies I'm not one of those guys that are you know I like the you know the aliens was was fun for me to watch like ... you know but I'm not a huge psi phi guy and I thought well you know I'm going to school myself and\nWe're a little bit about some of the space movies maybe I didn't I looked up space movies on line and I'm telling you it's an bliss and I came across some adults space movies I have no idea if you're going to do anything with those but\nWhat I Know like for a you know happy fun\nTime in the middle of the night I didn't even\nWas no fair share of the ... the Tampa, Florida\nThe wrong side I Know no thank you for knowing that\nThough yes I mean I just can't believe I'm Talking about here right now the fact that it's against the movie that are reviewing this week on my show ... movies is called first man\nAnd oh yeah it's a biotech about Neil Armstrong who of course was the first human being to step foot on the moon if you believe that should that Wright Patt as a flat earth or I'm not sure I Do that but uh I thought I Would talk about some other a space the movies and of course\nThere are huge movies that everybody knows and loves like Apollo Thirteen to die but I wanted to try to address the more obscure ones that are a whole can of course dream right now on various during services if you just Google you can find them on a ... word and Netflix or Amazon and the first one is a film that I only recently\nDiscovered it was a box office flop when it came out and I was a little surprised because I saw this back in the late eighties on VHS and it was on to VHS because it's about four hour movie\nAnd this thing is an ethic and I thought it was just amazing and I think now it's social circles it's really I'm a respected and it's kind of amazing cast a shift as santhara shepherd you Sam shepherd panda Dennis Quaid and it's so many great people are in this movie is called the right stuff you know\nAnd this will be course based on the book by Tom Wolfe who's a great American writer I didn't realize this flopped at the box office\nNor did either I saw a movie and I liked it but I realized it was that long\nIt was very long it's a very long film and maybe that hurt the box office because you tell people hey let's go see a four hour movie about the first astronaut\nSo if you're not but it is a wonderful wonderful films you haven't seen it it's probably the film that's closest in tone to first man\nI Will say the first miners are definitely a a a melancholy film it's really inward looking at what Neal was thinking and feeling when he was a signing up for all these different that uh you know a missions and of course was what he was feeling and thinking when he was on the moon which is kind of a an amazing thing I hate to sound sort of\n... maybe cliche here but can you believe that we walked on them you know I I it's one of those feelings that comes back when you're watching these movies like we actually did this we actually went there and walks around that seems to me and\nYou know it's even more insane is that we walked in the mode and yet we can't get all of the studios at one temperature\nFor true very true that might be colder than the surface of the minute ride out now you have\nTo know that when I was gonna say you're you're talking about what you're holding so don't tell people you're holding talks about I've been playing with this will be pushing the whole time I got to work I just I thought to have a conversation with you and you're holding your\nFrom sharing a get it when I was gonna say is that what's even more wild when you think about space we actually get pictures high def pictures from Mars you ever watch or even look at some of those pictures that we get planets sure sorry I didn't mean that I mean if you believe in all that stuff once again\nAs like what are their butts off at a time when I had a film\nThat was directed by a guy to Douglas Trumbull who did a lot of the special effects for great space movies like two thousand one and she worked on the first Star Wars and uh she did a film [noise] excuse me a with Bruce Stern in the lead role called silent running because heard of this year there was in the mid seventies I thought\nThat was the flooding\nMovies so silent running is this post apocalyptic movie where are they similar plant life on earth and so we're looking for different planets where we can terra form or the planet and so she is\nShe's alone on this ship and he is built some robots to keep him company and again very melancholy a very you know slow moving a film a boat thing that I ... I\nRemember from watching it when I was a kid is it the three robots are named Huey Dewey and Louie down on that now the exactly which is pretty cute by it definitely has a sort of a sad or in the running is a good sort of science fiction of reminds\nMe of ah what are the ... the the Marshall Marshall\n... that was a bit more rousing crowd pleaser Seattle is entirely running is not yeah I'm a ... another film that I'm just one little walking to talk about now because Kevin Spacey voices a computer\nAnd so at the time I was like wow what great casting Kevin Spacey like now like I Wish they could read the other way because of a former navy why would I Do they could but it's a film starring us there are well uh there was directed by David Bowie son Duncan Jones struck the something called mood\nAnd streaming I think it's on Netflix right now and uh this is about a guy play by state rep well who is working alone on them or some sort of\nA deal for for this you know for NASA or whatever NASA is in the future and he's sending them back tapes but he's alone and he's certainly it starts to go batty and uh that his replacement shows up\nAnd I don't want to say anything more than that but it's called moon and it is really really wonderful to us there ... won best supporting actor last year for three billboards outside ebbing Missouri and if you've ever watched a lot of his stuff he's really wonderful misspelled what what year was that\nA moon I Want to say it was about a two thousand five maybe six\nAgo that was the plan that was the plan all along to do that at least one in five years or the bills but when I was the anti championship I was injured early but then the next four years of Super Bowl years so I've done a good five years in the NFL team for Super Bowls\nOf it for you [laughter] but yeah that was the plan I grew up as a as the son of a film director I grew up with\nSean Penn Chris Penn Rob Lowe sharp animal you like to have a direct and he's given young guns produced and directed that felt so I knew I was going to end up in that field I as a writer as an actor [noise] um but I just figured I'd get some more time in the NFL first\nI was wrong that did have a nice fall that class\nI think I've only got about a minute left with you so of course I have to bring up Lois and Clark is the twenty fifth anniversary of this groundbreaking show I I I Know that the New York ... they did a discussion about calls for a new season ... do you have any idea how you would handle the cliffhanger twenty plus years later\nBy as as a screenwriter for Thirty years ago I absolutely do let me handle that I Would just you know to make that child a child they they raise for awhile and they were protecting and then they go elsewhere\nAnd then of course I Would have them have their own children and find out where they are twenty five years later I Would love to see where Lois and Clark or twenty five years on and what what they're like his parents and and\nThe the because you're never so vulnerable as you are being parents sure I'm sure about that give more than anything more than your own life and I think it'd be interesting to see them as parents\nWith kids you have some you know some fledgling super powers [laughter] it'd be fun to sort of recreate that I'd love to catch up with the characters are out there still happily married and had a strong as ever so that would be fun to see\nWonderful well the movie is golf now my guest is dean king thank you so much for the conversation ...\nMax I appreciate it thanks again for the NFL\nRight before my telephone line was connected to maintain the producer of the media tour said you've only got about four minutes with them were doing a live with another station next so I had a lot more questions for dean that I wasn't able to get to this time\nBut uh you know hopefully down the road will do some more media and we can have the chance to catch up the great pleasure of meeting him twice over the past few years at the metropolis Superman celebration and so I can echo here when I told them in person and that's that while he's associated with Superman\nI've always thought his performances Clark Kent\nWas really really wonderful and you know the list of actors who play instruments pretty short and it's always fun for fans to see the Superman together I Know he's pretty cordial with Brandon routes and Tom willing\nAnd if you're a fan of Dean I recently caught a Denzel Washington movie called out of time and he turns up as a villain and let me tell you he's cherry in that film hopefully it's more villains in the future as well that's my interview with dean Jane this is max on movies following me on Twitter max on movies and thanks for listening to the big five fifty shades

max on movies armor who's max Boise here are the review of first man here's my conversation with John Grisham the dinner for bloom on the inside\nIs the story the impossible story about a bunch of people who decide that they want to go and land on the moon and walk around ... when these guys made it happen it's also set in its time period what with the Cold War raging politics the way they were like you got the sixties going it's fertile\nOr raging politics the way they were what you get the sixties going at fertile ground for a story that caught me alone up these clean cut fellows in the middle of that time period going to the moon so America ... it is so we did it\nAnd this is a film that I Believe ... Blume is going to see today look at you and uh and why the why the rush opening day I see more movies since I've started listening to max and working with and then I think I had in the past ten years a little credit for ... I feel I think that's wonderful I think that's absolutely fantastic\nI've read more books this year one year or so let's talk about first men there have been so many films about a landing on the moon about the missions to the moon\nAnd I think we've all seen most of them I Do feel like required viewing I think for a lot of Americans are writers stuff you've got the right stuff you've got the other missions to space like Apollo Thirteen or you've got hidden figures which came out a couple of years ago which was really the untold story\nOf the black female mathematicians that helped us do this something that none of us learned in school which made me very angry ... do you know there's forty fifty years later we finally get a movie about those young women\nBut all these movies you could watch shouldn't figures and the right stuff and the first man they're all about the same\nCollection of people you got your Gus Grissom you've got your Buzz Aldrin you got your Neil Armstrong the good thing about first man because I think some people are saying why are we seeing this film again we've seen this story a lot\nI mean we we were just talking about a star is born being roommate four times well how many missions to the moon [laughter] to see what's nice about first men and really the reason why I'm recommending and the reason why I enjoyed it is because this is telling a very different story\nPurposely this is about Neil Armstrong full stop that said one man it's not about the space program at large it's not about America it's not about patriotism it's about one man it was based on a book called the life of Neil Armstrong and by James are Hanson\nAnd because of this the movie takes a very narrow focus is only concerned about what this one human being was thinking and feeling when you signed up for these missions\nHow it affected his family his wife his kids and of course it is also sort of in first and hints at his thoughts while he actually was the first man to walk on the moon spoiler alert she did\nA places for it on a lighter ruin over here when the end of the moves that this film is directed by Damien shows al or would that might not be a name that you are recognized however he's an Academy Award winning director is one of the youngest uh to win best director he directed the movie called whiplash\nWith miles Taylor and um and ah oh my lord what does this other people will know he won best supporting actor or the guy from the farmers insurance or commercials I Can't think of his name right now some added this back in when I was you know when you made so\nNo anyway okay so that I use that if you're not just gave me but anyway he followed that up with a movie called la la land which I Know I'm a girl mill haven loved and I also love this is my favorite film of that year and that won best actress for a Emma Stone so the so his his crew is cast usually wins wars he's very talented young men and first third a feature\nA you chose this movie this are reaching some with Ryan Gosling\nWho is not in his charming la la land mode and this is more of his um silent Dr mode if you watch this film called drive from a couple of years ago which was phenomenal films\nVery violent disturbing moody film but gossiping barely spoke a word the entire time he's able is one of these actors she was able to convey a lot through facial expressions and body language he also did that in Blade Runner two thousand forty nine\nEverybody [laughter]\nHell and is it one of these deals where we finally get to see behind the curtain a little bit and and see that it's reality it's ... again it was always sort of one of those unspoken on ... like you said it's just sort of understood it's part\nOf the game but now that we know we have this really is part of the game and you know it comes out an FBI investigation um the fact that we're all again and I'm as guilty as anybody I I'm I'm looking forward to the season I just dropped my shoulders and say it's part of the deal\nAren't we just sort of enabling these guys to continue to operate like\nAren't we just sort of enabling these guys to continue to operate like this\nI don't know I don't think there was a curtain I don't think there was any surprise\nEverybody you know what's going on it was just shocked and practice if you are you're going to get offers me start with you and me with the Arabs in the day everybody knew at Georgetown you Elvie chances schools were offering\nMoney to come play there at my ... you know if you think about the coach who's going to get my son the best deal I just don't think it's a big surprise or anything and I don't even know the FBI and waste their time everybody knew it\nSo highly somebody got kicked off enough\nFor them to do a quote investigation and I don't know what kind of in front of everybody it's just part of a deal\nWhile I'll agree with you there I don't I don't understand why money was invested into this uh what ultimately has gained other than you know one of these Adidas executives getting a you know getting thrown in jail for mail fraud uh you know what what again at the end of the day what was really accomplished\nOr somebody in a shoe companies somebody off or bell south or somebody\nYou know ... you know we're off the line somewhere and somebody said okay well we'll show you all go ahead and expose you like they needed to be exposed and make you look you know make it look like you broke about the role that everybody else's and breaking meanwhile\nEverybody's doing it just kind of like the steroid controversy everybody's doing it wrong [laughter] everybody is\nHaving college players an opportunity to make money or to get better deals or whatever is it wrong field as well it's just\nThe actually the sheriff forty million or the Big Ten or twelve million [noise] they have more money away this part of the deal and now that's why they get a lotta shoulders charged with us whatever right Riley somebody else knows about it besides uh [laughter]\nI'm with you I like I said I'm looking forward to the season I I kind of just uh I I Try to toss it aside and and I'm ... and not give two thoughts about it but it's out there and I think maybe we should be paying attention to it but nobody seems to be so or\nShouldn't be outraged you talk about you know we want to be paid right then and I think that's one thing that nobody ever said\nThey are being paid they're being paid not only watch me realistic for five seconds here a lot of college players and big universities are being read on it\nAnd people don't want to admit that aren't getting paid the ... and the care to the lower level do you want schools those kids aren't getting paid [noise] there's a lot of college players getting paid just because your kid doesn't happen to be one of them doesn't mean it's not happening\nAnd I think some of them are but I think there's a lot of I I Would say the majority of the kids that aren't the the big name you know potential pros down the road\nI don't think they're getting paid I don't think they're getting paid and valleys schools or else you know an old school is what I'm saying yeah it's a ... really appreciate the call thanks a lot of stuff\nOr thanks for the call a nine to ... to get much more on this uh\nTopic within Frederick students from the St Louis Post Dispatch our very own here at the big science in the coming up in the seven o'clock hour it's all very interesting and I'm not I I think damn and hit the nail in in ... hit the nail on the head it is a lot like the whole steroid thing from\nTwenty some years ago where you knew what was happening but it's also you know to enjoy the sport and enjoy the the pomp and circumstance you you you tend to look the other way\nAnd then had a great line and we'll talk about it and the seven\nDay a great line at the end of his column a wet you know\nOh essentially wins March Madness wins March Madness going to get here because just like you know just like last year all this FBI stuff by the time to turn an old around nobody cares nobody talked about it this was a story last year in September and October\nAnd the season starts and it's just like oh well let's get back to the basketball nobody really seems to care about all of the stuff on the periphery that may or may not be impacting your school or your your your favorite player yet to me only care if it's like a rival school or\nHopefully answer eating this up if if if the oldest is implicated in and again the testimony that came out today\nThat builds up allegedly a made a phone call to one of these Adidas executives sinking him for a ... their freshman last year as a sophomore this season and he's not even close to being their best\nPlayer on Kansas but if he makes a phone call thinking what obese executives when was the fans are gonna have a field day over and they had a field day about it today ... beat scare did not want at well don't worry those little kids had been implicated in ... for now it's far far far away\nFrom this as a ... schools you know like I said now these schools and the zoo there all the all appear to be very far away from any type of implications we like it because oh Kansas or oh North Carolina or ... and he actually UNC seems to be a ... they they they're in and out of these investigations\nSees on the screen snow and the
