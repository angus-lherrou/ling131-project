tide and coach Joe John Finley and a coach we appreciate you being here we understand that it's a tough loss right now for the guys how what's the mood in that locker room after the game\nWas heartbreaking guys I mean you know how bad they want it you can tell the football field a\nTerrible forum I don't know how hard they work for all we got to give credit to Kentucky it's a really good defense costs to the coast sunlight and there are guys we're we're heartbroken a\nReady to stick together and then move onto the next one\nYou know in the first half you found some success running the football you had a good mix scene from drew lock the did you feel at half time that you really kind of had the game plan that you want it against the cats and then when the things that may be changed the Kentucky adjusted to in the second half\nOh we did we felt good was was what we're doing the first time we knew it was going to be a game where we didn't get that many possessions because of what they do on off and so we knew we had to take advantage of the opportunities that we had nothing we did that\nGood way and the first house and then a second have just came out and I never really could get it going you know we're we're teaming always talks about trying to get the first person down that way we can utilize our temple and\nAnd ah weren't able to do it the second half in a post ... rating for our guys frustrating for us as coaches and uh [noise] got to find a way to get better for me\nWas that the Kentucky defense maybe that you had seen on film in that second half that came out and kind of kept the pressure it felt like at times in the field and they definitely were staying very close they were taken some risks I thought of that second half honestly to try to stay to you guys in and keep the clamp on it\nI think I think it was in the ... the whole time you know they were playing well in the first guys were just execute him a little bit better I think we're putting them a little bit better situation in the in the first time so it's\nIt's a ... a\nI'm laws and uh\nWe got to do a better job of putting our guys in a better situation and then they go to do a good job of executing what we call and we know that we're going to stick together and we're going to get ready for the next one I Know\nThat the final Dr hertz but up until that point the way that your defense performed answering the bell again and again and again that somebody with an offensive minded on that side of the ball Joe John\nI'm sure that that had to be very heartening to see them play with a lot of effort intensity throughout the game and play very well against the Kentucky often that likes to gas you for big plays on the ground it and I thought that you handle that very well throughout the game\nMatriculate the ball down the old um budge you know\nFrustrating a quarter Kentucky made great place where they needed to a stroke poised to come back with a football game the Missouri often just could not get the job done on a second house\nWell and you know even if you take it down into still it into the final nine seconds of the contest ... from the yard line and ... figuring okay surely this is about the end and Jerry Wilson throws to the back\nOf the end zone and you could say that it may be what the past but if you want to call a defensive pass interference against the market safety I mean you watch it over again\nIf you can call it all fits with the receiver was all over a defender\nRight I'm not going to say that you know the referee hey it his judgment call I understand it's a tough job but in those sorts of situations I think what's frustrating to coaches and what's frustrating the players that it feels like half the time you're allowed to play through that and half the time get ended up going called in something like that happens ate\nIt again feels like an instance where the game ends with is on time down where that that was part of the outcome at of course because it happened at the end of the game and it gives that extra play it's a big part of the outcome and then died and goes up against\nA defensive back on the final play and C. J. Conrad of course he gets his little push off and it gets to the corner and the ... in the past is on time from Wilton and it's those little things about a\nForty or fifty times throughout the second half but somehow add up to where Missouri was very much in control of the game and then at the end it wasn't there for\nThe yeah be curious to see a if anything comes from the officiating office from the SEC conference about the pass interference whether or not it should or should not have been called\nTo get the time down the middle of the very last play the game or the ... being too flags on the ground from officials and they ended up just picking them up and never made any saying what they were for all if it was crowded and fear or whatever from the end of the game but\nHe'd be curious to see what's sad to see if this is the second game where something gets the grossly\nHas officially I think we can talk about officiating can't we just just the coaches that candidate I guess so the coaches don't want to the coaches can I think the coaches get fined if they talk too much but it was just very interesting event of a political or play calling but officiating down there just watch the replay again of the pass interference in the end zone and makes my\nBlood boil even more but [noise] all boils down to you've got to make plays when you're in the position to win a football game the way we were um up by nine points you got to go put the ball game away\nAs the tigers fall to Kentucky Fifteen fourteen and we're breaking it down here on the bus you wrap up show a part of the story of this game is the fact that the ... and the second half ran into this Kentucky defense we had all been hearing about and it was tough to get even\nA first down no first down corporate donated upon eight times in that second half and the Dodgers got forty nine yards you can credit Kentucky for sure for being able to force that to happen but uh\nBut you can credit Kentucky for sure for being able to force that to happen but uh in Chile when it comes down to what you've got to find some sort of way\nTo get that first down or two and then put the game on ice if you have that opportunity because the defense I don't think you can have loved to the way that Missouri played up until that last drive on the defensive side of the\nBall well if you think about any one of those I was driven out if we get one first down I think we easily run another minute off the clock um sometime in the third quarter early in the fourth quarter ... been talking about the situation at the end of the ball game they were talking about the return for touchdowns Kentucky has so\nI'm just plenty of missed opportunities the good thing is I Will be plenty of film to look at and say here's the block was ms tears the read that was most by the quarterback here as a whole does miss brother running backs are lots of coach both teachable opportunities coming out of this whole\nGet into the more specifics will break things down we'll have our may I trusted choice player of the game as well but it's a tough one in Columbia tonight is Missouri falls to Kentucky\nPast the final horn on another time down fast from Terry welcome to C.

I ... in the second half you could say was Cori ... tigers in the game a ... few good punch he was painting any but on that last Dr Curtis Seventy pin\nKentucky back to the fish uh I Would give a nod as well to Jonathan Johnson the way he played in that first after this was probably one of his most consistent games is a tiger we ended up ... plus yards\nOn for catches um\nDefensively I think Torres hall was disruptive kale Garrett I I think the ultimate sign of how the defense was working in scale gear it ends up with fourteen tackle that is exactly what Barry autumn in the tigers wants to have happened and now with limited if I could give a player of the game\nMaybe to that defensive crunch Devon whenever it was against that Russian game of the cats you could say it that way today too because I think they perform a ... gallon against a team that is used to getting a lot more out of that facet of it's all fat\nIn Kentucky just had a hundred and twelve yards on the ground today and that they they live off the wrong game and beneath bill junior and he said Missouri's number since he was I think he plays a true freshman member that\nComing in and all this kid going to be good then that's what he has been and will do a held him big time today for maybe ... yards average a three point if I were just phenomenal did you notice\nAnything if you were watching down in the trenches Curtis that seemed different about what Kentucky was doing up front in the second half compared to the first half I didn't\nKnow anything in particular they were just ... they were getting the pressure they needed the coverage is there on passing place them on running plays were just you know we were just for getting the block towards the state of the blocks long enough\nThe tigers rush for a total of two point four per carry on average out in the night but to Mario ... rocket and Larry around tree I mean I think of the ways you had to win this game right Kentucky's a team that had this great red zone defense coming in whenever you got it in the red zone you really had to score seven points and Missouri did that twice in this game that\nThat felt like it was a big win and then the way it played out\nAnd Kentucky was rolling through different quarterbacks they tried gone our hope for a series or to a ... in Oregon and Jerry Wilson comes in at the very end and engineers does drive but\nYou don't really think about what the tigers did against Wilson all day he looked tentative he didn't look ready to throw into tight windows in Missouri I thought to advantage of that and if you take away the final six to seven eighty seven yards from Wilton he's thrown for under ... hundred two hundred yards on the day and he's thrown in interceptions\nYeah the there was a driver Missouri often tattoo you know we talk about score points you know a few ago would have been huge from Missouri here\nMissouri started on the Kentucky thirty nine at the start of the fourth quarter ... thirty nine yard line\nWithin nine yards of being in pretty sure if people go range of the wind was pretty much a non factor today that I think we start to drive off with a penalty that puts us behind the change we ended up having to put the football\nAt that point in time to try and put them deep and I feel like wait a minute for a touch back if memory serves me correctly yes um and so we had a net forty are out there that was driving it all turned to of being a game changer where you have the ball and great fuel position because I feel like Kentucky had to shake butter we had a good point return I Believe\nHow to get us the thirty nine yard lied and they were not able to do anything with it but that to me is the my turning point part of the game\nI think that's a fair turning point to say for sure it started at the Kentucky thirty nine yard line Alberto got that for a false start\nAn injury lock ended up with a stack and there was ... and again and really look at Alan spinal that line and you're worried about him coming into this game about what he could do\nThe purchase of any hard side box by undersea the chair and never a bad time to visit our GPS in valley

dog [laughter] thirty six to Seventeen Georgia gets the victory and I'll say this you know Florida gets all the plot it for the way that their defense has performed but Philippe Frank's against the Georgia defense only goes for a hundred and six yards passing in this game ah\nThe Rhine Russia's for sixty to Florida is probably coming off of that loss in saying that we might have some off into questions to ask of ourselves and away Missouri the fence late today if there's ever going to be a time to put up a back to back effort it's going to be next week trying to get some people in the swamp feeling a little bit nervous than the later stages of that game [noise] yeah I I\nI said I'll say it again for the third week in a row of feel like we match up pretty well against Florida or thing but thinks about as far as we're going down into the swamp\nAnd seeing the swamp sometime in the daytime they won't be a night game but\nWe'll figure out what all that looks like I think tomorrow was when they'll finally announced the game time for that one at Vanderbilt gotta win forty five thirty one of our Arkansas also Vanderbilt gets there first league when the ... seven in ...

Bryson's fantasy given credit that early seventies three lead with about five minutes and change to go in the second quarter so it may be feeling a little bit positive after that big went over Auburn and not letting Alabama beat him the week after\nUh they're they're playing some good football that they're doing better which I knew first your head coach somewhat Arkansas is an image should because the the amount of recruits that are very very good players and ruin a tendency is phenomenal how many good recruiting class that they can get year in and year out and yet they have done nothing for

in an interesting environment to say the least I don't know what you thought Curtis maybe the toughest up at the environment you played in was I just can't imagine hearing fifty thousand people were in those at your lifetime more cowbell\nBy they always ask for more and somehow they get to have it and they don't like noise makers other places but the cowbell is what the cowbell is still a lot that's what's going on across the league has some of the really\nPowerful teams at the top if you will or Alabama autobiographies you buy this week offered to buy as well so we'll be seeing them in short enough water\nFinally Kurdish you know we mentioned it before and we ask coach friendly but turning around from one like this the only thing you can do is try to go out the next week and performed your best and form misery\nAnd for drew lock in and for the defense in general after that second half\nThere might be a lot of things to look at and a lot of things to go over but deep in the end is there an element of this where hey you have to trust your stuff and you have to trust what you do if if the results aren't they're still kind of have to fight forward with it because you're not going to get anywhere trying to stay down on yourself heading into a top ten opponent perhaps ... Fifteen opponent next week I think you just have\nTo go in and talk to your cells and coaches the players and players to players and just say everybody just needs to give a little bit more it's a little bit more practice that's a little bit more preparation watching film about seeing tendencies and give it a little bit more that game again\nNext week and then the the outcome of changes which it should if everyone gives a little bit more there are things we can get a little bit better\nWell we'll see the tigers next in the swamps to Florida don't have a start time yet for the arrive alive

week taking a little time off and that's okay because she carries the heavy load with all the planning and\nArranging our gas and she is our hostess with the most is so she'll\nBe back next week I promise you that [laughter] but today we're talking to Alicia McMahon she is a financial advisor with northwestern mutual right here in St Louis or offices increase core ah we talked to a little bit Alicia about um you know being a mom and the balance the work life to family balance\nBut now I Want to kind of go a little deeper with you and talk about a financial planning itself and I I Will tell you that I Am not a great person when it comes to the financial planning side of things but I Will tell you\nThat when I started in radio hundred and fifty years ago it was like [laughter]\nI think I was ... to when I first started working for CBS and there was this form that was on my desk and I said you know four one K. and actually guy Philips who works here now full circle moment at the big five fifty K. terrorists\nI shared an office with him at that time and I was like what is it so far all and K and he's like no no no you want to do I mean I was making peanuts to begin with he's like no don't take the full Fifteen Percent and put it away put it away you got to do a trick trust me just check the box you'll be glad you did so fast forward to a hundred and twenty\nYears later [laughter] I've asked you know right\nExactly I'm I'm so thankful I did that because that little bit that I probably could've spent it you know ... or Walmart or target or whatever ended up um\nGrowing and and actually I have a nest egg because of that which is which is great but I Do most people start out in their twenties thinking of a financial plan\n[noise] no I mean I I definitely think um it it takes you know helping people through that process I mean I meet people all the time that haven't taken advantage um so getting people to act I mean people talk about\nHow they do feel empowered in and and more confident when they have a financial plan but a lot of times they're just almost frozen and need help acting on that\nPlan will because it is overwhelming they gave me a little here I Am twenty two of my home I mean I didn't even know that I had to have the oil changed in my car my life much less a financial plan around\nAnd this is not being talked about like it really should be so I mean you're\nRight you're right I mean why don't they go into high schools and my other I could get on my soapbox but you know where they really need to do is to professional athletes their first couple of years they need to be required absolutely to take classes and learn about\nFind because I've seen that my whole life being around the world of baseball my whole life I've seen these people that are walking around making so much money and their two year olds carrying the Lou Louis right on Twenty years later they're broke as a joke you know and\nI always say you know I'm you know not having a financial plan is a plan at the plant are failing bad and I get why are you doing now and so you bring up a really good point though is um in really my mission is to take the intimidation factor out of planning\nBecause so often people are completely intimidated by a conversation even right on and so I approach people you know all the time and it built my entire business over Eighteen years of you know just introducing myself and people continuing to refer me um and you know I approach people with the\nOpportunity to meet and connect and with no attachment whatsoever to the outcome I think that is so key because I think so often people are kind of scared to have that ... and it's like hey with no attachment whatsoever to the outcome let's talk about what\nThe guy wants that said I Want to come up with a financial plan for you is like\nHow much money would you like to make in retirement and my husband and I looked at each other\nAs much as possible I mean we get to like pick a number or is it based on\nWhat we have I mean you can't you can't just do like a pie and this guy I Want to make five million a year when I retire and then there are good at ten million I mean that the right like you're not going to like what they tell you need to do to get there [laughter] you don't have anything close to them you need to get twenty five more jobs like I said\nLook I mean you know this too relates to me is um with financial yeah fitness and physical fitness yeah you know when you think about physical fitness and wanting to lose weight you know you use the ... about a number and you come up with a plan and it's really the same thing with financial fitness as you know what what is your ultimate goal\nWhat are the things we need to do to get you there and then you continue to work on that plan and build on that\nThat makes sense I mean I'm not achieving either one but it makes [laughter]\n\nSo Alicia in a typical white one session can you set up an entire financial plan for somebody to how long would it typically takes an adult it's always ongoing\nAnd you know on the very first meeting and and this is what I think about all the time as the advisor relationship is so personal and I feel like it's really really important to meet somebody and have an authentic relationship where you can I Love your show girls talk like\nThat that's really what it is it's like you should be able to sit down with somebody and really just share everything right and be talking about these are what my goals are you know this is what I have so

All right there you go dot com yeah All right ... and and dot com\nAlright for North western mutual so um we've kinda covered a lot so far today talking about financial planning and a women balancing the home and the workplace and how all of that comes together or I Want to talk about a couple of specific things\nUh the Roth IRA versus the IRA okay so tell us what the differences\nSo really the um you know traditional i._r._a. is pre tax dollars going in your growing the money with no taxes but then when you pull that money out you'll pay taxes on it\nThe ... is after tax dollars and you're growing that money without taxes and you don't have to take it out at the end you're not paying any taxes have been okay I can be ... for ... so what\nAre the parameters though for a Roth diarrhea versus the IRA\nTheir income restriction so depending on your income a lot of people can't contribute and in does change yearly but a lot of people can't contribute to a Roth\nIra and that is why you need a financial eggplant act figure all that stuff out for you and for your situation um another thing and this is I guess probably a more personal to me from the standpoint that I have twin boys that are seniors in high school and\nWe're getting ready to send them off to college next fall and I it is mind blowing okay to look at how much it costs to send kids to college these days and there's like that that ratio where you don't want to\nI mean if you can avoid loans you want to avoid loans because who wants to come out with a house payment and no house but at the same time you want to invest in your kids you want them to invest in themselves we've been saving since they were little kids\nUm yeah it is awesome but it's not often enough as it turns out I mean it just it ... it rises so much so much every year that it's like I said it's mindboggling unless you make nothing I mean then\nAnd then it's different than if you know then you're fine but which is also a catch twenty two I ... no matter what it just so out of whack sort of all over the place\nUm so what do you say the parents young parents\nThat are starting out with their kids like ... where do you start when it comes to planning and saving for college\nThat's a really good question and you know one of the things I always related to you is when you're on an airplane and when you're on an airplane a flight attendant always says what they say if something were to happen you put the mask on yourself first and then you put it on your child\nIt's the same thing with financial planning and so often the thing that we think about first as our cats I mean right and it's also the first thing in the timeline right right or going to usually get to college first before we get to retirement so we're always thinking about what can we be saving for them\nBut honestly when I knew my clients if they're not on track for retirement we're going to work on that because we can't take out a loan for retirement but we could\nFor college you can sort of idea now we don't really want to you you know but so we have to really each each person so that makes sense so different so we really got a dive in to figure out what are their goals are they tracking to retirement we need to make sure that they're on track first because we you know can't take a lot of I don't know for that um but also I mean\nIt kind of goes back to the same thing we talked about earlier as something on Sunday says now versus later is so huge if we can start to create that Tom punting effect for their college but again you know when we're planning and we continue to come back and look at this plan\nEvery six months so we're always on top of people's planning we just continue to look at that we're going to look at 'em you know ... where are we tracking for the college but also what's cash flow look like meaning could you pay for some of this college out of your budget\nCannot interrupt the compound in that's happening in your planning ouch yeah that would hurt but you could make you do it so often people forget what they need to be paid for daycare or what can they be paid for\nYeah private school or sports are all these sort of things leading up\nYou know private school or sports are all these sort of things leading up to it um and so we do look at that as an option okay well what's your budget look like you know can you cash flow college and keep your money growing income pounding within your planning for maybe do half and half ... yeah and ultimately\nIf you could max out of five twenty nine plan and max out your retirement plan and all of those things are moving in the right direction\nWhat is a maximum of five twenty ... well first of all state would have five twenty nine planets\nIt's a college education um program that you can put in you know specifically and actually now you can use it for um private school as well you know who can yeah yeah so it you know there's that opportunity to put into it and then literally just\nTake it and we saw that on our kids were babies but I also that's changed that I Know that\nThe ... I mean it's definitely and an opportunity for people to have as a piece of their plan but there's so much like I always go back to your to really know somebody's true goals and what their situation is and what makes the most sense for thirty dollars\nSo there's no tax on that when you pull that out right okay and so from there I guess are there other vehicles besides the five twenty nine or just regular savings plan or something like that that you\nAre committed hands I mean you could you could contribute to so many different things and um you know take from that for the purpose of college I mean even I mean again depending on how you're designing it and structuring it a well designed\nI'm well funded permanent life insurance policy it's you have access to it at any time you're not handcuffed to the fifty nine and a half age barrier that you are within like a four O. one K. or IRA you know you could borrow from there and pay yourself back you know as well\n... but then what if you okay this is morbid but what if he died in the middle of that the policies still pay out yeah\nAbsolutely you would just subtract or whatever you had you know borrowed um from your plan and the death benefit then goes to your beneficiaries\nSee this is again right I'm going to say it again why we need a financial planner this is Alicia McMahon from northwestern mutual um and they can reach you at your office at three one four to four four\nZero seven to four or they can reach you on line at Alicia McMahon dot com north western mutual your office is increased core um and so All right so we've covered\nAh the kid does and kind of what the plan is air that you're supposed to put on your oxygen mask first right um and I get that but that's that's hard to think of as a pair\nOf hard yeah we can always are putting our kids first I mean really I mean with with everything we're always thinking that way um but ultimately you know it makes sense to look at it as a whole and how your dollars are going to be most effective yeah um\nWell let's think about it I mean you don't want to be I mean if you're not doing well and your kids are going to be doing well swimming right and so it can\nStrike all I mean the next thing you know they're taking care of you in retirement you know because you didn't save enough you know there's so many butts\nToo darn bad [laughter] I like that and I'm not going to hit I that's why I like that we should pursue ... mushroom hunger and bad [laughter] yeah absolutely so\nAll right so when you when you have the opportunity at your workplace like what are some of the things are there are other things besides the four o one K I mean obviously that you can do or something you can do on your own or with you as a financial planner um that have these cute little names or\nAnd ... and a lot of the guys is somebody that I've been I've been mired from the day I met him ... years and years ago bill Cybil introduced me doing was Gary limits you
