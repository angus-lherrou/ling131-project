tomorrow give them a call\nYou won't be disappointed joined here on the bus you wrap up show with tiger assistant and defensive line coach Rick Haley I Know that you have to work against them in practice so you can speak a little bit about the offensive line the way that they performed today\nTo get everybody rolling on the right page one you needed to have big runs you got them we ... really didn't matter those guys go on the ground for two hundred and Seventy three yards and really take the steam out of Memphis the defense I think of the game or a law\n[noise] yeah I think a dolphins and wanted a really great job we go against them every day in practice uh [noise]\nYou know ... not a really really good job with those guys and I'm really clicking on all cylinders up front um you know you you look at those guys and they and they are they give you everything that they got nothing [laughter] suffer us sometimes in practice to get off blocks in the ... things up on them so they've done a really really good job [noise]\nHow have they prepared you for what is to come and what you've already seen this season 'cause you mentioned there are some unique challenges I think facing up against the line that's a lot of rich earners in a lot of experience\nWhile they were the biggest thing is that they give us a fastball pitcher that gives us that we can't get to our look teams and things like that and\nThis to the fastball pitcher the physical now so that a ... they're really done a great job with the move and taking care of each other to end up staying off the ground and that's really big for him for all of us and I think the times that we do get to go against them in day out and just makes us that much better and give them an opportunity to be better\nI Know that we mentioned Kentucky a little bit the Wildcats are an actor and right now and they were down in her early touched down to Vanderbilt but it's a similar type of look at least one you see 'em on paper as far as I've seen in terms of what bending now can do you have a feature back they really liked to pound the ball do you feel that this week of preparation to Memphis translates well to the week of preparation for Kentucky\nI think it does you know I had a long time to look at Kentucky right off but no one what we know just like you did\nThey had a long time to look at Kentucky right off but\nOne what we know just like you did with ... and those guys I think it is going to kind of matchup force in what we need to do is do a better job of um taking care of responsibilities in her gaps and doing a little things to\nHelp us be able to stop the wrong so we got to do that and come back and make sure that we're cleaning those things up for this week but I think we would have a little bit of a job because of the things that we saw incidents that\nYou know what the time that you spent in this league and not just Europe Missouri that time of year were coaches sometimes say All right if you're a freshman it's time for you to start playing like a sophomore sophomore it's time for you to take that next leap forward as well I think when we heard earlier what Jay ... Knox is doing right now with some of your other young or and\nLeft her experience players are doing the really settling into rules and when you solidify that at this time of year special things can happen\nNo question that's a really funny that you say that because that's exactly the message I Love what my guys before I left the locker room you know\nEverybody's got to start playing like they're seniors everybody's got to start playing like their leaders everybody's got to come in and put it into work like it's a lot of times they're going to ever play the game so um you know I think you're exactly right is this time of year that done teams\nLeaders continue to get better or stay the same and what we want to do is want to try to continue to get better so we're going to keep pushing it a day to day and you know the freshman part of it is over his son to go to work and\nLet's go make plays there was no more pressing mistakes there's everything we're going to do now focused on trying to get us where we need to be when some ballgames\nTalk about your life position a little bit defensive line position you got back or junior of course we know about him that the senior of another defensive tackle Walter power and other senior then you go young\nYou got a lot of sophomores in that room let's talk about those young guys or we can expect out of them all\nThe young guys have done a good job right now so far ah you know Jordan now is really really good job force Coby ... white side of the really good job for those guys that continue getting better every week every you know we just got to keep them focused and locked in and make them understand was always the next man up\nThe big thing for us is that we do um\nPlay a lot of guys inside and the little guys that had an opportunity to get some quality reps in quality minutes to help us get better up front so when those seniors do disappeared you know hopefully that we won't have any drop off what\nDo you like about coaching his group every day when you show up at that meeting room [laughter] what what what makes your your clock tick what do you like about um well\nI think the biggest thing is that they come in Hungary and ready to go up you know sometimes you got to push them and brought him some places but I'll tell you these guys have been great I've been really really happy with the way they responded um you know\nThe things I can do a lot of times it's tough\nAnd when I got to do with I got to make sure that they understand that even though it's tough it's going to be better for us then that sort of what it's all about at the end of the day we got to they talk about technique some fundamental cycle job about this when we look don't do this\nHousing when you get a few more years and you can tell me what we want to do but right now is is going to do it they're really good at it and they do the things that we're not\nThe interest in that ... maybe it's I Know that they want to be self motivated now in the last you know you have to tell them all the time and you want to keep 'em on track but the same time you can use that energy do a positive towards the end of the season\nNo question I think that's something that uh we Rodolfo last year for the interview those guys and we got to get that same energy back and continue to push forward or think they are ready to do that hopefully we can take the next step and continue to grow and get better as a unit\nIt's all it is a very happy homecoming night in Columbia, Missouri tonight after sixty five thirty three when three ...\nFive tackles for

A. I. A. for me having lock me in a position where he looked comfortable again where he was really delivering the football again this was reminiscent of some of his earlier games on furlough field besieging hey it's the talk run when you're going against Georgia and then on the road in a monsoon and then again the Alabama Crimson Tide\nWell Torres hall you're leading tackling tied with Gail Garrett today eleven tackles eight on his own got attacked a couple of tackled for lost to quarterback curries a player like that if you're an offensive lineman argue that under your breath anytime you seen them lined up or change your gap on a list because he was everywhere today\nYeah he he's a player that the offensive line and an offensive coordinators in general a draw a circle around here we've got to figure out a beat this guy no or he's lying up every play by play against some great line backers of my day and you know it's just a chess match you got to try and figure out when they're bluffing on a blitz and are not want to make the wrong call protections and\nGot to get those guys picked up and make sure you block them well and um I liked blocking those guys a lot when they come fast because ah\nThe Cumberland downhill and your chopped their needs help from underneath and become a little slower next time so there's definitely some tricks fools guys down but a good film study be able to pick out their tendencies and figure out when they're going to come and we're at\nA pose the question to coach Haley and I will ask you as well about how Missouri's offensive line performed today you know we you look at some of the big\nTouchdown runs and he'd say okay at the end of it you need to have you know just to individual talent from a running back but I saw consistently at the point of attack and the areas in which Missouri wanted to run the ball for the most part that was open and that goes to the five up front all the time\nWell you you just want to take care of your dad Lima and if you can get you running backs second level and make then and then build them is the guy\nThat was going to be a successful play and for the most part we got the job done all at one time I can take back our little disappointed was when we go three and out um after Memphis pulls a within four or something like that would go through it out\nAnd go quick count and a third one we don't pick up the first now that play that's the only thing I could look back on and say man I Wish they would have done a better job there at a time when momentum needed a change back to\nMissouri tiger side how much the only thing I saw that really was man I Wish we could have done better there but for the most part of a good game kept clean a made some good choice thrown out of pocket throwing the ball away\nUm the ... up lately open they can get healed up for this next game against Kentucky because it's going to be a dog fight\nYeah I think the one you're thinking of was after Memphis had gotten their field goal to open their scoring a Twenty one to three Missouri had a quick thirty one and they tried to run off the left side and stuff they got blown up at the point of attack\nAnd that led to the sequence of events where Memphis\nEventually did find themselves within four points and I thought and you've been in situations where you had to say OK let's cut it out do enough and you alluded to this earlier\nBut what Missouri did to kind of take themselves out of the stall and get back on course on both sides of the ball after Memphis has got nickloes was really impressive because once they found that read them again and boom it was off once again and then we're not going to be caught\nOr just the the penalties really take teams out of rhythm and we had a lot of penalties during that time over the Memphis back in the football game and\nYou go to the defense could have gotten off the field Memphis are going to have to pause from around the thirty five forty yard line [noise]\nUm it would have given us pretty good feel positioning thing would have been kicking into the wind and we get the rough and the pastor called Fifteen yards fresh cut down\nIn Memphis goes against their field goal and then it was just kind of downhill from there until they got within four and then it was like our guys said okay we've been here before this year or we gotta do to overcome this and that was when they drew the line at the end of it was nice to be overcome\nOne of the leaders of the team one of the leaders of the offensive line is Kevin ... Denise stood up last week after the Alabama game and said hey dumping all this on July we got stuff we can do up front better do and they certainly did this afternoon and they sixty five thirty three

S. pink T shirt I'm Glad you mentioned that\nAnd AT T shirts basically we are giving them away to listeners all you have to do on social media on Facebook Twitter or Instagram share a picture of you in pink\nAnd tagging with hash tag Kate T. R. S. pink and we're picking fifty people to give the T shirts to when they can come up to the station and pick them up\nOh that's great I Love that and it's really about raising awareness so if it reminds one woman out there\nTo make the appointment to get the mammogram than the whole thing is worth it absolutely yes I agree as we know early detection is key when it comes to breast cancer and\nYou've got to take the time to make the appointment for yourself we all know somebody that's been through it we know young women that have been through it that they don't even have a family history of it so we all need to get checked it's so very important and that's why\nWe're doing this and thanks to our sponsors that\nHave made this possible to do K terrorists hash tag ... here on the big five fifty So Daniel I Want to introduce people I'm a little bit more because you are an interesting character my friend [laughter] you've got a lot going on your blogging you're ... you're\nTwittering your Instagram and you're Facebooking and you're a social media guru I guess I don't know how else to say it\nWhile I'm I'm not worthy [laughter] I think you are actually yeah so basically to make a long story short how I got into social media and blogging\nIs I'm In twenty ten I lost my job I was actually working in a chart that's my trade is in human resources and I was laid off\nAnd about three or four months before I was laid off I started the cubicle chick dot com as a way to share a chart tips because a lot of people would ask me advice on resumes and had a\nGood uh give a good interview and just different things like that and I thought I Need a website to be able to share this expertise well then I got laid off and I started looking at\nPeople like parades Hilton who had a gossip blog and other bloggers were able to monetize able to make money and I thought well maybe I can turn this hobby into a job be\nSo [laughter] I don't know how I looked at it and so I just started to network around St Louis with brands and with other bloggers or did you live and um and then I started to uh get national campaigns and I started to go to blogging conferences\nAnd I started to really get into the nuts and bolts of how to grow your Facebook and Twitter Instagram wasn't even a thing when I first started there was no such thing as Instagram\nAnd it just became a job for me\nAnd for eight years until ... terrorists I have been totally self employed totally taking care of my family with the income I made from the cubicle chick but\nMy son got older graduated moved to LA and then my daughter now is a freshman in high school and I was like you know what it would be kinda interesting to get back into the job market I loved the cubicle chick dot com I Love growing it that's not going anywhere\nBut you know my kids are older now let me see what's out there and I saw that there was a social media position here at the big five fifty which is only like five minutes from my house which is like a win well yeah that is a well when when and ah you know a month later I was hired so and\nHere she is the best dressed woman in the building I'm reading now I'm ... and her you know if my hair and a ponytail and my genes on and she's always decked out in cute so okay I Love this that you hear you were in a position that was\nA position that no one wants to be and when you get laid off from a job but you took the lemons and made it into lemonade and really started something and to be able to support your family by doing that you're a social media influence or can you explain to people kind of how you did that and how you have\nSo many followers and how that grows because I find it interesting for people listening that have a business or that have something to say something to share and I think people would like to know how do you grow it\nSure well from starting point people buy from who they know who they like and who they trust so social media is a wonderful avenue for every day Joes and joins like myself to be noble likeable and trust of all and so when I say\nOh I went to see this movie it was great I'm noble and likeable and troubles so people will go see the movie and so that's what influence it's all about it's all about taking your experiences with products and services and things and turning it into a story that resonates with people\nAnd there's really no magical way to grow it people even like you or they don't but if you are likeable if you are honest if you are real people will gravitate towards you and the ... but the most important thing is to be consistent\nThere are people that are on social media and they're like well I've been on here for two years\nWhy don't I have a good feeling and followers are not consistent you might post once a day for two weeks and then we don't see your friend she's my he had to do it every single day I have to do it every day and you have to be consistent not only with what you're posting but she'll messaging you can't\nBe all over the place and so I have a lot of working moms who follow me I Am a career and working mom lifestyle blogger so a lot of my content revolves around that and I've been able to build a following because I Know the needs of working moms because I Am one and I'm able to share that with them\nDanielle did you go to some kind of schooling or did you take any like social media classes because I've heard of these classes before and\nAt one time whenever I was first getting out of school for a few people recommended\nAt one time whenever I was first getting out of school for a few people recommended hated men are her to go take some classes tried to just kind of get an idea of what works on social media so did you take part in a news classes\nNo I didn't ... I guess you could call it on the job training I learned as I go but I Will tell you that I invested a lot of money in social media and blogging conferences the very first blocking conference I went to\nI was so broke it was at the very beginning of my blogging I really couldn't even attempt to afford to attend but I like pulled all the strings to go it was in D.C which is a pretty expensive yeah that's a that's not a cheap trick no and so there was five of us in the room\nGuys women in a small D.C hotel room right hope to God it's women you knew it was ... oh that's good but it's great because eight years later I can like go\nAfford to go to blocking conferences and pay my way on your own and on my own and not have any room and you can do like snowing in the bed and I said yeah the growth is good but I say all that to say I invested in social media conferences and and a lot of these conferences Facebook they'll ... they'll send a Facebook person\nThey'll send him now and Instagram person and so they tell you things they teach you things on these conferences I was just on social media crews um about a month ago for five days and there were experts they're talking about different things to talk about ... talking about how to grow your YouTube channel talking about all these things\nAnd so no I don't have a degree in social media haven't taken any classes\nBut I've worked really hard and you can teach the class I think I think so I\nTake too many pictures you can oh I got to do this on Instagram I got to do this on Twitter I got to do this on Facebook Like you can do that and messes up the experience for for yourself so you got you got to have those checks and balances and place\nSometimes my husband and I sit down to watch a movie you know or watch a show together just to spend some time to get together and he'll say can you please put your phone down just for a little while and it's like oh sorry my bad like I Know it's bad but I Can't help but it's like a pacifier like when you go to bed at night I was to look at your screen\nI wake up in the middle of the night a look at my screen is like a real situation\nBut if you're like oh if you're like myself are sometimes I use my phone as a way to almost socialize with Whitney by my fiance a you know often did you see this like about somebody that we know or did you see this news story can you believe such and such happened and I mean it's always like a way of trying to ignore the persons that it's almost like a way of showing them they're just see what happened\nBut I'm One of my big questions for you and I've heard people mentioned this before although it kinda sounds like you're on all of them\nBut is there whenever you're in social media\nIs it wise to be on one platform mainly and then the other ones are kind of like your secondaries 'cause like some celebrities there wildly famous on Instagram for example but then on Facebook they may have like one for the amount of followers are likes is the truth to that or do you recommend trying to be even on all of those for media platforms\nNo I Do not recommend to try to be even\nEach platform offers a different experience for the user and for the end user\nSo I tell people to pick to platforms because they're really strong on\nBe on all platforms because number one you want to make sure you have to name you don't want anybody else to like take your name on a platform so it'll be on everything but pick two of them that you will use daily you will engage and connect with a and and use regularly and those are your talk to you and you put the same content on both things\nSo I'm not a fan of that or if you do when I get so when I put a picture up on Instagram\nI Will have a different caption or different feel\nWhen I put it up on Facebook does that yeah I don't just put\nIt up on everything and put the same ... same you know because each audience is different so on Instagram it's more of a storytelling device so you you more want to tell a story and ask questions it's like what Snapchat used to be here and get people to engage on Twitter it's got to be quick\nConcise because you only have now you have what ... I think it's two fifty now to some things are going to be one forties so and then on and on Facebook you can even be even longer because there's really no limits so well\nYou know what though sometimes you have to give us a T L DR which means too long didn't read\n[laughter] you you pick too strong ones that you're going to use 'em we all have a favorite everyone you know most people right now in ... it's hot it's hot thing right now Instagram is super duper hot\nBut I tell people for me it's Twitter I was able to grow my business in my following on Twitter Twitter is a\nI've had show producers from CNN from TMZ that's how I got an TMZ they yeah they found me on Twitter 'cause people search you search the hashtags on Twitter oh a lot of uh producers and shows they use that as a search and and so you want to eat what is it do for you\nWhat is late day came to you and said what they came to me I because\nYou what is late day came to you and said what\nThey came to me because I use a particular ... do you want to talk about this on the segment and I'm like yeah 'cause then you're on your he ... he was on TMZ I totally excited [laughter]\nI don't know this was like two years ago and you know they only keep so many clips up but I've been on there I've been on a chilling up and I was on CNN that was my first ever big thing you remember the movie the blind side that Michael or yet yeah so I tweeted about seeing the movie\nAnd I've seen in producer was like would you like to come on and talk about your thoughts of the movie I read your tweets and I thought she was punky me I was like to know what you're seeing in producer\nAnd so she said damn man I Will um direct message me and I'll give you my number and we can talk about it we talked about it she was like this is what I Want to discuss our ... are you comfortable doing it we did a Skype\nAnd then I was also on their website that would not have happened if I wasn't on Twitter so I think that there's value really a way\nTo reach out to people and to get involved in the things that interest you and I think that that that's you know kind of the key because you are probably genuinely interested in seeing the movie genuine thoughts about the movie and that's how it works it doesn't work when you're trying to be something that you're not\nSo correct me if I'm wrong or right or wrong I figured by bells [laughter]\nIt's very them a little trouble and girl talk every week and now I'm a doctor radio but I don't know a lot of things but I really do feel like I should know more about social media because I was young but okay so my impression of it is in ... I'm kinda like where you sort of cover the story telling more of a picture basing\nTwitter's more newsy wouldn't use that Facebook is more so kind of like a family sort of a\nCause I I live on Facebook Like Whitney my fiance she's on Twitter constantly I mean she she kind of like you know my\nNieces say that the that the parents took over Facebook [laughter] yeah\nLike my daughter the other day she was like no one's on Facebook and I'm like girl girls ... people are on Facebook than any other part down through but I ... the younger generation like my son he's he's\nA twenty four he'll be twenty five next year and he's all Instagram he's on he's on Facebook only to connect with like past high school people and family yeah he's not really on their\nYou know sharing as much as he is on Instagram so Instagram to me it's like\nThe millennial um or the ... um or the fashionable mom or you know the you know what we call yummy mommies [laughter]\nAnd I got a little spice girls um is that that's what that's worth but you know what you can make the platform fit you right\nYes there are different limitations yes there are things that people certain people do on each platform but make the platform yours use it to your advantage and use it the way that you want to use it\nSo we are talking today to Danielle little who is a blogger a vulgar or social media influence or she works here at the big five fifty Katie are as remember to put those pictures up\nAnd use hash tag ...
