vice president for St Louis actually Germany alibi Jeremy good evening sir how are you\nGoing well\nCongratulations on the playoff berth gains is weak and trying to kind of walk us through your emotions on Saturday or during a zero zero draw you guys needed that point and you picked it up\nYeah I mean are they for getting that went on a Wednesday was was mad at her and then we take care of business on Thursday getting the point or I'm Sorry and Saturday\nYou know getting a point there are that we manage the game while I'm good what we need to do ... you know didn't get stretched created a few chance or\nYou know I think one of those cancers early on goes in a different it's a different game and and we play to win I mean we wanted to get 'em you know three more points but ah\nI mean I think you see the emotion just from a fan of them and the players and stuff it was a long time coming and well deserved by this group so or you know excited to see what we can do here uh you know in the oil\nJeremy was the ... was the reaction by\nThe fans and ... and by yourself and and everybody else there\nI'm In the organization is ... was it was it all you bought it it could be like you said a a a so much hard work went into this to to get to this point did did you did it feel like you thought it would feel when when you guys are crossed the finish line\nYeah for sure or manger or you know the monkey off the back of this but really for getting that done you know we felt that we've had a team this year that could do it and you know when I was scared in the middle of the season\nYou start to question a few things but you're you stay true to yourself and your guts and your instinctive you know the guy that we brought in our locker room and obviously they persevere\nThey persevere through some tough times but yeah the emotions were were ... when I'm actually a few things fun at the park I'm\nSorry [laughter] but\nUm you know just a everybody that's put so much into it from you know fans that have been what that since day one to you know people that have really attached to this group of players to um you know ticket guys and you know and just to see the the relief and excitement on everybody's space um because it was well preserved by the team\nWhat do you think for you Jeremy what was the moment where you felt like this thing turned in the right direction after like you said maybe ... some some struggles in the middle of the year\nYou know it's it's so hard to point a to one moment I mean you've got to look at things go on Reno where they were on a sixteen game\nOn beating strength can and Sam scores that gold late I think that really got some belief and um some excitement that we could you know play um you know you go back to early in the seat and when we played so well against the monarchs shore and first play out at the time and we played really really well but you know unfortunate on a penalty call\n'em and we'd battled the big boys all year and yet we hooked up against Vegas and you know we we slipped up at home and get large easy but when we have to play the big dogs we we ran with them and um you know just do a lot of little moments that you could point to 'em and I think that's\nYou know I think to find a good team that they were a lot of those and not just one tipping point\nI I I Know German you guys had the eight seed but does it do you like to you the western conference is wide open that these teams one through wait are a lot a lot more tightly packed in one through weight\nIt does it does and I think um you know you have to respect everybody and you you you know you can't say oh we want to avoid this team I Want to avoid that and you have to take whoever is thrown your way in the playoffs but you you're spot on I feel it's a it's a tightly contested\nUm conference and it looked at that mean that there couldn't be some you know a lopsided games or something that could happen here in the first round because you know it's one game and you have to win so if you're down a goal early\nTo open up to try to get one and then obviously can get another one or you know it's just there could be a lot of things that are going to happen but um you know I think you can throw the seeds out the window I think it's ah everybody gets to get the chance to to go head to head and you know that's what we're looking forward to

M. V. paid it off ... and ... maybe a couple of I mean let let's throw out some contenders than seemed as some guy that certainly would be up for it and then ultimately\n... so four surprise of the year I'll throw ... and there's water yep absolutely because he came on honorable mention a couple of our missions were MVP\nA MVP so I think you have to look at power Gregory would look at three guys that you have to look at Cal Greg you'd think you have to look at wall fall and\nI Wonder if John Reynolds is is in there after the year that he put in the time that he put in 'em but walling Kyle for sure I think half to have to be in that in that discussion\nAnd and you'll and you would go to give it to cover egg\nTo have to be in that in that discussion\nAnd and you'll and you would ultimately give it to ...\nYeah sixteen goals or whatever he's got a and and having a front or a line of for good front players which means he doesn't play every minute of every game which some of the from players do in this league um yeah there's sixteen goals are phenomena\nHow many times have we send in this room Dale man of the match ... ... and ... yeah exactly it it was a it was like clockwork\nUm before I get your keys and I'm actually a let's look at this match he said why do you believe this is all of this and everyone said oh St Louis but why do you feel like this is a a a match up that I Would not say favors St Louis actually but a match up that they can handle\nLet's look at why but sort of the four teams just briefly OC blues Sacramento Phoenix ... those are the four teams vying for the the top spots in the conference\nThe two teams you don't want to play or Phoenix and ... even though their third and fourth place in in a conference in my mind\n[noise] athletically it's hard to match up with them the quality of their players it's hard to match up with them they are\nThey are individually outstanding both of those teams they've gone through some issues with coaching changes which are hurt them but on any given moment on any given night those two teams are talented enough to be anybody in either conference\nSo you can't hardly match up to it I think one of Anthony's strengths is his ability to read the strengths and weaknesses of the other team come up with a game plan as to how he's going to exploit the weaknesses and knock it hurt by their strengths and um and then you know create that game plan and and communicated to see\nYou can game plan Phoenix how do you how do you deal with drug but as a U.S all player you you can't deal with you can't come up with a game plan is how you're going to deal with drier the three said there was a three seed and monitor the fourth seat now the Sacramento I think we matched up with and I said that earlier in the year I\nThink we've match up with him but they'd gone on like a seven game or Iran or on beating streak so they're they're playing well in their hot right now Orange County we've had two good results a one on draw to to draw we match up with them favorably both teams are about organization and\nSystems it's easier for Anthony to set up the system and a game plan to to compete against Orange County than it is re out or Phoenix and Sacramento's on a good run so I say\nPolicy blues a good match up however they're very good a lot of experience five or six Emma less eczema less players and the roster\nEight professionals are not professional though there are played top flight football um they're uh they're good team but I think we can match up all\nThe all let's look at your three keys to the match for Saturday Night at nine o'clock kick from out you know see let's start with your first the\nFirst key is I'm dealing with transition where do we lose the most of the games in this leader one on mistakes by the opposition and then transitioning and opportunities where do you lose the ball or if\nIt were losing the ball in the middle of the field or the back to the fewer OC is facing the goal and they can get on the break we're going to be in big trouble because Michael seat and it's the center for who can run ... has twenty goals may be Twenty one goals who the wide left guy\nWho's played for Denmark World Cup Timmy played in the world cup and two thousand ten\nSo he's he's got high quality um and uh so they've got guys that can that can score goals if we lose the ball and bad spots in the field\nThan they are going to run at us and and really cause a cause some problems farce is and the same for them were good defensively if they lose the ball and bad spots for them we we have the ability to score goals against them\nSecond key Dale second key\nSo they're very organized they'll play they'll drop back into their own half of the field of play a line of four and another line of foreign between those two lines so put one central material player between those two lines and clog up\n... located in one forty one and all of\nBig is the home of Missouri Tigers [noise] those big

the kind of goes along with it if you remember in ... or do you know for the memory of Josh\nYeah so we are what we typically do is I mean obviously\nWe try to start as early as possible and say as late as possible but um as you mentioned the sec Daniel tailgate for Josh so this weekend against Memphis\nBy the time that we have fought it as a guest game time to three so we'll start around noon on typically end up um a little after ... after the game so it's probably Noone to seven typically what we'll do is is all you can eat all you can drink a thirty dollars per person or the people that we have doing the food\nAre phenomenal on the barbecue so we did we do have wings burgers pulled pork French fries and I typically don't have some sort of a some sort of desert like fried dough and if there's something that are pretty good um so we are a lot\nAnd that is right next to the softball stadium it's you're familiar with the new south Boston or with a new stadium there and we we we have a really good crowd that shows up for it I'm obviously we send out\nA lot of uh information on social media primarily on Facebook but typically get a really good crowd\nAnd or just a cheer on the tigers have we have probably five or six parking spots so it's a pretty big you can't miss it will have some new flags and\nThe Atlantic ten conference you mentioned are rebounding ... aspect\nOf this early and and the guy that uh it it seemed like his workouts during the summer and were were things of a legend in now as as we venture into practice cardiac Gordon\nHow much you have you gotten to see of his practices with the building and they die machines really starting to turn up on him it is a is you're going to live up to it\nSo he's a very valid but just bad I think it was a size ... two hundred and forty pounds without that he's not the poodle low poll which is very good around the\nCorner evaluating how could handle the ball on the forever they're getting a pass the ball and give from person to lead it for a kid that size that you know usually don't see it I got kicked like that a lot of parents who got a lot of good ...\n... am pleased with the big old ... mind kid who can do a lot of things\nWith the basketball then you add up to what we already have\nThat what makes it very exciting uh um I Can't wait to see about they're a little on the phone call you know what I was fired up right away at a real good fresh can prevent the danger for men and men are well worth back you know so he asked who we ask you I think it's a pretty good for\nYou know early you mentioned you know the type of for a dense Ankara down there in the blocks right under the basket how important is it in two days basketball to have to have a a a real in sort of an eclectic group of big big that are down there in the botched things that are going to\nYou know shock blind big that would be that can then that can also run the floor bringing up shoot this three is it important to have a blend of those guys because we hear all this stuff about his decision\nPosition list basketball a critical then is it to have that blend of big\nTicket very important that said you know even at that because if it's becoming more and more the recovered more and more ah you know\nTo the left the pro level they're praying for three by the college level\nGot some very who can really deal around that basket could fail got a lot of things like North Carolina who want to prepare for a year ago or ... years ago at the airport in that thing worked for a local political fail the guy who thought there were no but the\nVery first of all the cooking end up with a delegation pouring through a lot of basketball if\nAt all and got guys that can go out guard up picking a role\nYou know without the ... film small out of bed and I found for it so so you can do the cardio got political athletic can move here well murky really should have the basketball for a new kind of a threat five and that opens up or you know when he's out there since ...\nThings up for like Jordan and cook within five\nClasses for the basket as well though if it's a very good I liked the I like to collect so that's why I got good five or athletic and you know they can do a lot of different things you\nMentioned fringe Earl ... means third team a pre season all Atlantic ten today he's the guy did show you can score around the basket he can rebound he's a shot blocker but how much do you think he's getting these capable of expanding do is capable of being like you said one of those words that can do a lot of different things\nYeah I think uh what what are lacking here you know we we started off\nOn a lot of low poll on any strong and he's good with his right and even though we're very proud of the crowd was bought out on the high poll liquor every ... could have acted as well and create stuff officer or five fifty I miss raschke would've vicar for Iran playful hard and he's one of the better luck wherever blocker free\nBrought up playful hard and he's one of the better ... Scott Walker Freeman college basketball you go for a kid on the court reviled really winning anger that clean inside what can you really got going last season so I'm looking for a lot of this whole mess with comes with the barrier\nFor last a junior with this year in the big five fifty ... early guy that I guess just started practicing hears the Maryland transfer Dionne why only and and we talked to a trend is over the summer she was you know he was speaking of green real glowing terms about dance about the type of off into deem she can bring you stink keys\nOr is he the type a guard that can be more than just three point specialists ...\nKind of sneak up on us and maybe be a double digit a game score for anything\nEven more the free point type further\nOn that when like five kids you know when you file pay the teachers are a little pop on that poor ever there are a lot in that poll wherever there I think that's the main thing you're trying to help you on a consistent basis if that's the case with five I think you can give you that you know I commend it would go probably more the better\nYou know as far as a a\nCraft or from track for twenty year old guy up there for free but you can get put a basket or even one of those guys and you know lake\nLake locked away for like ... breaks down and go even go and get your one and that's what that's one thing\nWe were kind of lacking and feels trapped by the lake\nAnd I think that for a really kind of wrapped up into moving up to a patient of the season even more you know we still have pretty good guard coming back but then you find out if you're single average corner you have to be one level ... who kind of ... what would they were in there that they want to pay to go get a basket\nThat kind of a kind of a you know their patrons a little bit more\nWith with the guard because there's there's so much in the early so much talent in the ... in in in the front court could use these scenario we're we're transitioning maybe sometimes go small and has won in somewhere where you could go like a bass widely booed when he used to build a five on the floor\nBecause you know a lot of different things like you said you can play like a critic of that because of ... or ... or ... in the paper\nAnd Jordan in their ... or ... or you can play a big believer for though like what Carty air a and a frog French\nFries as well with ... play the free and you know you can go a lot of different for extra step out through the guardian if if it if you know depending on what the hell you wrap it up with a different ... back up with new I think that's one thing whatever qualities of birth little guys\nAt different sizes and versatility that gives you a lot of different options for may prove a\nYou know kind of exciting for it to play with what\nWhat ultimately what kind of play or do you think Jordan good news right now Earl because\nHe's shooting improve do we got off to a slow start last year when the shooting really improved a by the time you just season ended when he showed you know triple double type of skills and you mentioned that a couple of days ago that he wouldn't mind you know putting up those triple double caliber numbers every night but you also see him\nAs it guided ill we change the ball in his hands in\nAnd did you see him as sort of the features score because again these skills that appears to be limitless\nYeah I mean you may not be able to\nScore a festival a stepfather bass is though but I think if you don't get to double digits and did it that a lot of different ways that\nFor our dog he plays evidence of this was about you know you play like a bad place to travel on the market for mark who with our way out and about what the Boston Celtics can point point quite a prude green\nYou handle the ball he's comfortable with the ball and an advocate for voters rebounded offensively disrupt that's probably where he's at its best way to resolve it offensively with afflictions and it really really appalled al ...\nAnd they're you know up and put them on a credit score\nWith George is like that throughout the fourth I'll pop so it's just we just put Jordan on the court said guided him that he was first triple double bill ... is free flooded with court or the other is that I can do for many other things for a fan of the career with\nOprah quelled dominated the day that we're going to believe that carbon ... from the field for the I like about five but for the hills and was the voice and you forgot you probably have to work through the night of his life because of all the fat he told me the other things with a trivia cruel when I get a good theme\nWas one guy and we have we don't hear as much about because we're I mean everybody is is obviously rightfully so so enamored with hardy Gordon to do but you know friend latch and as a freshman coming on and his team or what kind of role do you think he has obviously the uh\nThe credentials are they're coming from John in psych student he was a big time recruiter your instinct but but what what kind of rule do you think he has run away\nThey were into their confidence that I've been traveling covered with players have recruited the flu shot in Jordan good when life about three years ago he loves the rebalancing wealth with a friend he's really improve the junk shot I Know he played in the late there and found it\nReally did a nice job often simply that are on knowing Hummer workouts that he was very impressive than by you know it's you know the kind of battle battle and try to find his way up there for a better against with a look back\nAt the Atlantic tent early before we let you go you know St Joe's picks checking today David Stern George Mason forward it's weird you know the the powers of this legal over the last few years Rhode Island Dayton VCU their pick more in the middle of the pack a day or who who do you think this is ... you didn't get the job is I\nI liked that David ... kid looks like he's getting some all American consideration there might pick to give the toughest challenge\nAnd granted it's got to be a pro before yeah that's a new flu I got him from Michigan ballot for them to get a college material up he was very smooth the Rhode Island they knew what they've been standby but they've gone for coaching change right\nTo say this is what's surprising you don't see it this time of year but he has a special situation of circumstance with an injury he doesn't know if he's going to be able to come back so he's moving out to the next\nTo I'm going to assume and given the benefit of the doubt that he really wasn't expecting to come back\nMaybe that's the wrong assumption but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt\nSome might say the wheels have come off for the Auburn tires Tennessee rockets eleven game conference a losing streak last week while limiting Auburn from defending its western division title and leaving the tigers won three\nAnd SEC play during his weekly press conference smiles on fought off any suggestions of replacing quarterback Jared ...\nDespite being near the bottom of most passing categories and the SEC still miles on suggested that there will be changes\nYou know I think for the most part of our plans of men [noise] we've is said and ah [noise] you know for whatever reason to be able to execute\nEspecially in certain situations where they are better job of that you know we've been close close enough is enough and we got to figure out whether you're with at home and uh we just got to get through this I mean the bottom line to get through to get back on track went to\nA lot of I think ridiculous rumors are out there about ... miles on future but we are dealing with it once again his future\nWhale is maybe ridiculous because the buyout it's so outrageous over thirty million but you look at Auburn and this was a pre season national championship contenders picked by many in the top ten\nNow looking at maybe not have been making a bowl game is over ... mouse looming large just for their bowl out you know things got really bad with the coach sometimes we get our law says that's a lot of money to pay off somebody then a lot of money to have to go find somebody that you think is better so yeah I don't know for Nicholas was the right term but if he goes five and seven\nWatch out is it fair to be pointing the finger at stood on the quarterback that he's not played well this year and I think you'll be the first to admit that but it's not just that um there's a lot of problems everybody's seen it up front and we all kinds of planets weren't all begins and all the answers what's getting all the scrutiny thus far\nAnd other quarterback news Alabama's to a ton of law gave Crimson Tide fans a scare when he was slow to get up on a first down slide during a win over Missouri he would not return to the tides thirty nine ten victory but in an interview with ESPN earlier this week so software put away any fears about his health\nI'm fine I'm I'm a lot better actually than I was last week after the Arkansas again [noise] I mean they look bad on the field [noise] um I just read between the kind of but you know we've got some treatment after the game or a lot better are much better\nTaliban will play Tennessee this week the questions mansion to play\nWell for touchdown favorites to a jail and they still are pretty good shape I think I Know that Tennessee beat Auburn last week but it's going to be a tall order to knock off Alabama and then years it'd be good to go and excitement as mentality misses the most important game because it's the next game we're gonna play him if he's read a\nLot of people have that mentality to on the other hand do big picture if it gets hurt worse we're looking at the rest of the season here so I I think it's a question mark but looking into it or based on what I've heard from saving into it sounds like he's going to go and he'll play\nThis always headliner and the Southeastern Conference creatures LSU and Mississippi State tigers fresh off their winter or Georgia or the bulldogs are well rested from awake off there are a lot of similarities between these two which is why ... why the Mississippi said radio network believes the battle comes down to quarterback play\nGreat for me than it is a really good and very weak and now they're arrested and they're going to limit LSU salmon and I'll get 'em off the field\nAnd you know she was very good very the very fast ... you know gave up thirty seven reports for the same for the state to last year in stark will they remember it so they're going to tell you whether you're straight off the field and one of these quarterbacks in order to third down throws\nThat will be you know third and twelve Thirteen Fifteen and perverted and activated immersing the game I think we're ever quarterback play the bass shorter\nSeems like every way we talk about job or oh had its best game for LA she certainly had a great game last week but next year the last time we saw him he was running all over over\nThat's true and it's a battle of the quarterbacks I think and and maybe that's right this is a tough spot do frail issue I think just so emotional the win last week how big it was to get right back in the thick of things and it's pretty good team Mississippi State you get that off weight looming frail issue and everybody's looking Alabama already\nBe careful mentioned we stay late new country scored the parents are going to be tough to beat me really embarrassed I let you last year\nThere are several key games across the country including what could be the final true test for the clubs and tigers and the ACC when they host undefeated North Carolina state former Clemson head coach Tommy ... doesn't give it a little fact much of a chance\nThis could be probably a double digit land for Clemson this might be the second best team in the conference but are there significant differences or they can confirm that will be another team or the robbery gang sock on I was always very intense than robbery but clubs don't be a lot more town in South Carolina\nIt's too early to be playing the whatever game when it comes to the play offs but Clemens and quite frankly can't afford to lose a ball game and conference play because these are the only two teams left in the top twenty five we\nWonder about that because the last two seasons they had lost the game of the ACC but they have made the playoff by winning the ACC chance you I'm not sure if it's guaranteed to get in that way this year because they haven't been as impressive overall and at this game here the past two years it's been decided by touchdown\nOne more thing central

aren't\nAnimal welfare me back to the big five fifty capes ers than the freebie shelf\nOur by high school sports caravan on a friday night as we get you ready for a lot of being games around the area a big game tonight up the Parkland or that it's been for a lot of reasons uh Bob on their head coach announced earlier this year that um he was stepping down a long time head coach educator and\nReally a good friend to the high school sports care of myself and why they catch up or bought real quick and Bob first off I Want to say thank you for everything you've done not only for the student athletes and the park with school district but you were one of the first coaches that opens your arms to me Fifteen Years ago when I first started covering the ...\nWell I think I was probably fortunate to meet you and I mean you're doing great work for high school football I've seen a great change with the media and I mean that are in this area since you arrived in next ah [laughter] it's been a great a great run with that as well\nIt's been a great career for you [noise] um yeah a couple of years ago making an outstanding run a great pains which you've had some great kids come through this locker room and he's always hear Parkland or what are some of those highlight that you can maybe think back on you know over your career here at north well\nI mean I I think you you do want to remember the the real good seasons you know the state semi finals and that but\nI think with further you are maybe the older you get and the further you get away you you\nTend to just think of the kids it's this has not been a job this has been just a great great time is a it was something I always wanted to do uh the kids have been wonderful I mean they really have and I think anybody and when you when you don't feel that you're really going to work and you're getting paid for that or it's a bonus and I just\nThink it's been the other relationships with the kids and their families here in the north community that has made it so great\nAnd you know having your family along side of you for a lot of this run you not only coach just ... but then they became assistant coaches with you that's gotta be probably one of the most gratifying things about the whole of your whole career here or\nNo question you know when when I leave here I don't know if Michael will come back he's one of these are all French coordinator what Ross my youngest is Iran's own cameras film or a bowl was the PA announcer and Blake is always there a second guessing me on the sideline along with my dad\nUh keep stats and it has been a family thing my wife's been active in the community and taking care of these boys um\nMy daughter is my my world's biggest critic she's been wonderful uh yeah it's been a a true family um\nType of situation and ah I take the family is maybe a little bit more in a if you will grief than I Am you know I can go on and do other things but this is really been our life you know Friday nights around parkway north football and uh it it will be\nDifferent but talked about the team this year a little bit um you know not to start\nThat you wanted I Know me and you talk to you know during the pre season not not the way you wanted to start things but it really seems like you're that doubted eyes and started playing extremely well over the last three or four\nWeeks [noise] you know what maybe I Am proud of this team\nIn any other because when you're\nOld when three after your first three game we only scored Thirteen points in\nThree games is easy for today's kid to bail and ...\nAre coaching staff has done in my opinion a tremendous job of staying positive with these kids and our kids have been so resilient and we could finish by going for we've had better records after nine wins are nine games but\nThe way we got here\nWe've won some coast games that I think when you win ... games\nYou're you've already had that tall building you're you're playing with confidence we were coming off ... three and one one of the toughest games that we had of the season against central it's all been very proud of these kids are goals to go five and four get another home game and who knows in the district but we're feeling good\nWell that's the thing to their playing\nAt the high level at the right time to get you ready for the districts because after the first three weeks you're thinking oh my gosh we could be buried at the bottom of the district in this district is not an easy district for you guys now you have the opportunity to take care of business tonight against Miller he is or possibly get a home game next\nWeek well that's what we're hoping for and um you know what guy and told the kids I mean we can earn that and ... at what great lessons by staying resilient by staying together which is a big deal to me right or don't tell me your team and you're you know complaining to one another after Owen free that's not a team anybody can\nBe together and when you're winning we have stuck together and we we've gotten a little bit better\nAh I agree I think we are playing or basketball right now a schedule is tough and what I think from a cop on his perspective this is the best we felt practices have been back to fund again I mean it's just a little jumping the kid step and that that's what you want [noise]\nOffensively you mentioned the first three weeks just when it was and clicking but now all of a sudden it is cooking I think a lot of it has to do with that young man running the quarterback position for you as well\nCameras had had a nice career I mean if we just had trouble protecting him and you know come on when you're playing defense is like that and bill and will do in Jackson and andme our cat who's proven to have a real nice team this year we were struggling and we did have a young inexperienced all kinds of wine\nOr I think we've gotten a little better uh we've been able to run the football a little bit more which opens up a past game and camp or or like like he was\nA little bit of a ... year\nHe you know you've got you know at Marquette team they knocked off your ego last week you've got to Fox in Sacramento and three losses between them this is probably the most but I see that I've had covered high school football by Fifteen Years just because you're seeing teams that you don't normally hear doing extremely\nWell well and I double the time that I've been around football from you meaning my answer to that would be those things do run in cycles due to rent it long enough you know who would ever think Webster would be oh in whatever you know there's another example and we know clips of great coach but there's some some years you just don't have\nThat skill um but no I think it's great for the area it's fun seeing in my opinion to Fox in Sacramento in the headlines those guys are paid their news man and you got to be happy for the the programs in the schools because\nLet me tell you just being with three here and we haven't had many of those it's not a lot of hot around school fought around practice and even this team\nRoom but ah no I think it's great I think it's great for ah
