Sunday it was not meant to be and\nIt it it put the cardinals into well into next year ... and there's so much to cover even so much to sort through\nWe're going to get to it but we're going to be doing this all winter ... white where ... where where do you want to start tonight I'm going to I'm going to throw the ball over the ball is at the moment in your court because you've got your whole list to let you know of items as\nAs you know an users may not um I'm On every uh every afternoon for thirty ... so do you have a guy Phillip show and um [noise] we uh we talked I called a requiem for a ball\nTo [laughter] you know where where are you going to go\nAnd I think early on it's all about not not getting the answer is I think it's too soon for the answers get establish what the questions are first and I think we will get to the field stuff first here\nAnd I think we will get to the field stuff first here's a difficult one for me anyway especially since I Know a lot of these guys personally\nBut I I've been removed enough from covering baseball the last couple of years that it's not as sensitive but I think almost everyone would agree that something's going a little bit of rye\nIn talent evaluation not only in not only in trades who to give up who you're getting back free agency who to signing for how much in but also in who are the legitimate prospects\nAnd who can who really can play moving forward and I think we can start to list and I think rather than just this guy's doing great somewhere else we should have kept him it's almost never that easy and\nEach player evaluation probably comes with its own story but if you come up with enough\nBut we got this guy now look he's over there he's playing great if there are enough of those stories you have to start to say wait a minute is this some kind of ugly trend in and do some self evaluation if you're the ball club and I think but I think um you and I agree that\nThe beginning of this perceived that's my perception I think you'll agree my perception of\nTalent evaluation gone awry started with the untimely end tragic death of Oscar diverse\nYes this is a story that is four years in the making because the cardinals cornerstone there the cardinals ...\nMiddle of the order back prospect me and they've had some prospects come down the line and do a you know and and and I I Know I'm always\nQuick to exclude pools from this discussion because pools has never really prospect pools came out of nowhere [laughter] got to spring training showed that he could a hit the lights out and made the ball club and the rest of his history there was ... years and years of discussion about oh here comes this Albert pool halls guy or we think he might be pretty good there were\nAll electric procedure on to my colleagues across the aisle a\nI Hope they have the wherewithal to land that transformative player that comes in here and completely changes the outlook just by his presence in the middle of the order if it doesn't and you have to continue to operate under\nSimilar roster constructions right now wherever you better be able to pitch and you better be able to catch because with this group of players you're not gonna out hit many if any teams\nThe national league moving forward and I don't see many scenarios where you change your often that dramatically unless it involves the signing of one Bryce Harper a or again maybe made in China I think the odds are better for Harper\nBut if if that doesn't happen to ram or I I I don't see the outlook of this again the fence changing that much which which means you better be able to catch the baseball\nBut the problem is there you don't have enough ... you have even more we're going to disagree even wrong who probably should win the gold glove he still when\nThere's a lot of guys I mean he got to make mistakes it up and like flowers Thomas I'm going to take long out of it I'm going to back off okay 'cause he got better the shifts he did\nIt used to be when he would make a mistake he'd be ruined for the game and some times a week or two now it looks like he's able to get past that and move on so I'm going to take long out of it or capture your center field or in your second baseman are above average in fact about as good as it gets\nAll three gold glove caliber and nobody else's no buddy\nI think the young is approaching that category we disagree on this you don't like beyond as much as I Do for whatever reason\nTo watch them\nI've watched into I watch them too and and and the and the ... say that he's been really great shortstop\nTell you this he really improved we don't have the time to do it now we probably should have actually done some show prep instead of watching the ball game but we sure do defense only\nMaybe we'll do it for one day next week rank the short stops in the national league defense only and\nShe is in a promise you is no better than in the middle of the pack and middle five\nIf your bar is set by as our Simmons\nSaid nationally\nBut I'm just ... I'm going to I'm going to widen the scope a little bit for this conversation for shortstop because Simmons sets the bar and then by a set in a bar in the national league this year and he plays\n... Simmons sets the bar and the bias setting the bar and the national league this year and he plays\nStellar defense no matter where he places skill set is off the charts by as makes some crazy mistakes some time to do in the middle in field you're gonna make bone headed plays because you get a lot of chances and it's difficult to play short stop in second base you're not going to have a flawless\nA sheet when it's all said and done\nBecause it's too difficult and you got too many chances\nBut I'm I'm suggesting that you're setting up a disclaimer there because I never said that so I don't think you meant that for me just as a disclaimer figure next statement\nFair enough okay um so when we see the wrong make\nErrors in ... and he's made a few I think\nYou have to look at the bigger picture and look at the skill set and the skill set is there in the metro say that he's made some really good place and it's not just about fielding percentage what's not cite fielding percentage actually influenced at website a war let's site defense of runs saying\nNo and it was up there I'm not shutting any of them okay fine that's fine but those number say he's pretty good and if he's going to hit me twenty home runs every year are you just change the topic don't keep moving the goalposts when the goalpost I Want my short something to be able to hit a little bit and if you\nWere talking about defense the fence defense defensive\nDefense only so we're okay with him being a top tier defensive shortstop and he can hit two hundred were allowed into to hit two hundred if he can love it is what you're saying\nWhat I'm saying is if our point is pitching in defense you got to get better defensively in particular about the middle but\nWe've seen we defense from the corners both me and from the outfield will kill you just as much in the corner defensive positions are horrific horrific\nDo young as I mentioned I think I sent it out loud really improved really improved but I don't believe he's a top tier defensive player as yet there was a reason he played third base all through the minor leagues because ... yeah um [noise]\nAnd so my point is not to denigrate too young but to say the defense has to get better you've only got three guys that are really really good\nEven if you say for still only half for your team and if you go from half really good and a half completely terrible that's not good\nThat's really ... I wasn't trying to pick on too young but you know what you cardinals fans gotta quit having your favorite little guys that you want to skip a teddy bear and milk and cookies and give them a big dog [laughter] I'm trying to win ballgames\nYou played the way I Need you to play or go play somewhere else\nThat's fair that's fair so we're going to go get who who's white shortage twenty third and were were were upgrading all over the place here\nI don't know do I get your you give me the power to make the deal I I ... I ... made him a chart All right okay good in the scope things are looking good to get up and then baseball and I might play the youngest second move wrong about that but boy I don't watch that topic [laughter]\n\nLet's see I don't know what we don't like that I might drink carbon plenty under first let let's take a break\nWill ah will reassess will come back we'll continue the conversation nights ignite Katie are as a for one to six on the text line the big sport show on the big five fifty\nOr you more than ten thousand dollars in debt feel like you're on a never ending treadmill staying in one place and never getting ahead with those minimum payments you feel like there's no\nWay out don't let the credit card companies bully you any more\nThere are programs in place to help you get free of your debt and you don't have to pay the entire amount you owe the program at total financial freedom can help you get debt free and months instead of decades get off the debt treadmill and stop the harassment\nGet free of credit card debt signature loan department store cards Internet loans and medical bills call now at eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four for free information for about ten years total financial freedom has helped thousands\nThey're a plus rated by the better Business Bureau to get off the endless cycle without having to declare bankruptcy you'll have the right to settle your debt for a mere fraction of what you owe called total financial now\nAt eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four that's eight six six eight four four Seventy three forty four\nPurging please listen for important homeowner information if you are a homeowner in Missouri and I've thought about doing solar panel systems at your home this message is for you everyone was already has no one else incentive for homeowners to install solar beginning on January\nFirst two thousand Nineteen in addition to this federal and state tax incentives are available free sales are starting now last time an offer such and said if they ran out of funding in just six months call today three one for seven zero three thirty eight eighty eight ... a local certified roofing and so we're designing scholar time is running out called today free one for seven zero three thirty eight eighty eight year\nNineteen eighty wind [noise] people were hitting physical with Olivia child Diana Luke\nMTV for their first shuttle launch hands\nDeath in the in this restaurant opened in O'Fallon, Missouri with incredible Peter pasta and salad created by herself\nStepping into this has become a family tradition still serving your favorite dishes and not one foot six locations including their newest ... express on wing haven\nAnd the lakeside shops in O'Fallon check out their Web site that's at pizza dot com for locations menu specially this for lunch or dinner ... or delivery death and he has a shorter satisfy your entire family\nNow with six locations including the newest happening as expressed\nWe have and and the lakeside shops in O'Fallon\nSince Nineteen eighty one\nWay to the price of the family can't afford it Stephanie [noise]\nBig banks have many branches but where are their roots level oil banks in Missouri being your community bank we invite you to stop by one of our seven locations and experienced the advantages of local management\n... decision making and local service for your financial needs go three one for two on two Fifteen hundred\nBanks in Missouri investing in St Louis for over\nYears the I've seen equal opportunity lender\nHiring trying zip recruiter unlike most job boards zip recruiter finds candidates for you and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates bashed zip recruiter the smartest way to hire try for free at zip recruiter dot com slash joined\n[noise]\nSports show on five fifty G.

Luis lawyer was at Wrigley this weekend and I got some great stuff for us from the cardinals clubhouse after the season was over do you think that the foundation that's in place with the young guys I mean guys that we\n\n... we think will be here moving forward is that foundation in place you think it's a good ... and you don't\nKnow it's not good enough that's a problem\nYeah it is it's a pretty darn writers there's a huge problem\nBecause you're not ... we're talking about going out and get Bryce Harper and and that sticks to fix is a lot of things but if you don't think the rest of the club that's in place you\nKnow I I misunderstood you are not sure what you're asking me the rosters it stands now\nThere's ... million young foundation were guys that we think you're going to come up and you know the guy the buddies you guys like ... the guys like the young and won the guys on while he's not that\nYoung anymore okay he's been around already we know he's two fifty here\nSo you're you're basically saying ... unless I'm hearing wrong blow this thing up\nTo ... ... as you could but you can if you if you go back to square one yeah no you're right that's what makes it if it was it's not easy if it was easier than what you say you get ... and and then we wouldn't have talk radio which might be good for society [laughter]\nBut it's really difficult because as we said going back to the deaths of diverse a series of strategic\nDecisions and events have happened that the cardinals or it doesn't seem like it at the time but when you string them altogether are slowly moving backwards\nDespite the idiot wins it makes it seem like it's the same that you're hanging in there but the other teams are getting growing past year so it doesn't ...\nOn the surface it doesn't feel backwards but you are moving backwards\nI got one more piece to my three piece puzzle editor rose we'll Harper\nFruit and the first one was creating an identity pitching in decent parts who's a Russian right field targeting Harper part three is fixing the left side of your bullpen um one thing I think we both agree on is there is no need to address starting pitching on this ... that is a that was the strength at the end of this year I think it will be the strength\nNext year and I don't I don't I don't know who's going to be in that rotation British ... he's going to be there and I don't Microsoft is going to be their brain injury those two guys over there everybody else is I'm a grad yeah we'll see what happens I feel pretty good about the pieces that are there right now and that could be there next year if you want to sign ... Wainwright fine he's reflects charter\n... will move along but there there isn't a whole heck of a lot to do on that front\nIn the bullpen however you have to address the west side of it you cannot continue to pitch to guys like result and Shaw and vital and black men and yell at each and\nName a team they've got a really good left handed hitters scooter does scooter Jeanette I'm mainly team the ... more than likely have a really good luck to you to bet the cardinals cannot counter bin Laden's that's a huge problem grammar and it's really small picture is micro it's next year it's not big picture like Harper\nBut you better figure it out because the cardinals were over matched in lake names and ... you talk about the way short managed to ... it would have been a lot easier for him to do it if you didn't have to turn to ... to get left these out right I just can't happen next year\nAnd I I get I don't have the answer I really don't\nKnow the guy I Know I like his I Wish they would have uh when they made the family tree they would have got the kid Alvarado usually I followed him all year now guy the problem with relievers is even the good ones kind of going a little bit of a roller coaster ride and it's it's a\nThe guys probably going to be a hall of famer she's got ten straight years of great numbers out of a bull pen I'm not even talking about saves necessarily but critics strike out walk ratio while we are a ... year after year after year after year those guys don't come around very often\nAnd when you're talking about ... it's even more rare so even though I kind of you know I got a a thing for Alvarado\nHe could he's still a kid he could come you're not come here and not be good [noise] so I don't know who have you picked the guy you like I have\nNo but I Wish I Wish he was good because I like his\nAre you like I have no no but I don't I Wish I Wish he was good because I like his stuff but he's not good [laughter] so that again that puts your\nI think here Weber both okay and maybe they have a chance to be better\nI got 'em for what ... you got them under control for a while I went with it I mean he's definitely a guy want to see on the roster next year I Hope you're able to figure out a way for him to to be to have a bigger was a bigger role that would come within getting left these out where to start if you can't do it\nThen we're back to square one again and you write Web Web did show at times that he could be considered for that\nRole here's a thing obviously pitching is really hard stupid statement to the so obvious and you would like to think hey dude you got an advantage lefty on lefty all we're asking you was four times a week come in and get a guy out yup four times a week\nThat's it so we need you would think a guy could really lock in and say OK result will never get a hit off me or you know and I'm not worried about the right hand ... and you know have to throw screwball do all righty or a chain all I'm doing is getting yell at each\nEnd result in Adelanto and your Tony ... yeah that's where you are get go get them out but obviously it's really really really I don't yeah I mean I'm\nTalking about the greatest hitters in ball right now and so it's really really hard show how the card was going to do that I don't have even a aghast at an answer for that and is\nIt fair to say it's it's hard to have confidence that they can fix it when the last solution was Brett Cecil\nNo it's not that poor guy [laughter]\nI I I'm Serious so\nLast time he tried to fix it natural receipts\nI shudder to think what the answer would be this time just numbers were good yeah but not a Toronto I could see why you would think you sort of see the stuff\nThat he had been using what has happened I don't know\nI don't know it's been that sharp or they want any progress diesel and its inexplicable it's really and explain what happens\nA lot with relievers and then sometimes they do come back out of it um and I talked about it was closer to before I always call it ... and I'm not saying this to be an insult to him but it's a syndrome that was easy to follow the Ryan Franklin syndrome where you get lit up a few games in a row\nTo the point that you don't trust your own stuff\nAnd so you nibble because you're afraid to throw it over the plate then you end up walking guy then you got to come back I Can't walk him and I throw me ball and then they hit a homerun and it just exacerbates and keeps getting worse and to you you're you can't function\nAnd you see it happen a lot now what happens is then you'll have a rare game and you come in and you\nAnd your stuff is good and you get guys dropped and confidence builds up again so it doesn't mean you know\nTo go blow your brains out right but it just it it means that it is a thing that happens your confidence is shaking you don't trust your stuff you get afraid to throw strikes and then you become a complete mess and can't get anything done\nSpot Ramsey of Britain we see a lot more to talk about involving the cardinals will do it tomorrow night as well it's a big sports show when we come back it's our Monday evening quarterback to

know I get the impression you don't think they're quite a number one material but a stolen beaten and played some pretty good football right now\nOh they're they're playing great football I just think that the main difference between\nCBC in eureka when you when you try to cite them up and and split the hair to the term it you know who's the one spot and who's the ... uh to to borrow a term from like the the the whole selection committee or something like that it's\nProbably mostly strength of schedule and and who they played it and and the ... the number of points that they've been able to score CBC\nI'm just one of those are kind of old school a voters that kind of thing if you want to be the best you got to beat the bath until somebody in the state of Missouri knocks the kid that's off the mountain top\nA then we'll just have to wait and see but they did have a nice winning streak snaps though against uh against this uh saint John's college uh but uh still haven't lost anybody inside the state of Missouri in quite some time\nThat's a good CBC is remember their plane colleges on on the weekend visit beyond beyond playing high schools um\nCNBC you reach a one to the rest of the top five we'll get to the bottom half a second but ... group we some of the west that is a who's who of football powerhouses Missouri\nBall and and you've got you've got some of those football powerhouses starting to finally get to the point of the season that they're going to start playing one another and I think that's what makes the next couple of weeks so exciting what's going to make a folks like a gym powers and myself job on already got this still amazingly difficult if\nMark yet playing the University of Missouri now and he was wide receivers coach that Glenn dealt with by his older brother been marking the ... coordinator\nThey have no running backs on the rocks or it's the weirdest thing ever said with your work or rock or if not a single human being lifted with all the next are there\nAnd I can tell you I can tell you this core Jeff sure studied that led Glendale often for months to put together the OSCE and she has right now and the thing about canned into news they do have Ernie Banks and they and they split\nUm that that five wide and all the pollen ride back out there when they're in the red zone which gives them an added dimension I'm not sure if this quite matches up to their last day title and oh five but\nA ... some people in class for him in ... if they can get to Web\nIn the state quarters I think they give the Web city cardinals a better game they did last year I'll tell you that\nLow and you got to go back to a kind of what I was in high school the late eighties early nineties that used to be the end of the ... for Web said he got wind just started\nBefore the sea started in eighty nine and they ... the state adults and all and it used to be ... on the road up to the lake it was usually really bad weather and they usually came over the last ...\nAnd it's a shame they don't play 'em is as much as they used to and in fact last year was the first time they played\nSince two thousand and five the rest of that a top ten Smith Neal bores into it nine in rolla continues to hang around although interesting game they had to play ... overtime over the weekend and I'm not quite sure the bulldogs but um\nIt I I just think it's a it's a more open more open class for the we've seen in a long time gory\nYeah I I just don't know and and this is coming from somebody that that lives that works in this part of the state as good as Web city isn't as bad I I just don't know that it it's the uh\nThe the easier road to uh the post season that they've seen your most seasons is is a cargo team that their varsity their starters don't see what the third quarter the fourth quarter looks like\nRight ah they're they're having to play in the third and fourth quarter this year so a ... said he gets back to the state championship and if they win that unprecedented Fifteen state title it may be one of the best coaching ah seasons of John Roberts career this was a man\nThat was just named buybacks perhaps as one of the fifth grade at high school football coaches are\nWho my real he's done incredible joy actually really good guy a down there at a ... a in class three\nKorea uh this is a this this starts to get a little interesting as we got split notes at the top four number one in fact six ... place for Odessa six police pretend any solid by cardinal ... Mary will cast you call your thoughts there at the top\nWell at the top two have been a polarizing is you could possibly ask or and I don't I don't think there's any bodies so it's not that you're a fan of ice ... for all\nThat that doesn't understand the to the losses on on trinity sketch oh I mean those were powerhouse teams that are only going to make them better I Know how many division one offers\n... who's the but it's got on the table for all the talent it has I keep watching this one and I keep thinking this is going to be the ... the trinity moves in top on top of a death of the some of the ...\nThe trend of the moves in top on top of a death of the some of the voters just baby needed a couple of more wins\nUh but uh I I definitely think trinity has got the more talented team I Would love to see these two teams play and be able to uh put the votes aside and just look at the scoreboard I think it would be incredible\nStory in the bottom half of class three we have southern boon at Mount Vernon and Springfield Catholic St Clair right down the highway somebody somewhere here in St Louis in ... springs in at number ten\nAlbums springs malls are a much improved football team or the these three or four southwest Missouri teams that you see in the backs cast bill Springfield Catholic read springs Mount Vernon [noise] they're all going to start beating up on what to do over the next court couple of weeks\nWhich will make it very interesting who can hang on to us off the top ten and who may drop out sprinkle Catholic has ice and Riley a uh the one ready quarterback and free safety who's been leading the fight and Irish and their trip a washer and attack\nRemember Mount Vernon or just a year for the state waters off\nSo it was you know they were the number two team in the state they fall and all the way down the upper seven in the polls\nBut there is a lot of talent this class three pool once you drop past wanting to get very even I think if you played you know a court order to Maryville against the St Clair to reach spring I think you'd have very competitive game\nBut I think there's a big gap between Odessa and trinity and then the rest of the\nImplants to Korea Lamar Blair oaks wanted to Mars getting all the food was real close with their long winning streak followed by late syrup Lutheran noise\nAnd wall should still appears to me to be the team to really challenge Lamar when it's all said and done because\nOf their history and traditions course blowing oaks not that long ago a a class three schools so they the most to appear to be on any individual collision course\nWell Wal Mart or oaks are I think there's a lot of people that would like to see all of our lives were at ... go out to get\nA you know I think it's right that would be a fantastic match up to the bearer out again but this is just it's all bars all but everybody else's Lebanon it they've gotten to Haitians longest winning streak\nAnd the Brotherhood of the law has just been a dominant for all the the the those that we give the webs cities in the valley Catholics in the world\nDon't do what the other one's seven titles in a row the order or all in the Missouri and they've done it and there's not a whole lot of reason to believe\nThat they don't have a chance to read an eight and a row I think the biggest I think the biggest challenge to the bar would have been printed he hadn't moved up a class\nRight yeah no doubt along\nWe won't get to see that want to get which I think a lot of football fans really enjoy\nA ... a labor up and walk and kind of beat up on one another last week so often drops a spot that allows the three and three Lutheran your team to move up a spot\nIn the number or a stock that city a Palmyra north Cal only make it round out that class to house sit and there's just been a little bit of a movement and they have a barrier for having a great season down here in the Ozarks\nAh but they've got a loss on their record now they get dropped out of the top ten\nIn class to just a lot going on right now but nothing change and as far as the number one spot goes but unanimous\nAnd that's the same down in class one east Ken and won a tend to squeeze votes but hate chai guinea to boost place there Corey and they're and they're the third team\nWell I think everybody knows what eight hundred years it has a program to add\nThat just you know the phrase the coaches like the your speed kill\nWell how do you all to just have that just stamped on their uniforms they're just only such a a fiercely competitive football team and and they're conservative but couple first place but it's not surprising that the west Rand went from one to\nA thought that if you can and taking over that spot after west ran loses Scotland county or whether it was a fairly competitive game thirty eight to Twenty one was the final\nAnd eat Buchanan play their rivalry gates had to take on it can't it and that was the thirty four twenty games a lot of very competitive match you up\nFor the teams in the top three except for hate Thai and maybe the reason why you're saying hey I get a couple of ... votes now is not only are the undefeated it though but they'd be the class to malls and team Seventy to doubt that I mean they took him to the woodshed\nIt no no question about it and it's a it's going to be fascinated to continue

Twenty one post season starts Ethan tells me for Lester\nAs much postseason action as he's piled up I think he's ... tonight for the Rockies same things off\nFor Lester going up again sorry for free and going up against the cubs freelance at a dynamite season but you dig a little deeper to the numbers walks a few too many guys and his uh\nWest on base percentage it's sort of a deep stat but it's one of those stats is not really sustainable and I think he's trained at something like eighty two percent of the base runners he's put on has really really good\nBut if you're not strike gain out a bunch of hitters especially when you're on short rest I'm not sure this is going to be the ... in the Rockies saw for much of the year\nWe're going to give you our money pick of the night coming up in our second segment but something to think about with these often says on display tonight between the Rockies and\nThe cubbies something else to think about as we'll we'll dig a little deeper into this in the\nTop seven o'clock hour with ramble going to kind of throw our uh some baseball predictions out there when you think about your predictions for the playoffs a new this is something I Would have never guessed first of all I'm\nIn terms of home field advantage what sport do you think has the back of the professional leagues the big for what sport has the truest home field advantage in the playoffs\nLuis\nBaseball baseball and basketball baseball has the truth so feel like that like in terms of the best winning percentage\nBut ... says when I've been thinking about their friends\nFeel because a home field advantage I just took it as well you're playing to the stadium so it's a shorter field\nAnd then you're you can play in Colorado diets like long I'll feel ... years if in air and you can play with really that it's like what the winds are doing and I think basketball well basketball is more like one percent just because a crowd can affect the basketball game\nWell I Would have ... ... that's interesting you you thought baseball first I Would have guessed NFL straight up truest home field advantage in the play offs\nIt's not correct your second guess is right in the NBA has the truest home field advantage in the playoffs the home teams win almost sixty five percent of the time sixty four point eight percent in the NBA playoffs home team roles\nIn the NFL it's second most sixty two point seven percent of the time I Would have guessed in\nThe NFL something like Seventy Seventy five percent you just sitting home field in football maybe more so in college football but to a large extent the NFL as well\n[noise] home teams especially in the playoffs we're talking about teams that are winning you know eleven twelve Thirteen games\nAre usually pretty good in the regular season especially when you get closure division round conference championship around\nI'm surprised the NFL is behind the NBA and that front with sixty two point seven percent there was a drop off after that the NHL fifty eight point one percent of the time the home team wins and I've heard that a lot where we make we sort of make a big deal in the NHL the blues\nUh it just it doesn't matter and we we see that you're in you're out we see that when an eighth seeded LA king team wins a Stanley Cup home ice in the NHL playoffs does it mean a whole heck of a lot but it means more than it does in baseball\nIn baseball the home team in the playoffs only win fifty six point two percent of their games it's not quite\nA coin toss not quite a coin toss but it's close to these six point two percent\nThat's why don't fall in love necessarily with the red Sox or the Braves\n... and it's why we've seen wild card teams the cardinals have done it the cardinals did any eleven the cardinals did it in twelve I stole Ethan speeds and was just going to\nHe was going to drop the ... they started in San Diego and they started in San Diego but but they won they won the central division that year but no I I get your you're absolutely right they started in San Diego I'm cardinals started as the wildcard team and eleven\n[noise] went all the way and then of course and twelve that was the first year for the wild card game and they beat the Braves in Atlanta with the controversy over\nThe infield fly rule which I think still haunts Braves fans today I'm a little surprised about this guys and then it sort of disappointing the cardinals have not hosted\nA wild card game since its institution unless I'm missing something I don't think they have\nWell hosted a ... game in terms of stiff in this incarnation of all what six twenty well they have not had logo ... game than when that guy and it's kind of disappointed that this is great baseball theater the next two nights\nOut of this year [laughter] jak what you would have taken the director yesterday and they are in the wild card today something else to think about guys as as we enter the baseball playoffs\nTeams that are hot teams that are cold\nWe always assume there's this because who's going to be picked a bunch these next everybody's everybody's going to try for the brewers the red Sox the Astros three really hot teams heading down the stretch I'm really mad I told you guys a couple of weeks ago brewers fat twenty two to one when the world series you know what the odds are right now\nSix to one when the world series so you listen to us You're happy man if you were late to the farms are exactly I'm Glad I didn't I didn't I didn't take any action on that but they were twenty two to one and those odds of a dramatically improved I'm not sure mathematically what it incrementally if that's\nIf it's gotten three or four times five times better whatever it is it's gotten dramatically better\nIt into the playoffs they wanted to fish and they will have been the same for the carnival like even if they had made up of they will have free increase for that I had like two percent when it will be more like eight nine ten\nBut they were twenty two to one when they were still leading the first wild card and it was pretty clear they were going to get in but you're right it's it it is a difference from being a wildcard team and beans at divisional champion which makes baseball\nAnd being a wildcard team and beans at divisional champion which makes baseball there there's plenty of things to criticize about baseball but I still think it has one of the best regular seasons when you consider that meeting your decision matters as great as these games are\nYou don't want to be in because you're you're playoff destiny hangs on every single pitch which which makes these games so great\nBut you can play good for five months and have a poor September and that will be the difference between the division and Walker or do a car and not making the playoffs at all\nOr you could be the Yankees and have six straight months and when almost a hundred games and be in this game tomorrow\nOh because the rest of us had ... months or so that's ... that's just weird and ridiculous an awful lot of the same time\nAnd game to game one sixty three yesterday that had to be difficult to manage just like you want to win the division but\nGreat pointed in ... Italy and and Joe mad and yesterday he was rolling through the bullpen pretty good\nIn Milwaukee when they when they got the lead then that is I Do get now hey there will pitch ... mop like yo man did everything they could because he had the lead for it really was died for most of the game until Milwaukee didn't do what they did\nSo again it's good to be on awesome how um how\nJoe manages this game because the school to grow I think everybody in the can that can play a sea without um um the starters that will be for game on if they advance but it's an advanced ... and then they have that problem\nOne more so than I was telling you this the hot tea before we got mixed up in the in the in the wild card games", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "02"}
