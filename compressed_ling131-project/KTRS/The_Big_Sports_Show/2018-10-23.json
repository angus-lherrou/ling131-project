I mean we're seeing both in use early an earlier in the postseason\nIn terms of his adrenalin you know the results are going to tell you what he's got\nAnd if he's if he's cruising than I think you I think you go through guy including Kurdish I was going to be the same way uh it's it's just funny because all we've talked about this postseason itching to get guys out of the game this might be an example where you see a legitimate starting pitching dual it both guys are delivering deep into a game I mean\nI don't know that either manager is going to want to rush to pull their guy\nIn game one of the series of things going to be a war and a man I Know that baseball has to be happy because he couldn't have asked for\nTwo more follow teams ... to be I mean this is exactly what baseball once and it would be pretty cool to see these guys go after it pitching dual style deep considering everything this postseason has been in the opposite direction\nIt to encourage shot back in this spot she still waiting banned for that postseason moment the the Chris Carpenter moment if you will the Madison Bumgarner moment those guys have had\nDominant postseason and courage shot I think he did get a bad rap is postseason numbers aren't that bad but when you look at a guy who's been may be the best picture of a generation and see him pitch like a mortal when October rolls around\nA day and he was better in last year's World Series at times but this is again he's chance\nTo put that stamp on his resume to where the people won't say crush of was the best of this Arab blocked he can go out there and and take a bite out of the sentence and he he may just be the best in the last fifty years\nYeah the Dodgers in some ways are kind of\nLike ... ... I mean there he's kind of a microcosm of this team\nHas been very good they've been dominant as of late on their front office is making the moves they're paying the money they have the stars but you know they're going to be judged there in that realm where they're going to be judged World Series or the up and they think they came so close last year and it was\nYou know in LA there is no there is there is no moral victories it's it's you know you're a champion or not\nAnd that's kind of what I think this whole Dodgers team as\nAs as lived under for a while now of course I was really the ... ... to me that if they can if they can pull this thing off than than that celebration is going to be one that you know is is even sweeter because they came so close to it last year um and a lot of those guys most of those guys are back\nSo they're stacking the Dodgers than I'd been stacking right hander is against sale everybody in the line of batting from the right side Brian does your Justin Turner\nDavid Freese many Machado Chris Taylor Mac can't\nKick it Hernandez ... Boston Barnes one through nine right handed expanding it's interesting to me that they continue to put David Freese there in that three spot I mean he lives for this time of year and David Freese a again not the player he was back in twenty eleven but the one thing freezer can still do is mash left handed pitching\nAnd it's perfect role for him tonight and that and again this is for the Dodgers that is a lefty mash in line to be at Turner or does your or Taylor or camp are obviously the shadow right there in the middle east are gonna hit sale these are the guys that can do it\nThe Dodgers basically have two different line up to do both of them are good enough to be a lot of the team do you follow the right um there's a really interesting story to be written about Freeh's when you look at when he joined the team\nHow he is played since but also how the team has played since I'm somebody should write it and you know it could even tie it back into time here in ... in St Louis but I mean that team is really\nCaught fire since he became a part of it and I'm\nNot saying he's the reason why but he's got he had to play a factor in this he brings that experience he he's he's been there and he's done that is such a\nSuch a likeable guy and he he's delivered since ... since he put on the uniform he you know he's going to play a part in this series and if history tells us anything it'll be a meaningful role and a what a smart edition by the Dodgers to to pick him up that was kind of the addition that\nI think a lot of people outside of St Louis for maybe kind of raise their eyebrows at you know freezes not jump off the map and ride oh my God you know the postseason hero except for here we knew what it was about and he's proven that again since he's been with the Dodgers\nYou know you take a look at for his career posts\nSo you know you can you take a look at\nFor his career post see here's I think David Freese two hundred and six\nPlate appearances in the postseason me that's actually a lot for a guy that\nReally isn't thought about as I get outside of St Louis as an everyday player been two hundred and six postseason plead appearances flashing sign that reads to eighty three three fifty six\nFive twenty seven or nine career postseason homeruns thirty five postseason career RBI pretty darn good\nWell there's a discussion going on now is to eat ... value in those statistics you know there's a constant debate now this post the postseason statistics mad or are they big enough sample size or they relevant is it fair to say that Clinton crushes on her performed the post season that David Freese has been a monster in the postseason or is this just gives us all look\nAnd I really don't understand that argument that that'll be it at either can't put him back now and again\nI'm that guy I Believe in the numbers I'm not I'm not a guy who tells you that they don't matter but how can you how can you do anything in life\nAnd say that the the setting the pressure the moment don't have an impact I mean when you\n... you can apply it to anything you want when you shot free throws in your in your in your backyard compared to shooting free throws with a high school basketball game on the line when you took your ACT practice test on your kitchen table with your mom watching\nOr when you took it in a in a lecture hall with with all of your friends around you\nDifferent moments have different sorts of pressure\nSome people handled them better than others even professional athletes who make their careers out of handling pressure some guys do it better than others some guys get through it some guy shrink from it and some guys hit this place where they get better and David Freese is an example of a guy who for whatever reason when the spotlight the brightest he's better", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "23"}
