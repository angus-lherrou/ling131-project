little bit the or the as did a good job didn't uh yes I did yes they did but uh\nUh you know we were talking off the air I when I was a little a little bit involved and the story I I was told from some people on kind of the ... the league side of things that\nAh if St Louis county stadium they will get a team and that's that's how much the league wants St Louis the market that tradition everything about St Louis now this was before the boat the vote the St Louis city vote which is why the April of two thousand Seventeen now have the other cities\nLeap to add of St Louis or are there are there I\nAsked a landscape change in in in terms of the competition I don't think so so I if they can get this all tied up by I I I think there there is going to be a MLS soccer and and in St Louis and I just think it would be fantastic\nYou know about sports hierarchies and those who runs sports and committees and owners you're you're all year round the\nThe top of that a caste system uh with the NFL [noise] could you see\nIn a boardroom MLS guys going well yeah they said that before we've been waiting for a stadium from them meeting St Louis for twenty five years to see maybe a little jaundiced eye looking this way or do you think being aware of what's going on and in this new group um\nControl rebounds a little better do some of those to leave ... elite saves and and he hasn't done that this year now so some of the\nSome of the play in front of a ... by some of the people you know ... and ... talked about it he too bad goals where he let tastes getting inside of him and they didn't get a stick on I'm going to buy any he talked about it or just yesterday I mean he realized what happened each you can't you can't do that but again\nIf you're on a panic I mean you look at Carter hot and he's playing very well in Buffalo again it's only three games in Philly who's so his first start down in\nSan Antonio he pitched a shutout so yeah there's some things to think about it in a in a relative term if we're talking about a football season uh sixteen game football season we'd be right about at half time on the first game here through to to the game so you you don't want to overreact but but still [noise]\nAll the stuff that that dog are strong did all the tray that trade stuff the free agency developing of this young talent I looked at all if you don't\nHave a goalie\nIs not going to work even he told a story a years ago he was he was hiring coaches and whatever coaches interviewing said yeah you know go or having a a a good goalie is is eighty percent of what you need and if you don't have one in a hundred percent [laughter] that's a great line that so that's that's kind of where we are we're\nCircling revisionist history on this last night because let's let's say last year Jay ... heads the season ends in both Jake gallon quarter hunt and would have been free agents there the same age\nSeem experience but the blues don't have an island locked up for you know the number of years they did which made the decision easy you had the lead quarter hunt and walk\nIn and when was your guy not so much that an earned it but because of the human situation salary cap all of that it it's just\nIt's the way it had to be so\nWhat do you think would have happened if both would have been free agents and and the team could have sort of ... when this guy to be our goal tinder do you think they would select the quarter hunt\nWell based on place certainly now ... is he's about what three to four years older than than than Jake out doing a career backup more yes exactly right yeah and they play and that's important ... very important he\nHe did about as good a job of playing well on a contract share as anybody I mean in any sport maybe the best year a one a I mean he started what about twenty five twenty six cases has had\nMaybe emitted history I mean our goal is above you up I think like ten games appearances he had the same percentage invest goals loud I think they knew\nThat they couldn't afford him\nSaying before to keep Jake out at the end of season a press conference a locker clean out what have you ...\nAt the end up season a press conference a locker clean out what have you dug arm frog said this is a big year for Jake Alan and if he has a another year like last year he just won't be around because you'll be at the stage of the contract\nWhere it's ... maybe financially better to to to to ah to get rid of him or try try to cut and I haven't and\nI think that's a sensible logical accurate statement and plus you you believe in the guy and I do it but since ... sensible logical statement however\nThat doesn't fly with the fans they don't want to wait another year they want to win this year it's been fifty one years they want to wind down they would win this year and he said well you know if this doesn't work out well what do you mean if this doesn't\nWork out this better work out I bought the tickets for next year for this year this year you know you know there's a change that might not work out you should have told me yeah yeah and and again a lot of good movies and you can see really good moves on just\nEven just in into games you can see it starting to jail somewhat O'Reilly has has been everything so far ... face off he doesn't have a goal but he has for us is you can see how that chemistry starting to\nTo a a star between ... and ... in ... on on that line and I think the young guys that play at a time but I and\nWe can maybe get into them later but I I think they're they're all very talented in in ... going to be good pros\nThe uh I have kind of a naive but you know I'm a lineup nerd and I'm Wondering if Mike will\nSolely or maybe not solely it seems to me that there's a couple of lines that and maybe it's just because they were playing the Blackhawks but both nights looked a little slower step behind to me\nAnd I wonder if spreading some of the youth throughout the for a long range might help pick that up and again I Know that's naive I don't know the strengths and weaknesses of all those young guys I was just a thought it was I was sitting there aghast watching the games\nYeah having a guy like Cairo an asset 'cause he's he's very fast I I think he would be in the upper end of anyone in the league\nAnd I think as he gets more and more ... air and bad it into the line up and gets more minutes his feet will be more noticeable\nBut uh we we talked about this several times late late last year brand and just about how it just didn't seem like the blues were were fast enough and even some of the new guys ... not a fast skater O'Reilly is not a fast ... last but they bring other ... fell a lot a lot of other assets and but you have guys like\nCongress very fast I Would say Thomas's fast\nAnd play is at least average but he's social skills in in his instincts as offensive or scales and\nWe'll see what happens with the uh uh ... with the lines there then and knew we are we close to a break here butter ... we're we're close but if you knew he was showing\nThere's not a whole lot now in the minor league system their tongue guys are up here and a lot of the guys some of which\nAre many fans wanted to go there's no you ask and there's no ... no cage Thompson\nSo you're basically stuck isn't the right word but these forwards that you have now you're pretty much got to live with them now you can mix them up\nDuring games in ... which yo yo yo did the last game I like that he didn't like what for Iran uh was doing in the game which wasn't a whole lot of anything so he dropped him down to the fourth line Blake was playing very well and uh\nUh causing a little bit of havoc behind them that's playing much more physical than we've seen before he moved came up [noise]\nBut in terms of well let's bring somebody up from San Antonio not not this year\nIn Oakland constant isn't ready you you've got some other guys down there but they're they're just not ready and you've got some other guys an air Foley associate cost there still injured they're still out with concussion so it's got to come within these Thirteen four words that are on the team now we\nWill take a break and I'm curious because who's going to take that plays a burglar ... and ... especially Brooklyn you know the whipping boy the the guy that everybody target of\nWhen you should you meant who's going to take his place me someone that has all the site and skill and doesn't get anything done what you meant that guy [laughter]\nUm because I liked the there and he was he didn't that seem to be very popular and and there's you know it gets you on that very early Jake and whether it be the easy answer but ... the news is we're ... we got the pro Alan and then the anti Allen sections and I think there is still very\nMuch alive cookie bakers in the sweat on earth [laughter]\nI'll buy what I Want to hear what you think that the new ... new target of

D me a little bit of Hillary we'll see if you're going to need a jacket you're going to need a jacket ... rap ... that that\nWould that would do as well that would do as well are you a five day forecast\nComing up a little worried or you might be right [laughter] um bend this was this this was significant today and I'm ... and again we've been all over at all night here on the soccer front but um as as a guy that I I think you know when we've all been kind of patiently waiting for this what what what was your take on\nOn this news kind of abruptly coming up earlier this morning\nBut I think uh you know I think it's a it's a win for for soccer fans that to me it seems as close as\nSt Louis has been and I know that they have been closed before and I felt like they were just around the corner and I think fans here almost nervous when they you know they they don't want to believe it until there's a game being played that at this point but this feel\nVery real uh when you talk about the Taylor family getting of all they don't put their name on something like that or they're pretty sure it's in a work um you're talking about no no I'm a vote\nThat could derail this thing you're talking about it you know almost entirely private money attacks that would you know come off of concessions and things that people that are attending the event and nowhere else I'm you're talking about you know some major major money involved\nAnd and basically what book called like it is basically a wink wink nudge nudge from the league that if you put a team here we're coming or if you put it they were coming and it's been that way for a long time been MLS officials were making it known to anyone who would talk to them that if if St Louis\nWe're making it known anyone who would talk to them that if if St Louis has a stadium they're going to get a team\nAnd everything else is just you know we can talk about these other cities we can talk about these other potential stadium projects elsewhere but they want to be here in the league wants them to be here and other teams in the area want them to be here so they can have you know a close a closer level it makes too much sense for\nSt Louis not the habits of the stadiums always been the biggest\nThe biggest what is it now it sure sounds like as long as they get the approval from the alderman that's always scary anytime anything gets the older man it's scary but it sounds like most of them had positive comments today and get some get some backing from the state where it just sounds like they've had\nYou know inroads there I'm now that uh that Governor and pull up is out of office that sounds like they're actually might get this thing done\nOne thing we haven't talked about you had been in and I'm going to be I'd be curious to hear as we get closer and closer to a you know the finality of this coming down the pike but uh you hear it a lot and I think it's been sent a lot easier um\nYou know in terms of being the three sports town the ... the sports fans dollar ... and spreading it around to three teams is\nIs that something we should pay close attention to is it worth paying attention to or or do you see it a day as as kind of a non starter ... uh you know the MLS in and they'll be seasons or or ... you know can current they are going on at the at the same time\nThe other three quarters Missoula out I'll plead shop Caroline I thought it was clear and oh yeah you didn't get in and the four corners and things like that but those situations were set up because of the complete a panic and\nFrustration of the third quarter insure me\nLike I'm like I say coaches might have been doing everything they could pull these guys together and keep them from panicking and do all those things\nNot being there it's hard to say but it's so like everybody including ... sort of a lost their traction you know the the slippery shields sort of was the metaphor for everybody\nYeah I think he nailed it and you know one of the things that they didn't do which I Wish I would've tried is just call a timeout\n... basketball coach time I mean just call it yet three I've got all your time outs left and not one you know that that that that play it all started when Mario ... rockets long touchdown run was overturned right Renee\nThey said he stepped out of bounds it was hard it was a ... I don't know how they came up with enough evidence to overturn it they ruled it a touchdown they went back and looked set except that amounts now was it a bad call I don't know what evidence they saw the kid angle that I I saw one conclusive but still he still had a long run that put them in great field position\nInstead of going out there and punching a touchdown they go out there and have a false start they have a an sports from like conduct penalty is crooked gets caught no Jack and some guy in his face masks\nThey get pushed back they botched the pont um I didn't I think that a holding in the south Carolina scores than Missouri and then it just start this is just start this\nThis downward spiral and not once in that point the burial what I mean he was one of his time out to just get us to Hassan and say hey snap out of it you know we're still in good shape it we've got a wake up we gotta we gotta take a deep breath it just seemed like it was one thing after another one of the time they knew it\nYou know it was almost had to read and still they came back from that rain stop you know they started getting their their their again going as almost like they will soon as the rain stopped they started remembering they could play football again\nBut you know on that last dry they had this huge field goal the biggest yoga Tucker McCain's career fifty seven yards I was stunned that he made it I mean it was I was floored that he made it and I looked at the clock no oh no you know they gave them too much time\nAnd sure enough on the next Dr they let a tide NGO uncovered down in the middle of the field and and and and the markets ac drops a wide open interception that would have won the game they just didn't make the winning plays and I think a lot of it comes with that third quarter slide in in a lot of it's going to be traced back to\nLast year's loss to South Carolina where\nThey were playing a good game and all of a sudden the boat Samuel breaks kick return for a touchdown and it was like\nEverybody just went into you know when to when I went to the chaos smoked for a while\nAnd by the time they snap out of it has to have um I Do think this team responding to adversity responding to something that doesn't do which way is something that a lot of fans are going to pick up and say why hadn't gotten better I think that's a fair criticism because that is coaching says you have to you have to get your team to collect its collective breath\nAnd say okay we got to move on one play can't turn into one bad quarter\nSomeone play can't turn into one bad quarter which turns into a bad half not against good teams and that's why\nVery Odom is up against them now because he hasn't been able to prove that he can be good teams can beat up on that on conference teams they can they can win some conference game but they can't seem to beat teams that win more than they lose and that's kind of been his MO so far during these three seasons\nOr then they lose and that's kind of been his demo so far during these three seasons now he's going to get a chance he's going to have to prove that wrong if they're going to get to\nYou know a respectable record this year they can get to seven wins but it's not going to be all that easy you got to be Memphis which is a a decent team you got to take care of the three bad teams in in the in the SEC east\nYou got to beat Florida ... got to be tendency you got to be Vanderbilt and you're gonna need to be to Arkansas at the end of the year because right now I don't know if this team go out and beat a Kentucky and I don't think it's going to go out to be a Florida either because they haven't shown as they can do that that was why this was a swing was getting his team's show up against\nThe FCC east teams and and right now we haven't seen anything that suggest they can\nI think it was you in in your column you said you know at the beginning of the year the south Carolina game was that this was going to be a pretty big win\nWell even did get that when because of the circumstances surrounding that that probably wouldn't have been as big a wind as a we all saw a few weeks ago but hell it's still feels a lot better than the last the ended up picking up and said\nYeah and it was you know South Carolina I don't think the team and\nI hate seeing that they're not their hearts I Do not but\nThey played with their backup quarterback who is a senior and he had been thrown Thirteen passes and this guy hadn't hadn't played a meaningful game since the Spurrier was the coach and he goes out there and make some issue look like no J. B. B. team and I don't get it it's a second time now a backup quarterback has made them just looked terrible\nThrowing the ball and he's doing it in the rain\nSheila can't connect completed pets he's under throwing everything during the worst touched that works in a section of his career and it's Michael scratches looking like you know Drew Brees out there which is the last ... that's got to look back it was the Purdue backup who\nWho did it I mean this is a defense that berries went on charges of two thousand Fifteen so you know he's had time to recruit he said time we get players and get the scheme right this is not some new fangled system\nSo I think the defense of concern is real now I'm not going to go as far to say that we know what's going to happen to him at the end of the season right now because they're still half of the football season to be played\nAnd there's no interest in making any sort of a change like that right now but I Do think it's fair to say look this is not that was a big loss and they got some big big games come up and the second half that they put it against South Carolina\nThen things probably aren't looking too good for him but but he knows that I mean I don't think he has the me assurance that that he's on some you know lifetime contract he's at the lowest buyout and the FCC that probably he's got the lowest contracting the SEC is found in his contract or some of the lowest in the high major football\nSo he's not exactly an expensive coached to upgrade he knows what the reality is but I'm interested to see how his team responds because they don't bounce back this one and they're not going to beat Alabama but if they don't bounce back after Alabama\nThan we probably will be talking about what might be next for this\nTeam and a big picture small picture here and this is a little discouraging uh today ad media day drew lock a being a ... speaking of a conversation he had with your duly after today's practice and he let us in on something that I I I'm not sure we knew about it until today and listen to this\n... drew\nSays we're going to the game plan a little bit um I think one of the main things um\nFor me is I just want to make every play\nAnd I want to be ... or so and sometimes I've got to realize you know they got this play in the back so that over the years have put down um\nAnd that's that's been hard for me to adjust to a specially like in this office were\nLast year I might be able to like as far as I can be disease and there's just\nAll different it is what we should be running\nIs just you know it's it's it's tough because you want to be George so bad you only South Carolina so bad\nFor you guys you know it's All right I'm a thought I was on the diversity of her interest is limited in Iceland is a little\nStrange been because with those words it sounds like drew is is nowhere near where he needs to be in this all sense and were five games into the seasons\nWell I was a little and it's so tough to an eye out for that was not at the game at South Carolina they matter was there covering it for the post dispatch we'd have to have a a columnist there so I only know what I watched on TV and I did watch the game\nUm I watched it twice and and and I had just had a feel with drew that it seems like when drew makes a mistake or when he makes those intersection has met you can look on his face like they're trying to think of doubt his mind that he's going to go out for a touchdown next play like hunting and sometimes it almost frustrates fans because he doesn't even seem to get Bob\nThis game with a little different um he almost looked kind of\nNot taken aback but a little bit just kind of\nGlossed over and watching his facial expression it didn't seem to be the same and he was constantly worried about his hand to hand for what he was really worried about keeping them Dr McKee was all ... and uh I think it I think to me that thing that jumps out is he doesn't have\nThe guy that he can make that play too he's talking about you know if a play breaks down I can just Chuck it and it might turn into a superhero throw well who's that superhero receiver it's it's a manual hall yeah\nAnd he's not out there and really changes the whole you know the whole shape of this off and it's when you have a receiver who can take a top off a defense everybody has to be\nBe behind him or somebody has to be behind them at least one guy and Manuel ... plays have come and play that have broken down where he Andrew it's kind of back your back yard football it and turned into a touchdown and now that he's out\nAnd who knows when I'll be back you're not going to play against Alabama which is as or I call go and you don't speak Korean injury you might not be\nA hundred percent the rest of the season um then you're talking about you're talking about dynamic part of your off until all of a sudden gone and now that guy's boss there have you tried to make that play with another receiver it probably does turn into an interception so\nAre either they he he he scared me there but we didn't we didn't have to everyone in the studio rose yeah moment for brief well done any moment\nThere that was a that was good stuff um [noise]\nWhat do you sense in there that I was that it made me made me take note there as well or use basically a ... wasn't here though I'm not sure if he thought gee tea but will that will certainly has that message along the J. T. and then we're not going to you know hock them doesn't work here but we'll pass it along to Benjamin as well a great\nGuy yeah ...\n... uh we got a loan everybody no question about it we got to run here again stay tuned if you are\nA psych to buy this MLS news today because I feel it's got to talk it over with one of the guys instrumental in getting this thing done\nJim Cavanaugh will have that interview for you when we come back ... we'll see you on the radio with guy Philips tomorrow we're already you gotta that's wherever a bread and it's the big five fifty Katie are expected this\nEvokes girls energy airmen boy do I do you deal with this deal is that you get all the rats can always when you do to my new one hundred percent white began see five dollar penalty on you also get mashed potatoes and gravy and biscuits ago can agree with this year deal I guess the building that deal or no damn see soon to get the two piece all white made five dollars\nAnd it's only available for limited time we'll\nBring you can get I get your ... your ...\nThat happens all the time you're driving down the highway and think there goes another one and you wonder again how much more you and your family would enjoy camping if you had one to\nCall you can find out and Bill Thomas camper in West village a short drive on Seventy when you get there you'll see what sets Bill Thomas Cameron parts from everyone\nElse they carry over twenty five ... traveled trailers ... hollers expandable motor home Sanders largest air stream dealer in the mid west the only one in St Louis was nine or string brands available the teacher smart controlled technology or maybe you've never camped Bill Thomas camper would love to see you in person more on their\nWebsite and meaty camper dot com\nWhere you can see their full inventory and get useful information like sewing guys that will help you make sure your vehicle into the unit you want to buy easy financing is available to get you on the road and making memories learn more\nThe tea camper dot com real deal in real value in middle Thomas camera building dream is their business meaty camper dot com [noise]\nComing to load to live on everything you need to get your home ready for holiday visitors and you're out in the mountains are bad enough I listen to look up to forty percent I'm like man and one advantage of our ... and today on all kinds of products and supplies for helping tackled your to do that in your side or\nBy your local loves to learn more projects that the ... start with loans entity ... solutions apply while the ... election Barry seized over details [noise]\nThat may be\n\nSame way\nSo you're not home\nSt Louis Missouri three one voice for five to five and\nHe's the old standard for Reuben and perhaps I used to be lower than other bonded that ensured root for when you invest money into fixing a hole in your roof or putting on a whole new roof you want the peace of mind that you'll get only with recruiting\nMuch you can always depend on an immaculate clean up when the job has been completed by rhetoric tone licensed in insured proof well\nHow\nDid you find more\n\nLittle big sports show on five fifty street\nG. R. and case you missed it on the guy Phillip show they had Jim cabinet talking and less for the Lou [noise]\nGuy show\nFor forty six Tuesday Afternoon [noise]\nAll of a series of radio station and I think collectively in St Louis but have heard so far about the prospect of an MLS team here are just to go back we have Jim Cavanaugh the c._e._o. worldwide technology here in Westport Jim walk into the show thanks for coming on my life your\nGuy I Know you've been a busy guy today since the announcement the ... was most shocking to me and I loved hearing is this a team if and when that happens a is a majority owned by women\nAnd ... year it says one of the few women controlled ownership groups and all the professional sports the only thing that's the the the downer on this is that now my wife will want\nOne [laughter]\nSo explain that old but it does or how to how is that all ah come come about how this all happened today\nWell it has it that it's that it's pretty interesting out try to fast track that discussion but we obviously had a run ads bringing on I'm seeing her before it did not play out for a number of different reasons\nFor a number of people felt dark thought that there was a ... there there was a plan B and there was NO PLAN B\nShow unfortunately when the vote did not go through\nEverything pretty much what's around the sheltering and died at that point to\nAnd say oh it's a Ninety a hundred and twenty days ago Andy reached out to me and asked if you know if I'd be interesting to go out to a launch just catch up on that show and just got to get my perspective\nOn a I'm a lot then and what was going on and what I really felt about this\nYou know why why I thought it was good for St Louis and see what we talk through a number of different things and\nFor Saint Louis and see what we just talk through a number of different things and so the digested that went away and I thought that was probably going to be the end of it in a [laughter] he\nKept you know called again so let's get together again I talk about it we talked a little bit more about it I think the more we talked about it a lot more that she felt them both of us felt that you know this is just a an opportunity mess\nBy St Louis and this is something that St Louis need a [laughter] and that we really just started digging into you know what would it take financially what for some of the challenges of the past effort\nAnd um what would be the likelihood if we you know put together a you know a group here or a team and uh and what would the likelihood of backing it up and that and we've really started talking through those kind of fast track that discussion Carolyn\nI'm a I got involved and you know pretty soon after we\nWe had these discussions and we really just kind of interested on what would this look like a you know we talked about\nYou know ah and fall as your lead from the the last group you know we're talking to a little bit about it but some of the unique things I think that are unique and and and beneficial to this\nIs a partnership that we created is that it is all St Louis since all is a fantastic guy a just a great businessman and and then somebody committed to doing things the right way\nYou know anti and I are both you know born and raised in Saint Louis you know run businesses and\nDone a lot of things here and along with all the philanthropic things that the Taylor family has done a worldwide we've collectively Don a tent and ties to the soccer we just called you know there's just a great a great set into pets where we we basically said let's do it\nAnd ISIS soccer you you play professionally\nYeah yes I'm born and raised in Saint Louis north county\nYou know I ended up going to St Louis university played at St Louis university and played a couple of years professional so uh you know I feel very fortunate I I if I didn't get a scholarship to go to St Louis university\nUh I probably wouldn't have gone to college I Would probably be and construction or it'd be nothing wrong with that you know like I was a there were just a\nA a lot of good things that have happened to me that I benefited from that and a ... I feel passionate about the game and I think the good things that the game of soccer can do for kids and for the community so uh that's where I think that the you know the our mutual ... man\nTaylor family myself and my family ah we again we just came back and said this is something that that we think St Louis snakes and\nWith all the I think there's a lot of good things going on eight billion dollars a construction projects in the downtown court or a compliment that for the last team that you know I think is really\nYou know it's a ... big supporting you know a sport global sport that I think is on the rise and really attracts millennials in a significant way I think this is all good for ...\nAnd ... and I'll tell you a the bruising the putting your a gym because uh you are part owner of St Louis see you here right here in the big budget\nWill be a strong breeze today right now looks like it's going kind of left to ride on the pitch it will be cooler we won't have the Ninety degrees anything that we've had many nights years apart\nSo it should be an easy not weather wise for the St Louis teams now for our line of because it is a seven o'clock kick off today so they're still in your car trying to get in get here\nBecause you know you hear a little late you might miss a goal or to scores early but to start in life for this one tonight will start off with Oklahoma City angle tonight also are also yes Oklahoma City on Saturday\nOklahoma City tangled tonight also our Tulsa yes Oklahoma City on Saturday thank you\nToss a rough next here tonight [noise] say being ... who has been\nPretty good at all things considered one hundred sixteen save this year most ever in the league of the season is one hundred and thirty and he's got two games that are going to break the record will ... is\nVery good but his you know you can only you can only standing or had so many times do Google ... with his feet [noise] um but it's a it's a tough job\nIn the back for Tulsa tonight you've got ... we got Joshua Martin ... book of itch on the last ... Smith a six four in there as well yeah\nJust not a lot of experience ... which is the name there you can play in the left side of the center of the backyard employers the left back uh he'll come forward and hit restart she's a very good player he's won championships with Sacramento\nA had a stint with India eleven and an ESL very good player but uh again it's a it's an inexperienced back for it would be the ... for me for for ...\nMidfield tonight a lot of new names in the uh line up tonight for Tulsa Claudio Munoz Chris Rodrigues a piece of our eyes and Paris Gee [noise]\nThat I say that ... was in the back and I'm Sorry I meant the killing fields ... it's a really it's a it's a very very young group [noise] um ... says dangerous as a wide right player he he's quick he's he's good on the counter he'll give ah\nThey'll give our left side of the back of fits with his won't be one ability and and can provide quality service um [noise] but um yeah outside of that it's a young group\nMichael and see it as a coach here he's got two guys lifted up top that's Michael gamble and I think the U.S\nWill be able to go to as of late the Wake Forest product a good athletes got some pace has some trick to them we'll see how much support he has but he would be the guy that that you have to watch out far as I'm president ... gone with the what the el Salvadoran national team who was the leading tour\nThat he had to Thirteen goals on the season for Tulsa as you look at this point you mentioned they're young they have less than ten rules on the season and the starting line of\nYou know this is a this is a team that we can impose ourself on um [noise]\nThis is a this is this is a three points for taking right now I don't know how to put it like to put it in a nicer way but this is these are three points you must stay\nFor St Louis F. C. is they come into tonight's actions I mentioned they're forty nine points on the season that puts them\nThe same number of San Antonio in a final spot in the U.S ... western conference table but there are two matches for St Louis and only one for San Antonio starting in gold tonight for head coach at that they feel is is ...\nDespite the loss to Phoenix Tomas was very very good made some tremendous saves [noise] um [noise] he was he was sharp so he's he's the guy that's going to carry us from this point forward\nFell on our list five in the back Tony walls fan while ... Vita Sean rental Sam fake tile culprits and [noise]\nI Would just be surprised if we don't see four in the back I mean we are going to be without wall fall [noise] who's who's injured not listed in the Eighteen we're going to be without power Greg who's not listed in the Eighteen as well correct right so I'm Will Anthony change systems and and go to a\nTo a fire or three center back\nSystem that we saw on during the year during the mid season or what we played with four in the back\nAt just the way the guys are are listed here it just doesn't look like a three center back to outside back system I think we'll see for and I think we'll probably see Tony walls as a central midfield player and he's putting that quite often for sure and he and his career yeah\nAlso and the midfield position listed on the street for St Louis ... Lewis Hilton number eight ... history on one side Dean Baker is on the other\nSo I'm I'm assuming will see Tony walls partnered with Louis police rewrote wide and a and decrease wide [noise] um [noise]\nIt's a it's a good midfield bakers I thought was one of our top players there in early September late August and we could use another another good about from him this evening and this could be the type of team that he can really good after with his athleticism is creative nature\nUp top for St Louis tonight is Dale matching ... Greg audible line up and his double digits and goals will be missed what you got guys like Albert decorum Cory ... who can come in and scoring and saying how\n... how nice is it to have a you're leading scorer injured and and put on Corey hurts our who's\nBeen in a in the league for a long time as good a number of goals\nAnd ... who is as dangerous as anybody in a great set up guy for type like hers are and then have Michael Cox sitting on the bench you can also score goals for you so it's a it's a it's a core set up were set up really well I'm an you know the ... thing is not them all\nBut it's still a very good very up front and it's as good as what you're going to find in this league\nNow on the reserve squat you've got Michael Cox Seth Rudolph Boston march party jumps in Boston a lot better titles for walks and Jake federal some back it up and do [noise]\nYeah I mean it's again it's there's ... there you can you can go to your bench\nUm coach Anthony can go to his bench and he can he can change the way of the game is being played by who he inserts awesome what better complain to back you can walk things sounds how far can lock things down in the back of covert some struggling\nA jets in March Rudolph can change things as white men feel players or central players for Jefferson Cox and get it done up front so he's got good balance\nHe has players that can go in and change how the games being put [noise]\nSouth side for a key to the game which sale always give to us and he's got three of them usually one time we only had two [noise] and they were all dead on so what are you saying how many do we have for ...\nGot three okay we've got three it's such a big game you have to have very good [noise]\nYou know my first he was going to be one area but I kind of changed after looking at it pulls his line of the patient maintain your shape\nKeep your organization you don't have to win the game and the first minute it would be nice to score early for sure and maybe the number two will lead us into into early goals and early opportunities but the way that it's also it's set up with the youth that they have an inexperienced I think for sure\nWe will find ways to get chances and I think based on what they have here we're gonna we're gonna limit their opportunity so\nYou don't have to when you don't have to win the conference or the playoff spot in the first ten minutes of the game let's make sure that we we maintain our shape stay organized play off of each other's smartly don't don't feel like that it's gonna take a one player to run through everybody there to to create chances\nThat's carried over one is St Louis matches up against Tulsa tonight how 'bout key number two now\nThe number two is the opposite right after it did take the temple you know speed play has always been a strength of ours um here for the last six weeks outside of the Phoenix gain we have dictated the temple him play and teams have been uncomfortable playing against us [noise] so um press\nWe've been better when we press high we've been better when we really got after people in force them to play quicker than what they wanted to [noise]\nYou better when we really got after people and forced them to play quicker than what they want it to what we're on the ball we are a\nMuch better side when the ball is moving quickly and people are getting freed up author march early so that we can play ball it's quick end to people and and just through speed to play create opportunities so those are those are two ways that we need to be able to dictate the temple the game and that includes Jim trying to score early\nBut maintain your shape right you've got to do both you can't you can't just be stagnant and be organized and knock it after it and you can't just good after it and not be organize you got to find a balance between the two and tonight against this team we can find that balance so we're not going to get pulled all over the floods are final case for the match score really\nGonna change you know what what happens when you play these type of teams true is when when you don't score and you don't find your way and they begin to feel a little bit confident with how they're going and how the game's going into more confidence at Tulsa feels\nThe the more likely they will be able to find a way later in the game so we got to find [noise] gotta be able to treat those chances and we've got to find the guy that can put that one away and then the guys will breathe easier forum and we could see four or five [noise] got to get the
