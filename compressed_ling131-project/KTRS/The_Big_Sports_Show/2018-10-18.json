I mean ... not a defensive guy while back checking and where's the defence when I\nI don't ah I don't get it and again critical Canadian trip here forward the blues\nAnd and then after that I'm ... I'm telling ya we he continues to trend in this direction and God Forbid you like to have a wind this trip that the pressure it's just\nIt and I'm not saying it's right I I I think the NHL\nAnd their practice and again it's not new but then again there their practices of just bouncing coaches a weaker you know a few weeks into the season it won't won't be the first time it happened and it probably will happen somewhere in the NHL this year\nPlus at three shots that period not great not not really good but it's a\n... and ... you know what it and we're we're we're writing them off year of this trip is the first period I got a lot of ... a long way to go but\nOff year of this trip is the first period I got a lot of oil a long way to go but at the game didn't start out great for the note one zero they're getting ready to start on the second period\nAnd now see X. game five going on right now and it looks like the Dodgers are gonna go up three games to two is the series will shift back to Milwaukee it's five one in the top of the eighth inning Milwaukee started um\nThe ah the Harry lefty he got the call that a ... he went assertive than any excuse me David go a thirty minute he walked the first as a matter and he was lifted Brandon Woodrow from their went five and a third strike at eight these two teams emptied out the ... last night and\nUm Milwaukee I guess figured this was the way to go because Miley is going to come back and start getting six\nSo he threw a few pitches he's going to be back as the series will shift to Milwaukee it looks like the Dodgers got to be up\nBut the headline from the series is is you know last night this many Machado deal as he uh you know ran into\nA he's exactly are they are at first base and I think coming out of this the ... and the reaction from uh from Christian yell at traders having to bring up this caught a from a the brewers star on what many Machado did\n[noise]\n\n\n... the gist of it they're dirty play by a dirty player Colleen out Manny Machado for being a dirty player do you think that's going to uh people are gonna especially the Dodgers somehow get ... maybe he goes on and has a huge World Series at a pretty good playoff so far at the plate\nMaybe the Dodgers go on he has a huge World Series and and your cash in on that but that's not a good look for somebody is getting getting ready to hit the free agent market and and seemingly ready to cash in a big a big payday\nThis probably won't scare teams away but I think it could scare some fan base was away from truly wanting an embracing a player who's really talented but you see you see all the slides he had what was that game a game three for those slides a dress weren't necessary in trying to break up a double play that look childish grabbing someone knee and what he did last night\nAre you in the queue here for for another three years I only because we don't we don't have this precedent of the cardinals doing that I I Want to see\nThem maybe for again for one off season act like they're the red Sox are the Dodgers because they've got the wherewithal to do it and throw caution to the wind we all want him to do that but there's no record of them actually doing it\nThere was a way to restructure the contract like in the NFL that'd be perfect [laughter] or or\nJust take the old NFL model in touch yeah you're not getting paid [noise] uh but uh that that ship has sailed for now you won the next time the baseball um\nLabor agreement comes up there and I'm telling you what we're ... we've heard Armageddon get thrown around we we hear that thrown around a little to lose sleep but the fact that the players\nYou know the players have the guaranteed contracts you know compared to the NFL but the fact that now we're seeing this shift where players you know they come up ... for the most part players come up they make their debut and they're not all Bryce Harper coming up and ... age Nineteen\nPlayers come up age twenty three probably on average room for a good player\nThey're hitting free agency at age thirty they're they're they're they're paying day isn't going to be there because teams aren't signing thirty year olds to big free agent contract so how do you\nRealistically fix that so players maybe they maybe they hit free agency later but then what ... what is the\nMotivation for teams to have young players only to see in three years later go often signed with the Yankees are Dodgers there's\nTo me Josh Donald as a perfect example he ... I don't believe he ever signed a big contract with trauma unless I'm forgetting but I think he\nWas a very clubs ... it was a long term ... but it was very club friendly\nYeah I don't to me he didn't fully grasp the value that he has in his prime and look at him now he's he's not even by almost a third of the player he used to be or how the ...\nThere are a lot of guys that are going to fall into that category and then you write Donaldson is a is a perfect example of that I'm Still coming up here the rest of the show Rob range is going to join us next in line and we'll talk more about uh\nAbout Rob's take from from what he heard yesterday and he's got some great thoughts on again this coaching staff it is\nA it is in flux right now Jose oh can do a heading back to Florida and he is certainly his presence will be missed on this ball club and we'll talk to them as do football with our good friend Chris Serino we haven't had a chance to catch up with Chris so far this season will do that\nYou know we haven't had a chance to catch up with Chris so far this season will do that\nLater on in the hour as well you had to dismiss Fifteen\nI'm actually starting to get more and more competent zoos gonna win this gene and maybe winning going away on Saturday but there are still a lot of elements it's going to make the skiing during tricky we'll talk about that coming up as well it's a big sports show Britain we see on the big five fifty T.

pleased to welcome on one of the great friends to the show from the\nAs the sports page to Rob range Rob good evening sir how are you\nI'm Brandt appreciate making the time and are you in the family are heading out west to Boise to do it it'd be Jay and cheering and and the family out there are certainly a send our best wishes is are you guys getting ready for a for a nice week out there\nWas really follow is always good to see the kids were so you're closer but always when we get together\nNo question about it I'm Rob we we got to kind of finally closes the book on the twenty teens seizing yesterday for the cardinals in general they liked visited with a with us for\nFor about an hour I guess before we get to some of the takeaways themselves in general comments I guess the big news is that who's that we can do is is heading back to Florida oh what what do you think there are some of the ramifications of this move\nWhy were you know two of them already it was a war or how third minute by minute of the bench coach so those I think a law well deserved more has a long history of managing the minor leagues and\nWhen you're a minority parents are almost all cases you're also coach you are very so not a new position for him by any chance of having spent the last part of of both remember he fell down\nOn the staff after a crystal Oreos was fired and they moved to a couple of years ago they are they moved my show to prove that role you know who have a third base coach hero so powerful than that and I feel that also of course the second half of this is a\nLittle familiar with the big leagues I think for him but I was seeing those characters cautious her so I think that's that's a good move and then all the way that none of my shows no showed it for years of my show was actually the scout this draft assigned\nTo the organization what he was kept coming out of college you know several years ago so\nThey've had a long history together after work well together so both of those I think are are positive most obviously oh can do is there's a loss to the to the artist shows as supposed to talk about but not big at the level that you know it's nice to have his pulse of what's going on I mean there's all this you know he has\nFailed out of here as always has feels a lot of people on this club is going to be talking on a regular basis of watching the games are so many and put that the same time now will be able to help some of the online earlier so not not as if he's worried organizations just they don't transfer to another role not really a surprise\n[laughter] and Rob you've got a piece up on that are on the sports page right now I'm Talking about these coach he moves around the defense obviously still wasn't falling\nGreat last year ... is there a chance we overrated Jose's effect on on on one he can and what he can still do to help the defense\nOut that's his work with guys go repetitious and stuff like that it can help with my position I\nKind of how to play different hours I think he was a big airport on all the young and I were kind of position himself took advantage of his strengths and his ranger their lack of raise this other areas they're going to have a great coach feels like you're ... you're told me one time last year we were talking about there and watch all cultures and\nYou know who to coach the coaches and as a war they said was the coach they literally blazed standing in the bath ... feet when he was reading other charities they looked at a third base coach gets that guy's a look at me I Can't help it out\nYou know if it's the same thing you know what's out there to fill out a lot out there with it you know it's got to make the points out so it's a it's still up to the players the oil fields but to actually too closely to something like that and so I\nThink that's all their priority but you know at what cost of a oh we've also you know realize that there's still\nSome officers shortcomings or this or add up to that you're gonna have to address so it's it's always a\nSexual ... you know which way that we kind of approach um it's it was interesting to see what they do\nAnd we're we're still a little ways away you know were removed from this move coming down but when the cardinals named she'll manager when they didn't Rob where were you on board with the timing in and do you think that some move [laughter] still looks pretty sound right now is we're going to get a few extra moved from the season\nNever know what's gonna happen Scott always talked to people always go to the grocery [laughter]\nVery interesting is knows we talked about yesterday with their ... their way out a couple of things to see if they all started clapped does good you know in the mix for somebody who's basically measure openings or else they'll be all the coaching staff here and if if he does get a job somewhere else and that opens up a couple of jobs we'd all the ... job is going to be open obviously because of that\nIraq is definitely in the next for the job ... job which is open with their maps\nSo if that happens that are looking for a new director ... ... it could be a lot of lot of moving parts your a story forward they're always going to keep our ah our nose to the ground and see what we find out no question\nAbout Rob thanks so much as always safe travels out west look forward

fans or or maybe maybe ... to be getting out of this gauntlet of of a number two in the country Georgia on the road South Carolina and then on the road number one\nAlabama I Know I Know we're all disappointed that means you couldn't come away with a winning that stretch Chris what what do you see during this runs for the tigers and again we knew would be there to stretch of the season\nRight stretch of the sky anyone's\nAdmission certainly would have told you that one we scams whenever the sky but really the most disappointing was one of the middle right off the Carolina and and you know for a couple of reasons obviously as you mentioned George or a number to\nAlabama still number one another's really figured it'd be difficult and you know South Carolina before the season I thought that will be a hard game from Missouri to win and\nYou know things unfolded during the ... are they still be a challenge to get it done there but when you\nRealize that I had a quarterback albeit a senior making his first start factor game Cox did not look as good as I think many of us thought they'd be that was one Missouri really let get away and certainly in the game let get away when they had such a big lead and just made so many mistakes and [noise]\nI guess when I take away as was just had a couple of really difficult quarter is the\nThird quarter against South Carolina when they were out scored Seventeen nothing on the second quarter in Alabama when they're out scored Seventeen nothing you can afford to do that to give up such a point\nBut scored Seventeen nothing so [noise] you know you\nCan't afford to do that to give up such a run of points against a worthy opponent and I know coach on him was preached a lot about other much more competitive than they were last year in games against a\nGeorgian Caroline and he was he is right I just know that they've got to get back to the wing town really starting to Saturday with Memphis or else things are going to get interesting maybe doing interesting down the stretch that they've lost all your three in a row there's not a whole lot of margin for error against uh [noise] you know some teams that they should be able to handle not to Memphis is\nA terrible by any means I have done very well but Missouri has nearly a double digit favorite at home I'm home going needs to win that game\nYeah no question about it you know it's funny we looked at this October stretch who used to be difficult but I think we almost had this vision of okay later on year the schedule lighten up a little bit and certainly compared to plead George in Alabama would but now after watching some teams and\nAnd even then you know even the Arkansas game and then in in you obviously need to read all these improved the season's going on they've been able to score some points Tennessee\nHe just wanted Auburn obviously Florida has scored a couple of big wins already deems that we might be more manageable manageable for nuclear suddenly looks a lot more daunting and it's tough to really pinpoint a game you say oh they absolutely are when there aren't any of those in the winds are there right now\nNo there really aren't and and they really begins of Memphis too I thought oh alone would be a challenging game 'cause they've been a good team certainly American Conference and I just thought it was a dangerous game because you naturally\nWould exhale after the stretch of Georgia South Carolina Alabama you come home and non conference game it's oncoming only they have better be ready in Missouri and sharp because Memphis there's a great running back barrel Henderson leaving the country and rushing in\nMemphis is you know Brandon nearly knocked off central Florida which would have been that schools first laws and a couple years they let in most of the day Memphis and lost by one point in the end so tough and then he got Kentucky you know\nFive and a one should be banned due to go six in ... Florida who's already six and won and Vanderbilt always plays a defensive team and [noise] you know you mentioned the other is kind of see awful when at Auburn\nArkansas really scoring ... points even though it's losing some game so I certainly think there are more wins out their forms or I definitely believe that was you know six games down and six to go but clearly the second half of a schedule I think right now is when you visit a look for more daunting than originally I Would have certainly before the season early in the season\nNo question about of Christian with us here in the big the\nCPR is Christmas drew locked obviously all of the lofty expectations even talk of buy in trophy candidacy that's obviously now feeding into the background can we tribute\nUh a lot of his struggle to not ... uh obviously you begin to em in Georgia and the rain in South Carolina\nThere there are some built in excuse there what do you do you feel this runs any deeper with him a you know maybe some struggle mentioned it last week some struggles running the or another new off for him this year under daring dueling\nWas a transition time but\nYou know I Know cruise not one to want to make excuses and I'll be honest and I think he would admit this to me he's got to play better you know from Missouri to win games especially close games as we think a lot of them could be here in the final half of the season he really has got to be\nBetter and you've got to have your best players play well [noise] I think he's been a little bit again you look at the competition you have to take that into account I Do think the manual absence is significant I really do believe that he certainly had been the tigers big\nDeep his numbers are still pretty well among the receivers if you look at it and of course he went out and play three games now so I Do think they had something good going there the young guys a freshmen have stepped up a bit especially\nIn the Knox but that is a big loss or you know maybe bigger than I even realized a few weeks ago when I first started missing some time assault [noise] a lot goes into it but but drew needs to and I think a man and and probably will play better

mark release in\nHis home country season is just getting ready to stored and he's going to be going into it in a pretty fine form Jay after after winning mushy and be classic uh in Malaysia by a whopping five short margin markedly shrimp very talented player\nI had a discussion with my sister out at Normandy today about the fact that the Leishman is one of the without question I think one of the five best players without a major championship but it's playing this game now it's almost surprising\nThat he does win a little bit more I mean he just put on a clinic\nBut he doesn't win a little bit more I mean he just put on a clinic in Kuala Lumpur I'm just fantastic stuff uh he he really took control of the golf tournament a never look back\nAnd he's got a couple of aspects to his game\nThat really impressed me a very accurate or if the tea uh and when he gets that part or going\nUh he's awfully tough to beat him and on top of the ... he's an extremely nice guy uh people like him a people in the business life can be a he certainly is a wonderful ambassador for this for the Gulf\nAnd the other thing that it does talk back get ready to go day is his homeland would that lead that last triple events that they've got a ...\n... it also sets him apart on the president's\nAh you know he that's come up but you know we talked about the fact that um that you've got the situation where I'm In the U.S has been scrutinized or what it's done internationally so that you know another boost for an international team ...\nOn a good point you bring up the J uh he'll be tough for especially down in uh in his home country uh and you know just on a personal note if I\nHad the ability to take Jay Randolph junior or with the passion that I Know that you have for this board or any place on this job I Would take you to Melbourne, Australia a and I would introduce you to five\nThe injury situation and and how it you know and how great a tournament the PGA was in itself but he ... he ... he used to play earlier\nAnd the stuff that just jumps up to pay to the media or J. sixty two and a half percent of its drives over three hundred yards the tour average\nIs two eighty six you start giving up fourteen Fifteen twenty yards\nTo fellow competitors a boy yeah yeah you you you know that better than anybody would you know twenty yards a conservatively vets to clubs different to you know I'm going to hit in Asia and you're going to hit a six and you're going to try and be me I don't think so\nWell you know we were talking earlier about mark ... maybe being one of the top five players or the ... to win a major and and I'm not gonna put ... sleight of these guys met could sure and and Lee Westwood in this category I think there there\nMay be passed that I'd love to see one of them and when one I don't think was the has any chance culture may still have a chance to Bob\nMy top flat five players that have yet to win a major that are playing current late on the PGA Tour or at least ... absolutely I think he got to consider Paul Casey a with the talent that he has the fact the has the one one\nI'm going to go with a young guy and it's just because of what he's shown so far less pure talent in John around I think you have to consider John rom I think a while ago I might have considered that decade not see 'em all\nIn all this Rosa we're here for a decade subtle name at ... the guy to type reports that the British Open that we don't see maybe as much as the euro's do and that's the guy from ... brand battle oh I'm so those are my top five that have yet to win one\nA pretty impressive list that we agree a little bit uh I certainly go with Paul Casey uh watching\nHim in in France performance at the Ryder Cup by sorting through Z as an eyesore desire to uh to even go higher in the world looked golf and\nHe has all the tools necessary to win a major championship I think he's going to get the job done I'm not jumping off the future bandwagon quite yet\nUh this may be the last year that I put in there a given more and more run it and uh probably the name\nA couple of named to maybe you're going to surprise you where I differ from from Europe pigs Gary Woodland a seems to be just gaining a little traction\nUh another guy a form of FedEx up one branch genetic or he pots well enough or certainly the get the job done uh and now a\nJust to keep it up by going with a youngster well\nI'm going to have to go with Tommy fleet would an eyesore Tommy flee would\nA ... so what he did in the final round there at the U.S open I saw him team up with Mullen Ari at the Ryder Cup I don't see any gaping holes in the in the game of Tommy Lee would uh so uh that that certainly would would be my top five\nA and Leishman\nWould be my top five or ... and ... a mention his name but you you mentioned it to a I think a ... you know he is you know for quip men are his arsenal to uh to get the job done\nAnd the guy the guy that neither one of us mentioned just because we probably already been that way as a major champion ... obviously is one of the players Ricky sour Bob ... do you have to win a major\nUh it's pretty incredible stuff\nUh the big question is

joining us rather timely because news just reached the grill room about the retirement of Johnny Miller first I Want your thoughts on John his career and\nJohnny Miller first don't want your thoughts on Johnny's career and then and now that he's hanging him up what are you thinking\nPlot you know one thing is is he changed the landscape in um announcers and helicopters approached golf he never backed down he always had an opinion you may not have always agreed with his opinion\nBut he had an opinion and that was so contrary watch to anybody else I mean prior to that the only time I remember anybody saying anything negative was was actually just a Jack Nicklaus was in the booth when John ... was in the playoffs at the old course at St Andrew's for the open championship and\nDecided to hit driver at Seventeen and Jack was questioning the move and you hit it left into the into the rock but anyways daily eventually one and that was almost like\nA herd of that a player in the booth would question\nSomething that a player on the ground would be doing so it wasn't often that you would see that like Johnny noticed basically spent a career doing that and uh I think that's added or lead to what other people to dial in television that actually probably forced ... out of the booth\nAt CBS because he was unwilling to be critical of the players on the ground because he was out like that was not what he should be doing and so I think ... did a great job and I think it really made a difference for NBC who was\nLet's be honest bothering me to go back to the old days but I wouldn't say NBC was necessarily the or the behemoth in covering golf I think it was really CBS I think with Johnny Miller they made a separation that they hadn't made before\nAnd I've seen a lot to do with the fact that the listeners\nA very comfortable uh Gary coke or Roger ... be a Dan Hicks I mean when you turn on your TV Saturday Sunday you are hearing familiar voices that you really I'd gotten the trust over the years so it made their appeal even greater\nRight I think that you know one of the things that if you were in a team sport one of the things that you look at\nIs that that player makes the other players better and I think in Chinese Casey made as you said the other players that are larger mouthpiece that Gary Cokes a all the people that came on board I mean I was obviously\nI have a relationship going way back when with golf dot com where you know we went out of the relationship with NBC Sports I'd be in those meetings with people like Johnny and Roger and actually even Dave Marr\nAnd um you know it was it was it was fascinating on how they approach things out there but the central comedy writers the executive producer has been there or the producer now I should say who's been there forever and so he's been there with\nJohn Miller through most of it and I I just think that they were better product because of Johnny Miller and and if it's all is true which you know I've seen many different reports\nThat Paul Asian or it's going to take over for Johnny ... which I I find a little hard to believe because I Can't believe Paul wants to be on the road that much but if he is he's going to be a great addition to\nA a good team but as Jon Miller leaves you're going to start seeing that team split up you're going to see Roger malt the not get it and do another contract I'm almost positive that you're going to see Gary coke on his last contract so you start seeing\nThese guys Peter Jacobson you're going to start seeing these guys move away and so it's going to be a new it's got to be a new team I'm within the next five years I Would think\nOh I'm doing here it is just the front runner from all the reports that\nWe have heard although it was just a couple of months ago that the idea of that David Duvall a was being groomed to take over for John Miller and he's inside scoop on um what happened with that or or were those rumors are premature\nShe made when he went on a week ago after being whistled for the targeting totally ... did you guys have a message for him\nFor interest to them no word on a on a I'm going to go in and do what we came here to do was\nOnly ... the guy that you've known for a long long time he's running back in Memphis ... foot high school together Melrose closer to you and what makes him such a great front of your\nLife\nWhat
