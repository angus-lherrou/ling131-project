South Carolina off tense\nIn check and they're not even going to get the full strength gain Cox off and see that they've got some they've got some injuries that they're dealing with ... on that side you've got receiver portray Smith is out one of their safety says out a day out of defensive in\nUm DJ wanna who's not supposed to play with a foot injury um and then they also have some some other guys who are probable they got a linebacker at tied in um you have some multiple guys who are banged up for this for the south Carolina team in that's a part of the game now Missouri's got some guys who are who are beaten up they're maintained relative health\nAnd and what is he a man as a count as a age of twelve I Believe and I think you only missed maybe to field goals all last year but but I'm I'm Talking more about you know the real meat and potatoes of your special teams\nKick returns and kick coverage and I I really hope in this in this by week which we were really haven't talked about I I'm not really certain what to expect on a Saturday quiet\nAnd I'll tell you this protein has got to\nAn all American caliber punter and then all conference caliber kicker and with Barry owed them\nPounding this constantly where the margin of error is razor thin he'll say that every week and he's right but if the if the if that is the case you're special teams is the is the difference in that more times than not if you're special teams is garbage that margin of error is razor thin you're going to lose a lot of games\nI'll and also at and that this is the first year they've had a coach specifically devoted to special teams in Andy hill so that excuses out the window and now with other excuses about to go out the window because we're ... who is the ... turn man that the tigers would like to have his back him um he had been he had been slow it with a\nWith a with an injury and its foot they don't know if he's going to be available Saturday but he's working toward that and that would be the guy that you probably have returning\nA punching kicks I Would think um so if he's back and complain then now you have the guy to what's there will be fewer and fewer excuses when you have a guy that you mark earmarked for your returns and all of a sudden these entered that's tough\nUm they should have somebody else you can put back there but a ... foot she'll be back soon and that should make a difference so you're right at the by week there's not going to be another week to focus on showing things up on special teams I'm hopefully that blocked pond was something that they spend a lot of time on because\nThat remains to me one of the most confusing plays I've seen a long time was when three guys get through a line and you have you have the pledge the basically the protection unit set up between the put her on the line and no one saw three guys coming off the edge\nAt that point do you think you're playing against whom and how many as you think they think are on the field of three are on account for that one that won stumped me you know you're right they can't if you're gonna win if you're going to be more than seven one team and this conference you have to what what are we see Alabama do\nAnd what do we see Georgia do the reason I say George reminds me of Alabama's cause they're finding a way to win games\nOn those on those ... margins they're finding ways to win games by stripping un returning it not just dripping you but returning it for a touchdown after they do that for any way to to win a game of blocking and not just black me upon by picking it up and scoring there so far ahead in those areas or other teams let their guard down\nAnd they've got all these young players who are trying to prove they deserve to be on the ... special teams and that's when you know you've got to roll and when you're special teams\nIn the office depot ... special teams and that's when you know you've got to roll and when you're special teams units are full of hungry guys are going out there to make a play not guys who were going out there thinking okay this is just what we got to get over with or get back to ...\nWith George is able to do against Missy

I. so pleased to be joined by their head coach of your Missouri daggers coach barrier them coach thanks as always for the time sir how are you\nI'm good man thanks for having me on I I appreciate the opportunity\nHas always sir and um let's let's kind of look back coaches as you guys that as a ... you had some time to look over this film from the Georgia game which stood out to you what was good maybe what a stood out that you needed to work on\nWell there's there's a number of things and then you take the opportunity um [noise] after after any game\nOn and on and they always make corrections on on the good that you did learn from it the bad that you did and then they'll make sure that you don't have those errors again and learn from it and then move forward and you get onto the next one so [noise]\nUh same approach for us ... says rode on the the previous three weeks before Georgia and they were told her ability to run the really helped us in the gangs [noise]\nUm some some self inflicted and errors probably cost us like it's a really good team\nCould walk away from it near you don't turn over the ball three different times you get a ... for a touchdown a you're not going to win a game when when you have those action on on your side of things and much less\nA number two team in the country but\nYou look at the things that we did well all those things are negatively but in the fourth quarter to eleven point game we've got the ball or drive and I know we could make enough place and credit to them that is a nice job on on overcoming those things so [noise] um [noise]\nIt was a great opportunity for us in a number of ways to\nGet a little rest and he'll up but also get a jump on South Carolina get on the road recruiting and you know in a Justin and really do have the self scout and analysis on where we are after four games and the other team in our program got better over the week\nOur team handling very mature way on on their approach and I know they're excited and have an opportunity to go play against [noise]\nCoach ... ... is it a evidence you that the running game is steadily improved from week one through week for against Georgia you mentioned it it it looks to be something that's that's really been a positive lately\nBut it's got to be it's got to be in our favor we got to find ways to run the ball because we can't we can't rely on drew having to make every through it's just that's not a smart football so we also understand on the stretcher and and SEC play\nUh the imports run in the ... and also the ability to be able to do that is you know it's going to be I'm going to be tough shortage bad times but we gotta stick to it we've got to find ways to come out of clay to to be able to run the ball and then stick a time to shelve it all on 'em and the second six\nDollars an hour on a forty arch such that's all that bad now we've got to find ways to move the six men\nGet to a third manageable amount or we can go convert to third like you could drive going so our staff was on some nice things on on that side of the law on on finding ways to run the ball I like her off the wind the way that they're coming together and playing and then we got three backs that that are a little bit of a different pace all three of them\nBut also that valuable and our playing ball\nCoach you you mentioned some of the mistakes throughout the course of the game what what's the message to the kids when when ... when when those mistakes pop up about ... what is your message to them or the ... in terms of the week after a\nMatch six in a row in the second half this year\nAs not going to happen this year but how but I don't think by hand they turn that corner like they did last\nYear I don't think they can score that average that many points threats of their schedule a because they've got a ton of games left 'em and beef that three as of now you've got three ranked teams\nOn that schedule I I don't think it I don't think they're going to necessarily have necessarily means that they're gonna have a worst record but\nI don't think they're going to put up as many points\nAnd that can be even a good thing because we talked about this off as being more balanced they don't need to score they should not need to score that many points to win games um that's the that was the whole point of the day or two we hire was to have it all things that didn't\nJust tire out the defense but help that and are we still have we haven't seen the defense take reap the dividends of that of that approach yet but I Do think the up and says getting to a couple more balance the defense needs to do its part so I don't think they're going to scores may point to the dead after the by last season\nBut you know a couple of weeks ago been proved you were talking about you know moving a clock and in in ruling\nBasically a clock and that time of possession a\nFrom that perspective I'm the office this year because they're running the ball with more success just move the change you don't have to have that Seventy three are\nYou know pass and catch or whatever if it's a eight nine ten play drive for fifty for fifty Seventy five yards whatever the case but you're moving the clock you're kind of managing things better and I think in that regard they are stronger\nYou know to me this is really as much of a question about the defense 'cause I think we're all agree we can't expect Missouri a score as many points\nAfter the by as you mentioned Britain but to me that's that's okay it could even be better if the defense does its job that the ... more balance now because it was supposed to make the defense stronger it was supposed to give the defense of chance to get off the field is supposed to give the if it's a chance to to be more stout in so far\nWe haven't really seen that yet but the authenticity eating more clock it is staying on the field ... doing the things that was supposed to help the defense and the different so far as underperform so can that improve if that can on the fence can keep doing its job than I think you're talking about I think you're talking about a finished that Missouri fans will be happy with if not\nThen it might have wondered why if if it would have been better to stay with up tempo and and and say let's go let's ends everything on the fence but I I have I've been a little disappointed with the decent so far I did think it looked better against Georgia to me after the by week is a chance to really the last chance so you have\nTo get fundamental changes made and it's time to see what they came up with\nWell there's no question about it fell is is that a lot of the questions were asking about in the suit they're asking the same thing on the other side of the country in South Carolina about their game Cox\nUh both off ants in defense and our second number is minus four\nThat's the turnover differential with getting caught game Cox right now I'm a zoos minus one but for South Carolina I'm a ... a team that especially with will will must champions or coach machines never been known to have a really off ... inclined team it's more about\nSuffocating defense\nTurnover setting up short fields and that has not been the case for South Carolina so far if that remains the case guys\nI think was who's got an excellent chance to do some damage against South Carolina again the tigers coming to this is again by the by week tigers coming off all by South Carolina coming off\nA really hard fought physical loss\nTo Kentucky I think another edge going there to the tigers won the zoo could work on their deficiencies South Carolina's had to sort of limped into this match if you're talking about injuries they're dealing with to ban a but that negative for to me really really stands out because I I that's\nThat tells me they're not living up to their usual identity at least an identity for will machine football the foot\nStarts with Jake Bailey the quarterback he's a junior now he's supposed to be one of the faces of this conference on the quarterback position he's got seven touchdowns he's got six pigs\nUm that's not what you want to see from up from a junior who has the experience so I think that's a key to this can can you can you keep that trend rolling I'm you know we talk about the injuries South Carolina has Missouri seems to be a little bit healthier spot at all can prove that he's ready to go another guy\nThat we we should mention here's camp Hilton defensive back from the St Louis area he's playing with a boat broken bone in his hand he had surgery to get it repaired but he's probably going to be wearing what looks like a a some sort of American gladiator club on his one of his one of his paws on this game again but um I don't know that he'll be picking off and he passed with one hand\nBut he didn't didn't scout team recently so maybe you can but they got to try to keep that trend go on the defensive back so they could come up with a big play I think that would go far in this game because Jake Bentley has proven that he'll put the ball at risk so far the season\nWas South Carolina and eroded Kentucky last week you know what Kentucky was a lot more physical team than the game Cox and in Brennan ... years saying we'll must ship was not happy with that plus the fact they turned it over four times\nThat's just not as such so you'd almost think that even though they didn't have the by week they only have ... you know of a few days to to\nPrepare for the Missouri Tigers um but they are geared to you that concentration ah ... the physicality\nAnd then you know a cleaning it up to with a loving penalties my mind and then there to\nYou can get up to with a ... mile wide and then the turnovers\nYou got to make them you got to make that they try to put it in the air where he seems to be vulnerable there I Would think that South Carolina's going to want to try to run their running back douty he's ... he's got\nAlready got two touchdowns this year he's he's he's carrying it fifty five times for two hundred Seventy nine yards he's basically got Larry round treat type numbers and South Carolina confined success on the ground they might want to have\nYou know objectively not throw it as much a Missouri is acceptable through the air so far that we've seen so I think to to me it starts with stopped in the run and then it starts with when you do make 'em go through there you got to give a better if it's a performance and you have so far this season if you do that\nAnd the often gets going than ah than I think this is again Missouri can and should win I Know that the dog I Know they're on the road but to me this is a very big game and their season um when I look at how potent I think Kentucky is going to be\nThis this to me decides if you're going to be a whole team in the SEC Easter if you're going to be in that second year behind Georgia they're there to really gains are going to decide that depending on what you think of Florida um and it's Kentucky now in South Carolina and you probably have a better chance of beating South Carolina right now they do Kentucky\nTrent Fredrickson Jim

C. road game level o'clock tomorrow morning our time and will lead to you know that um we have the misery games you're on the big five fifty\nI'm here in the in the St Louis area football as well as basketball with my Chilean Howard Richardson for our listeners back here willy\nWill remind them again that's another collect kick them out of collect pregame the love of the ... the kickoff from Columbia South Carolina\nWilly this uh last week I'm going to Kentucky being beaten by a team that most people who are on each other you know there's right away they can talk to you this because Lincoln basketball hoops and what have you but\nUm they have done very well and they certainly took care of business is against the game box last week\nI got a chance to pay for and watch fair fair game against your faith I had a feeling that might happen there might be concerned about the real issue here you know court Twenty one court\nCourt corner wander quarter for fourth of the federal court in South Carolina the for the job of shutting them out in the second half of the office never get anything going to affect me right now are probably you probably have to say at this moment as change the proper second favorite they\nReally did they use a ... for whatever reason was due in South Carolina gets together it it always seems to be a very critical game what what do you think\nFor for this Saturday a for tomorrow's game what do you think some of the key matchups aren't as the tankers bring a is certainly on paper and one of the more potent Boston says in the lead to Columbia South Carolina\nAs I'm sure you remember of\nActually Missouri was a dominating South Carolina last year at Colorado Missouri people federal kickoff return got to turn things around but before that you know it looked like Missouri was going to have their way without throw out of\nIt as much as I everybody talked about here and I guess both teams really tell the wide receiver I think the key for South Carolina for the fan able to run the especially now that a family is going to play is Philip\nWe'll run the ball especially now that uh whether or not Jake Bentley is going to play it still up and they're probably going to be a game plan emphasis and although he did practice today\nBut uh you know I think they're building a round up all this is going to be you know he did a really good job against that against against Vanderbilt and they did it they were doing a decent job of it against Kentucky until they got so far up you know so they got so far behind ... [noise]\nBut ah I think that's going to be the biggest thing and then on on a ... as far as defense is concerned uh\nSouth a soft oh what a safer than they've had they've had a tough time at stopping stop at the path to soften\nThe wrong costs when you're most of that was against Georgia obviously and Kentucky last week so it was a pretty good teams but uh [noise] I think the deepest us not to step up from the beginning and I'm not just be solid and the second half they are safe and the real strong in the second apple at the last two games Kentucky and so\nAnd if it were say pretty much shut down the senators and the third and fourth quarter but um it got to find a way to get out you know the get out of the shooting a little bit a little bit faster on that side of the ball\nSo Willie Smith he covers the game collection he's been with those before the segment of the week all behind enemy lines are so it's like we're going in and and and to use that give us some of the above maybe\nOne or the game you're going to have to do just as well as the Missouri Tigers I'm curious as you watch\nThe flash bulb with this team and in some ways taking some pressure of everyone else by saying I can carry this I can be I can be a voice I can be our face and everyone else who just doing what they do and he's he's a face and he's OK with that um you've had a fascinating match up with mark stoops and a versus a his old his old boss\nAnd a and I think that I think you just have Kentucky in a better spot that ride not\nEverybody is starting to realize who they are\nAnd then you have down at Texas a and M. you've got to the sky high expectations they started three into jumbo fish has been in hot water a weekly grabbed a player by a face masks and gave his neck a little the little jerk and then kind of tried to\nKind of sort of maybe apologize for it but not really and\nIt's been a bad look so you know what that's my pick this week I got 'em at six\nSix point dog I'm going to take Kentucky I've been riding them all season I'm not ready to give up on them\nYou know in men's already given up his upset to upgrade their right out of boxing gym and he's he's got thrown in jail for holder stole it from um\nAlabama is at Arkansas guys I'm not even sure it's worth going to deep peer ban is favored by thirty five in Fayetteville I Will say Arkansas has better um\nIt's always interesting to watch bam a in a in a huge spread like that they have trouble covering because they they have a monster spread every week thirty five and north\nUm obviously Arkansas has got not going to win but it would be interesting to see what their chances are of covering that line\nOnly quarterback ... only interesting thing there is a jail it hurts to play last week so everyone hold him that he would take the red shirt route and transfer I'm no dice but he is could still transfer next season he can graduate remember he's just a junior but he could graduate and be on the market I mentioned that because\nThere are some people who think cost me cough in Missouri should be the market for grad transfer quarterback this off season\nUm LSU Florida underrated rivalry here in the FCC and I think again another two teams are owned by Ramsey said that to LSU as kind of you served Auburn into that pecking order in the FCC west and and they really did by by winning that game floor to\nTry and do we talk all about Kentucky Florida saying hey what about us as that second team behind Georgia\nThis is this is to me a real fascinating game because I I\nThink both of these schools have a chance to um to to hang around but you really you really need a winning for Florida this uh this could be the biggest win any brief Florida tenure of Dan mall and then he came off beat in his old team Mississippi State this past weekend Jimmy\nYeah well I'm a I'll tell you what I'm when I'm looking at Auburn at Mississippi State which team was able to show for Mississippi State\nYou know on on Saturday um I I I'm not really certain than you'd mentioned Auburn is gonna maybe being surpassed your by LSU eldest you ride dollars right fifth of the nation you know so uh me you know maybe maybe they\nDo they're overweight that's the thing I was a little overrated easy now and will they be ... I mean to me that to me validation fellas used beat in Florida I I think they are I think they're very overrated\nYeah I think I don't think that I don't think there are that over rated I think we probably under rated them during the season the coach Joe\nHe might sound a little goofy kind of sounds like his voice as a rock Tumblr but uh but those guys blowing through walls for him and all he's done since he's been down there is when I'm always really done his head coach is just as been when so they might be time to ah\nTo start saying hey this isn't divine God this is who else who is this is another chance for them to prove that I Will say this about Florida\nYeah this is who else he was just another chance to prove that I Will say this about Florida\nI think they're getting better and I think Philippe Frank is getting better um he is the heat to me is the key to Florida um if he can be if he can be the player who can beaches potentially quarterback and they're dangerous team he's\nKind of guy who's lost and making mistakes and getting scattered out there than in their ... but I think he's moving in the right direction under Dan Mullen\nBeing in Florida that will make a difference too in Tallahassee\nTwo biggest when's the last week in Ohio State beating Penn State Notre Dame beating stand for the week after\nBuckeyes hosts the Hoosiers Notre Dame is at Virginia Tech either of those teams having made being moved this past week and you think the buckeyes or the Irish are vulnerable this weekend I think the Irish Danny you go to Blacksburg and I don't care what you need to watch the Old Dominion that is a very very tough spot\nFor a Notre Dame to be in coming off that emotional when real dominant when it gets to be in for\nThe folks in us up in a really happy with a big win over Stanley shouldn't you know I absolutely\nThey should I'm not certain I that that's not going to be a pushover though um for the for this week uh for the Irish\nI think you guys do see guys ... role in the interesting enough but again that's what we're seeing notice some\nHistory there with Indiana University\nAt Ohio State\nUh here in the last half a dozen years or so they made the buckeyes won a little bit not that ah you know they've had some kind of five wisdom to roll\nOr whatever the case may be but they have played the buckeyes well\nYeah I'm not I I here yet but I think this Ohio State team\nIs playing with a special kind of fire under it after all it it's been through 'em and I'm not saying that as giving them a pass somebody in praising them but they have turn this into us against the world in urban Meyer is a master motivation these milk in this for for all the work I Will say\nIt's just a matter of time until Notre Dame gets upset I tried to pick 'em to lose early in the season that blew up on my face but every time that you get pumped up a feel good about Notre Dame\nThe carpet comes out from underneath his I'm just warning Notre Dame fans that don't get your hopes up too high too fast because eventually they will let you down and that's that's the game where it happens could be at Virginia Tech\nBen gave it away a few minutes ago he's taken is or his Kentucky Wildcats as his upset pick Jimmy do you have one for the weekend\nYou know what are the only thing that I'm kind of looking at is a Auburn at Mississippi State in in Auburn really to to kind of get maybe right the ship so to speak and it'll be just an upset the well now Auburn favorite\nBy three and a half you have to go Mississippi state as you want to know if you want to upset credit points Jimmy you've got to take the most\nWell let's just say instead of three and a half a suit for to\nBuy it in a roundabout route\nI'm Upset pick on this end of the table after they lose heartbreak or to Clinton I think Syracuse goes to pit and loses the line on that has moved in a very strange manner ... getting points at home it can be the pit Panthers to win straight up\nSyracuse in the ACC on\nSaturday afternoon fellas it's a coming around that time our final segment of the show is not too far away how Richard joins us next and then we'll make our final predictions for the weekend printed we see bent Fredrickson Jim holder it's our kickoff countdown showing the big five fifty [noise]\nThat you've seen them\nYet or\nVolunteering to make a difference [noise]\nWhat you may not know that every two roles is making a profound difference in the lives of the nation they are at ss Melvin ... children's hospital [noise]\nKnights of Columbus developmental center and cardinals Lennon is a leader in early diagnosis and intervention for autism and other neuro developmental disorders\nDonate to the drive for persons with mental disability industries weekend of October\nOr on line and ...\nMake a difference in the life of a child\nT.
