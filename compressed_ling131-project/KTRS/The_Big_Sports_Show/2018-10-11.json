S. L. championship which was ... she is a member of you wants the only one yourself do has just been a long time you come in Germany\nHas um the you know the league and credit to Jake Edwards and an alec and everyone down there in Tampa saint had a vision of what they think you know a lower level soccer and look that's not a fourth at her word right around the world yeah lower\nDivisions are are ... and like everybody around the world that's what they call it and these guys credit to them their vision has been a hundred percent to put together something that's going to have various levels that's going to have\nSupport is going to have opportunities for players and coaches and you know front office people to move up to go start a new project in the new lead to be a part of it so it's great to see it it's just a reason why we're so excited to be a part of the U. S. L. it happens you know since the get go\nOne of the players on march ... not pointing at tonight's game uh this is an interesting story\nBecause I remember your pet very telling me about this not playing tonight to first loving ... British cow Blake leading the league we only does he was searching gold last here you're picked up the ...\nYeah he it's an amazing story I mean you know everything happens for a reason and I'm going to be transparent 'cause that's\nWhat we're told to do in our board of directors and start to damage on what to do is\nWe're looking for one more forward and we had some items you guys and nothing sorted out and it just didn't come to fruition so we do what we always do you reach out agents you call you may call he's not going to like this with Jimmy Nielsen down in Oklahoma City in his system are cowards said\nOh you're looking at these two guys if it was me I take out very well\nThank you mark Howard and Jimmy skills because they told me but that started with ... and that's what we did and um you know ... come in you know from the get go is acclimated himself to the group very very well um you know from his first moment he got into training camp to\nYou know to today he has become like a huge part of it and are really ... the role and the challenge of being a goal scoring and he's done it before in this league in each you know he's been around and he's seen some things so easy brings another level of experience to us and he's been a huge pick up but it's funny how things happened\nIsn't it amazing a gym here and I talk about this all the time during the course of a broadcast Jim some of the other teams around the league or likewise in the eastern conference but FCC Cincinnati twenty three three and seven [noise]\nFrom dirty games on the thirty three play how does that have\nTaken a heck of a roster you know giving credit to Lucas on our technical director and uh\nYou know Alan Alan couch their their head coach I mean they have put together a heck of a roster with players that any team in us we want and um you know and they've they've been through some ups and downs but you know they had been consistent\nEven during those down moments and that's why you said like you said they'd gotten points out of almost every single game a lot of talent or explosives like an interest in different ways and uh you know I haven't watched too much of the eastern conference but when I have and I've seen them learn entertaining to watch\nYou touched upon what am I ... a bit earlier when you said how the league has changed with reference to that\nThere's no comparison when they put a new era of us all started back in Fifteen with right now the play has dramatically improved yeah I mean you look at the the type of players that are here the resources that are going into it where players are coming from\nHow you know how much players want to be a part of this week\nAnd I think that starts you know you have to give credit to the legal question first and foremost to like I said Jake Malik and the people down in Tampa to yourself but then you have to go another layer and you have to give credit to these clocks me not to give credit to clubs that are investing in players putting investment and into their facilities because\nSomeone doesn't come over to the to the U.S to play in a in a second division if they're going to practice in a public\nPark for change in their car it's not going to happen that's not how it's done every anywhere else around the world it's gotta be professional and cut the made that investment in\nThose days of FARC
