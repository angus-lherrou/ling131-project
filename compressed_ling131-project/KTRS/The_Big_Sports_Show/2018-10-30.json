our guest slide and uh I don't know if you if both subscribe\nTo the athletic yet I have for about the last six months or last six months excellent excellent\nA journalism being done over there and a CJ more is with the athletic and he has been writing about in the zoo and Kansas basketball a great piece to date on the zoo freshmen Torrance Watson in CJ joins us live right now you're on the big five fifty years CJ thanks so much for taking a few minutes or how are you\nDoing well thank you for the introduction I should\nSay no problem at all I really appreciate you making the time sir I you know we're\nA it's it's an interesting time for basketball fans because I think a lot of folks are still sort of shell shocked on the ah John take their news from a week ago but uh you know you have a great piece today on on Torrance watching on\nHow he made a you know we might actually be counted on as as you know one of the guys may be a after some time to be a featured store for the team\nYeah definitely I mean when you want to look after um you know I think there are some guys but the bigger question mark whether John McCain was going to or not was who was going to head out such a job that I was\nGoing to be a big part of that you know when I saw them quite a few weeks ago about a month ago don't drop it would take a lot of three and I think he would have been a big part of that but you look at the in the Congo acquiring them you know he likes to really open up a lot of trees so\nThere's really not many sugar scores on the roster as far as remember guys I'm torn about his proven it's as it gets even though you know he's done it at the high school level but man you really really let it out to a level\nYou know he certainly did just right down the road you're the big five fifty over at which shield and the real story in on the wind\nWe'd shield and the real\nStory in on the wind or they're CG and you mentioned in the article in and not that they're the same players blood ... so man so maybe some expectation that Torrance\nCould do symbol or a similar things all sensibly as to caches Robertson last year who was of course the grad transfer from Tunisia\nAnd I brought up that brought that up through a condo and now he's a cleric review them out of him in criminal or when I'm you know character was such a great shooter but he wasn't great about that you think\nUm Torrance can do a little bit more off ... off the mountain and create for themselves but to to expect them to shoot maybe at the level that the cash just did what would be asking a lot of he has such a great season\nNo question about it CJ more is joining us right now your rights were the athletic in a piece earlier today on the zoo freshmen Torrance Watson is a um\nIt's a freshman class CJ that may be lack some of the star power um of of last year I obviously when you're bringing the Puerto brothers are bringing Jeremiah Tillman\nBut ... does does appear to be a group of ... especially in the backwards and on the wings that uh that that kinds of Martin could get some uh immediate dividends and certainly now the fact that you were to transfer his one of them in mark Smith is going to be eligible to go run away\nYeah I think that in March from it is huge because you know obviously you're gonna have to now you're gonna have to start at least one ... won't be that guy that the ... but if you hadn't gotten Margaret you're probably looking at\nTwo freshman the starting lineup on the parameter and and that's just kind of a tough spot it could be and um you know muscles are like five star guy so\nI'm you know I think ... a guy that obviously you know he didn't ... great last year in Illinois but he is he has been in college game he knows what to expect and you expect him to just you know kind of have a sophomore farm so I think giving him of a big physical guard\nA bull really help this team on on both ends\nI don't want to compare the two schools obviously they're on different levels and complements but you know CGI you covered Kansas as well and it's something that bill self has done obviously he's capable of getting a one and done players but he gets\nA you know highly recruiting guide and certainly devine to Graham was in a star studded recoup but I I still at a decent player and a guy that turned out to be a tremendous asset to Kansas State for years there in Lawrence um it it can sort of describe the importance of a school like ... do\nHey man thanks so much for the time I look forward to catching up again soon after\nYou got to that CJ more with us or writes for the athletic and check out his piece on the athletic today or if you're not not again not to do a live spot here for the athletic but it is great and great writing and if you love\nYour love sports they do a tremendous job and a ... and CJ covers the tigers in Missouri basketball in Torrance Watson here's a guy that the ... and it talks about it in his piece today he really could be the face\nAnd for me to basketball or something that towards it sort of that was one of his goals to be\nThe face of Missouri basketball and he's not that far away from a from accomplishing that seat she is she's in he's in range and he's\nGoing to be a guy I think that touches the ball a lot I think it was going to have the ball in his hands all the time if you were self she was that again as I stated he wasn't gonna score Eighteen Nineteen game is good for twelve or Thirteen with a bunch of rebounds bunch of his stuff in the statute that guy now doesn't exist form a zoo\nBut towards Watson she is if he's as good as you advertise could touch it and shoot it you know maybe Fifteen times again\n... double digits scoring and B that perimeter threat that ... going to want that he's gonna want the three point shot drunk guys could stroke it last year\nBut there isn't a lot coming back that you can count on from the perimeter that's why with John take going down you immediately you're looking and you say who do you point to an end and mark Smith\nThere can be there's a lot of expectations there's a lot of hope and mark Smith was a disappointment in Illinois last year I just the way it is hopefully hopefully he can blossom in ...\nBut I don't know he's ... he's on a bigger a a a a better backed Denmark Smith, Andrew Smith looks like he's not going to be eligible that's looks like it's the story right now is Evansville doesn't want to play ball\nThat's fine but\nAt some point you're going to need somebody to step up and that backward and hopefully towards Watson is that guy

Twenty one Seventeen set up them and dismiss this week I mean once you get you knew that was going to be the best game of the night and sure enough it absolutely played out to be\nAnd how by pat and they're going back to last year gp where they were seemingly the underdog once they got to the district finals seemingly the underdog every single week in their match up and they do come all the way to the sea championship and they're still winning close games a year later\nAnd they're going to be the underdog going she dismissed on friday night they're going to be the underdog if they beat the smack going against ... meal most likely CBC I mean they are going to be the underdog the whole rest of the way through the playoffs and it's the Smith likes that those kids like that\nThe play offs and that's the it's the Smith likes that those kids like that and they know they got to come out and they've got a battle night after night out and that's why I you know you talked about a coach sting\nGets it gets those kids playing Steve Smith has just done an absolute phenomenal job at his alma mater up at ...\nYou mentioned pat and we'll over market at the other the top of that bracket or is this is Matt and written or\nJust met no issues no problems and that sets up once again we'll talk about it later but just a terrific game at the smack you know between the Spartans and the pirates on friday night that is just going to be a lot of fun\nFurther down the bracket we got across state match up as eureka took on Ozark from a lot as a you talk about Springfield being southwest you go even further south from Springfield just to get the Ozarks\nYellow Zarqa to make the trek up here and they take it on the ... the number one seed a Kirk wins over Lafayette kind of knew that was going to happen\nAgain that everybody thought was going to be your district final is now your district semi final between Uri can Kirk would Joplin takes care of cook who pool and the huge fashion Lindbergh when so guess where delivered fires get there a\nPitcher travelling shoes on gentleman you are heading for hours down forty four to take on Joplin on and I'm surprised that this is going to be a friday night game\nUm I really thought they may try to push that over to a Saturday but they're going to go friday night and you know that's that's the one thing we talked about when the brackets came out with the districts were laid out that we could see\nSurprises once again your top four seeds all when it sets up some terrific match ups including the backyard robbery down in the southwest corner of the state between weapons DJ\nAnd upset right there I Know the talking has already started I was talking to Korea rigs earlier today are buddy from down in Springfield and be happening is already command Cindy going those two teams so that that bracket it's very interesting starting this week\nUh moved to the right side of the bracket Hayes Ortiz Jennings M. I. C. D. S. parkway north no problems there know\nThat you know Clinton is the only seat that gets that gets dumped and they were the force feed you know four or five seed their Jennings with a nice victory I have with these playing terrific football and I see the U.S and parkway north Saturday afternoon one o'clock over that might CBS\nCould it be Bob buttons last game on the sidelines for parkway north my gosh you know this this is just a game that you know I might see the U.S has been playing a terrific football parkway north as has been playing outstanding football the last part of the season\n... hated you have for this game to be the way it is in the play offs but that's the way it shakes out and it's going to be a lot of fun I I live and they go on a limb to tell you who could win that ball game because I honestly don't know I think it's that much up for grabs right now and that two to three match up\nMoving down the bracket and class for zooming east over warranted forty two fourteen primary and sit down and this was a good game prior writings on thirty seven twenty Hannibal blank St Charles fifty six nothing Westminster parkway central thirty five to Seventeen it's a you know hard to believe in a team like park like central all the success and three or four years ago there on the first round\nYeah you know this was a Greek growing this was a retooling here for for ... and the and the crew over parkway central uh Westminster just impose their will on the ground\nAnd just really random ... extremely well Hannibal no surprise there this is going to be a fun match up on friday night up in Hannibal a priority and nice victory they bounce back after losing the same times last week so nice victory for them and you know ...\n... they're doing what they do\nA but this is going to be a lot of fun between them and primary Jake parrot over prior is just done it absolutely terrific job with that program I mean we talked about the Jefferson County schools not given a whole lot of love to over you know the bunch of years my\nGosh what if we talk about primary being a number three number four seed finishing up here seven and two and then winning a first round game great project parent and those guys\nDistricts added a lot of exciting games will though you were really not familiar with ... many of the schools tops the Orangeburg roles but then about green valley in Grand view that's a three point ... van horn or re town south and I was a five point gain and Harrison ville a over Lincoln that was a six point game\nYeah inherent Seville the succeeding that district and you know ... a big victory you know that was one of the few you know upsets throughout the you know throughout the state so nice when for Harrison ville\nAwards burger has been playing a terrific football year long and they've been kind of on the outside looking in on the pull all year every now and then maybe sticking their toe ended it or not able to get it completely through but\n... you know that district is interesting but it's the bottom part of this bracket that really really interest everybody across the state\nBottom right Platt county or excel sphere spring Smith bill and Carney ... district of I've ever seen one\nIs the seeds hang there's your for their there's four of the top All right\nIn one of the seats hang there's your for there's there's four of the top all rains All right All right um my gosh unbelievable stuff there\nAnd that's where I'm going to be kind of dividing my attention to on friday night is this district and the local stuff because this district is going to go a long way to see who is going to come out on that side in the states in the state playoff four\nTeams enter and a woman will leave and get into the state\nQuarter finals Jay be hitting class three lot of teams that we may not really a lot of folks around here be familiar with so cardinal Ritter that was a fourth fifth\nDay advance Miller career advances Sinclair advances Lutheran south all the ... and their district\nAnd um you know the only surprise their burrows was the force feed Miller career the five seed Goodwin for a Miller Kirk ... bottom part of that stays pretty solid with the two three teams matching up and they say Claire Lutheran south gay and we see the scores their St Clair beats the V. sixty nine to twelve\nLutheran South Beach Baylor sixty six to eight I'll tell you right out set the over under on that game but about eighty five because you've got to terrific quarterbacks you got great skill guys out on the edges\nAnd like their defenses but I just don't think we're going to see a lot of defense in this match up so yeah I mean this district it went right where I expected it to be\n... or looking around the rest in class three are back in the top right generosity\nBeat some near eighty eight to nothing on the core south orange and farm twenty Seventeen St Charles was fifty eight Normandy Eighteen and Lutheran St Charles fifty four sold in six\nTrinity with a big when I say Williams announced before the game he was going to Texas a senior night there no surprise\nUm of course south Berkeley in four or five match up over or tricked farm a kind of surprised a ... a few people uh saint Charles west of stresses just done a terrific job and that's a nice when for them over Normandy\nAnd then Lutheran St Charles are oversold and so not a lot not a big big surprises there\nThis week though a couple of good match ups but once again I still I still maintain its trinity's world right now on that corner before everybody else\nSo as we look at class to for a second a couple of scores and this would be from and class too and district\nTo lift for life beat Cuba Ninety\nSix I seriously at what point do you use does decide again saw it on friday of campus\nWas candidates towards forty two needs Pacific and called off the dog's a halfway through the second quarter at what point\nDo you see we were just not going to do this anymore let's not score Ninety\nI ... I hate to say if this was one of those situations where number one live for life doesn't have a lot of kids\nSo you're kind of stuck with who he got out there but they scored and I do I know but but but I'm not defending them both basically sometimes you know you got you're playing a team that just can't stop anything and unfortunately we're just couldn't stop anything\nAnd yeah I hate it when I saw that's where I hate to see that I I did that really you know but then I look at north Stuart eighty three well Luther ... that's a different scenario Lutheran north to co opt the dogs in any time\nAnd place some of those younger kids but once again you're playing the younger kids against the grand view outta Hillsborough team that's not very good I mean eight you know what you're going to say and I totally understand I totally get it\nIn ... and here's the thing it's sort of the unintended consequences of having everybody make the playoffs yeah this is sort of what you get in the first week it's it's one of the blood letting happens and and now you're not you guys allies\nWe we started to have some better ... and it's just the way it is\nI'll go to the NCAA tournament when you see the same thing and you know most of the time except for when somebody please Virginia in Virginia is the number one seed um you know but most of the time those what those once\nIn a lot of times those games are competitive for like ten or Fifteen minutes you lose Ninety to nothing there's no there's nothing to head into the games over when he pulled the Boston but then I've seen that twice this year down to ... and and it stinks scenarios is still a heck of a lot better than what we had four year it was\nIt's it's the unintended consequences it's part of the deal oh you're right at it they don't want everybody makes it and you're going to have a football program that can't stack up again it and if you're that team that went over nine you're going to face the number one at the end you're going to get wrong\nThat exactly no I totally agree with you but I Will take this system of aids first round games than what we had in the past you one hundred percent without a doubt\nAnd as you said we get some Dante's coming old already on friday we'll talk more about that later in the show we can go to a good word guess line next to Mike\n... from ... do we talk to him earlier this season and a great year that they have had a\nI informed him that I gave them the number would vote to the top ten pole and he proceeded to thank me and say why in the world would you do that so because they beat Kirk would they be Kirkland patent ... where did you catch up with my car because they get ready for their game this coming week and\nWhat a terrific season for they'll do Ramsey and we want to get him on this week to chat about it\nWe'll do that next is the prep sports aboard power by the high school sports care of and the big five fifty Katie RS\nJennifer I'm here to tell you about a new

it\nWouldn't matter how many kids another came as a you know you can only put eleven on the field but we really are getting really buy into that kind of fight of that and uh\nLike I say to their credit the thing that we've done well I think and and all those games are\nA lot of games this year is Americans have been outstanding but we started fast um and so when you can start fast a I think your kids can play with more confidence and you don't have that out and the nice thing that occurred what game a cargo came back in the third quarter started getting the momentum and and and then our kids stepped up the rights of place so\nYeah I mean I Can't be you know more proud of a group um and then we are this year\nI was at the Kirk would gain tarp and believe me when I tell you I sat in the press box and\nYou know it's the first time I've seen you guys live all year long and I knew what your defense was all about the my gosh you guys just you know you put your foot you hit you set it you're going fast you put your foot on the gas pedal and didn't take it off\nAnd you didn't take off in the second half either it's just you know what has those couple of guys out on the edge of the new we're going to finally get a few plays here near but my dodge defensively you guys are just so quick on the edges and especially a problem with Moses\nYeah with oh and then uh you know on the line across the lake and grants with our other deep I've made the senior outstanding player very disciplined choir or mark where America junior tackles on the side of the day and\nAnd uh Brian Faulkner hum I have done you know a rod is is is our last year if I got to say we're uh we're we're blessed to be right\nThere are um I think are\nThose guys have done it out of the ending job obviously most of the presence but I think that we've created a lot of turnover as we fly around um and then he got Andrew out on the back end of it and Jason ... there's\nA lot of lot of our our football players play with great angle of and and play with him after the that are that exciting to watch and are recorded a reprise his though for\nA lot of years and I played I Would do and up later northern Illinois has to have a passion for the game and a huge passion for what they wouldn't have a great job with those guys\nAre those last two games with pat and middle and Kirk wedding and\nWhen I look at the schedule I I knew the background behind it if you knew what side you're on and some of the teams that you're going to have to seize to get back to the state championship game\nThose two games within themselves probably were more productive for you then maybe some of the games early in the season to get ready for the next five weeks to get you to back to Columbia\nYeah I Would I Would say so and then when we put though when I got it okay and my uh an hour for a day we were we were making the schedule and and then he sat down and looked at it on paper it was like oh you know wow I'm\nFor a team and and um\nBut I think the nice thing is if you can play the game and you know obviously you want to win the games but um and and these are say that after the fact but even if you can this compete in those games it allows her kids to go into games again from the town the teams that are in the for a bracket and\nThey're not they're not shocked by what they're going to see a you know I don't think uh I mean I I think like I said to my website is as good as there is a mistake I think most people would say that you're in you're out and what they do as extreme of what they do they do extremely well\nBut uh haven't played the pound that vocal put on the field and Kirk work and put it on the field and had no I'm like I said it's coming out and bought those games in playing well especially early on was a great for our kids and hopefully will serve as well going forward\nNo doubt about it ... I Know it's a busy time you get ready for friday night against St Mary's thank you for taking some time out to visit with us and I know me and it will be shot and the rest of the way hopefully a lot of victory summing up for a little do\nBut I appreciate you got that right I think science coach bank\nLike ... to head coach at la du land gosh the job that he's done over there now and here's the other thing to guys\nThe job that she has done not playing a home game years just ride last weekend the plan must field at Webster Groves this week they go back to their home away from home Kirk what I mean come on you you got you\nGot a number one give those kids all the credit in the world not having a stadium the plan and believe me when when they get that stadium done for next year\nIt's going to be one of the best day the only thing that's been a steak is there is no lights come on we'll do come on China country splits loosen up and let these kids playing football on Friday nights you know but you know Saturday afternoons outlive do are going to be ... in that brand new facility it's ...

look at it in two ways been for a for Barry in in this team or a loss like that as again utterly painful as it is it's\nIt's clear to me the team is better than it was last year and the gains that the one I think we all understand the circumstances those games worrying and teams that were complete dumpster fires you played\nStand the circumstances those games worrying and teams that were complete dumpster fires you played Idaho and Yukon down the stretch as well I think the team is better\nSo there's I look at in the sense that he's brought in good players the recruiting his slowly gotten better the inroads into St Louis they've improved [noise] so I think you can point to progress that isn't just wins and losses on the flip side\nI understand people that point too\nYou know here's X number of games so far this year and this team is unable to get over the hump whether it's a good team whether it's a bad team and you can directly point to coach gene decisions you and say hey they've got the players their talent and yet they're not winning air go\nYou should go in another direction I understand both sides of it but I think what what is helping Barry right now\nIs the fact that there is noticeable improvement the problem has been it it's a results oriented business it's wins and losses there really\nAre the it's tough to point to anything else as an indicator in sports especially football when there's so few opportunities to go out there and play you've got what eleven means to go out you get loving guaranteed games every year it there's a or whatever it is living twelve Thirteen who knows in college football these days but\nYou only have so many games in if if wins and losses are the only way to measure it and then I I I get what people say on that side of the equation\nGot eleven real games when the ... that's a excluding the F yes they are everybody right here I think that too though it really where Barry stands right now is\nIs literally you can't expect the arguments on both sides and both sides have a good point because he's literally a coach's fighting for his job I mean that's that's what is going on right now I'm he can point to the inroads made in St Louis he can appoint to the recruiting ... getting better you can point to a close some of these losses have been um ... and that's all valid\nHis critics can point to\nTo not having a for sure answer quarterback next season as critics can point to or you know some of the some of the really confusing play calling that continues it became a story again on on Saturday\nUm and he can point to you know there's there's things on both sides so that to me is why anyone who's saying that Barry Odom stayed has decided right now I I think it's just guessing to be honest because we know a jumpstart operates\nUm he wants to make his decision after the season's over he said as much at this point last year when we were having these very similar discussions question and it turned out to be the spot where he felt good about the way the season ended that could still be the case this year\nNow the tigers have backed themselves into a corner there's not much wiggle room I'm certainly a win against Florida and up to the photo would have a better feel to it I don't see how that happens at this point um and it is no matter what happens this year I think will go down as as a a disappointing you're from a zoo\nTo some degree because I think this was the year that you felt like they had the talent that was on its way out the ... capitalize especially on the offensive side of things and really that has been\nUm one of the more head scratching things about this team is that it it's supposed it's strength was supposed to be it's quarterback Andrew Luck has has struggled and he played he struggled as the season has progressed he's he has gotten\nDon't think he's gotten worse but he but he hasn't been the kind of he hasn't proven he can rise up and play his best against some of these some of these good teams he gets worse when the defenses get better and that hasn't changed so I I think I think and I'm not putting it on a lock but that can be the big question if you're trying to analyze this team is why isn't the strength to strength right now\nIn terms of the passing it they've been able to run the ball a lot better they came in the season wanting to do it and they've been able to to find traction there but their best player on the field the reason they threw him that third and two on Saturday which was a play that we can debate I'm sure we will just because they want to keep the ball in their best players hands and he hasn't been playing like their best player\nMore in Missoula later or let's continue here on the sports ticker\nFive fifty tiara [noise]\nNews from the cardinal today that Marcello soda I had a little garden is about two or did he have a little cleanup procedure on the shoulder\nUh Craig Mish down there in Miami reporting that news earlier this afternoon and it looks like he'll be all systems go come spring training I guess it was really a matter of uh of when not if I was doing was going to have this procedure band and now\nYou can look to next year we've talked about it a little bit over ... is going to be primed for a bounce back season\nIn two thousand and Nineteen ah I think we both wonder [noise] uh what what that ultimately will lead to buddy it's a it's ... it's ... it'll be time for a put up or shut up here he's going to have a he's going to have a year where he can get paid and\nIf ah if he's healthy like he was two years ago in Miami we know that type of numbers you can put up\nThe whole issue surrounding his shoulder it's been so mysterious from the beginning um initially it was the cardinals knew about it but they weren't too concerned about it then it kind of gravitated into it's affecting him but he he won't get treated and then after the season at the cardinals basically came out\nAnd said that look we we were not real thrilled with the way it was handled um we can that was kind of the ... the infamous John was quote about leading someone to water but not making them drink\nI'm ... and it was became pretty clear that they were taking a priority and getting sick this off season at the time\nThe season ended the cardinals were pretty confident that it was only going to be arrested in physical therapy issue so it sounds like this procedure first of all on backtrack a little bit the procedures been that the checkup in Los Angeles has been\nPlanned for a long time right he was going to go after the season ended um his doctorate Dodgers team doctor Dodgers are still playing okay checkup that he's out there to do that whether or not there was going to be a procedure kind of depends on how the procedures described\nLike I think that some people will say well it's not a big massive surgery it's more of a clean up some people say is there is no such thing as a minor surgery but it does sound like there's going to be some sort of some sort of\nOperation of some sort maybe not as intensive as we usually think when we ah\nWell they say ... rates clean up right in in ... flight to listeners can't hear any way the hope is that he's ready to go full go for spring training in this well of course you know have him back to his normal self a big part of that is how you recuperate and also how he trains leading into spring training\nAnd that's something the cardinals have been adamant about for all their players this all seen as they want to see proof of progress they want to see that these guys are investing in themselves so they don't show up to spring training ... me and my arm feels funny they show up to spring training ready to roll\nFor it was you know it's a it's certainly hopefully some help on the defensive side of the equation there as well because you were at times of liability in left field that that that hopefully these rectified\nYeah and there were just moved there were times when he looked like the guy who won the gold last year then there are times are looked like he was playing with the you know up a fake arm\nWas stapled to his uniform so hopefully this you know this takes care of that um I I Do I Do wonder you know ... there's been talk your I get questions about as well of course of the cardinals tried to trade him I said look\nYou went through what you hope is the worst Marcel as we talked about a ... weeks ago this is every reason he's got millions and millions of reasons to go out and have a monster year next year you want to see what he does and you want to see what he does in your uniform you ...\nReasons to go and have a monster year next year you want to see what he does and you want to see what he does and your uniform you whether what you hope is the bad and ah he knows what he's playing for he knows what's on the line I think you know I think he I think you have a better chance of seeing a a bonkers you refer marshals you know if he's healthy and that's the biggest\nSpent ... before we take her first breaking Allen's been waiting patiently on the line here nine six nine key to your us if you'd like to join in Alan welcome to the big five fifty\nWell how are you\nOn the last year [noise]\nI find it funny that everybody thought a lot of people thought\nThe strength of the Missouri team was going to be the quarterback and they were talking about I don't know\nWhy wasn't really no better last year when it came out against the FCC is what you gotta consider to be [noise]\nYou know the competition lower than they are going over there quite a number of understand where all this\nStuff came from coming into this year it was it like you let it\nAgain last year\nAnd he did all added up
