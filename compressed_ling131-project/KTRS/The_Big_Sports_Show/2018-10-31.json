later to take a look at the top twenty five but the college football playoff rankings maybe talks and called the troops are along the way because we from tonight it's underway it'll be games going on\nThe big ones between\nA Duke in Kentucky Kansas and Michigan State my own mind it's gonna be awesome um\nBut right now I also say that with a cab you out with us\nHere in Studio in work the same way with a with me and ram or at times will say we're going to talk about this this this and this\nHalf the stuff ends up on the cutting room floor by the time they're not as over so that you know don't hate us if we haven't touched on everything by the time the night is over we got two hours I think we've got a lot of time but you just never know [noise]\nUm so anyway feel free to jump in at any point during the show tonight bent let's start with some baseball season's over I tonight would've been\nGame six between the red Sox and the Dodgers it's it is always kind of sad to reach the end of the baseball season you know for me\nThere's two sports so I can watch every single night at the wrong it's baseball or college basketball and there's just that little margin in between where you've got like a couple of weeks we're all in this case all we can between baseball and hoops and then college basketball and by the time cause you to over we're back to baseball so it's a\nIt's a great thing to to look at it that way but I I Am sad that the season's over\nDo you do in this week little weak window I don't actually look at a book that you just read this you probably just like ... study college basketball box wired previews I Am still reading uh the the blue ribbon basketball preview right now so yeah so I've I've got that for another week\nBefore the games action is a Bible for college bow I Love it but it Chris door to the publisher of it and uh\nThe Bible for college by I Love it my buddy Chris ... is the publisher of it and uh I mean it's really incredible how many houses I mean the coaches get that phone call and it's and they're like honor to be called by the blue ribbon college basketball if it was really good job but\nWhen you think of how many teams are are in division one and they've got I mean these are like ... hours in where he lived a little blurb no Chris George huge cardinals fan by the way don't kidding yeah small world right absolutely I mean who isn't cardinal fan ... ah especially that court ordered St Louis\nDown south to go Arkansas Kentucky Tennessee that's had a strong\nCardinals country down there there's no question about it bought season over band and now we're officially in the free agency and cardinals fans can start to go crazy they're wish to lose art\nOkay continue to go crazy thinking we'd been there a is a seemingly since the since the season ended but now teams could officially go out there and start to start to shop for their for ages I Want to start\nHere though band and a lot of came out with the odds are as to where ultimately some of these free agents are going to end up Bryce Harper remaining Machado the too big guns the cardinals were nowhere to be found on any of those odds\nPearl Harbor arm that shot which is obviously disappointing uh on prices in any way but let's let's move over to Josh Donaldson for a moment because Donald Sudan is currently\nA or a cardinals I should say are the current favorite to land Josh Donaldson obscure odds like six to five or something like that overwhelming odds which which surprised me\nThat Donald soon we'll wind up in St Louis and again a lot of times these guys in Vegas they\nThey know something so I'll I'll give them I'll give them some credit there I I for one been there would have been a time if two years ago the prospects of Josh Donaldson landing in St Louis would be exciting but I've got to be honest with you Ben this move to me\nDoes it move the needle and I think the cardinals if if indeed they are in bed with Donaldson here I think it'd be in a pretty extraordinary risk\nWell a few things here and it's it's it's ... odd so we're not saying that this is this is not ... sure up especially when we do here but but\nBecause one of the guys you know the the diamond backs can't resigned everybody on the roster\nUm they already they they're going to bring back old spent they announced that he picked up that option which of course it was only fourteen million they get so I guess trade them but they also brought back they extended\nEscobar right and that was a guy that we're all kind of pointing to that he can make some sense we are getting third baseman played ... innings there this season hit for pop left handed he could he could hit lefty just switch but now he's going to be there I don't think they probably resign I don't think they extended to trade him but so they are they going to Jake land\nThat could have guessed move escorted different position and and have land play third but that's a name that it's off the radar a little bit but you start to wonder okay what are some ... some below the radar moves that the cardinals\nCould potentially look at 'em or what might make sense for the cardinals and I think those names are are are neat to serve the fans won't won't like talking about those but my God we can only talk about price heartburn manual channel so\nMuch here's what you mentioned Jake Lamb and I think that's a great off the radar name because one you ... place third base to either left handed hitter three he's still young I think he's twenty seven yeah any crushes writing and his value right now is\nHer allegedly or didn't play it has shoulder injury so that's another I mean that's an injury concern so we'll we'll be fair and point out injury concerns as such but he was younger and has had pretty good seasons especially against rise and I can't\nLet these very well um and and that's why I don't know if you want to get a trade for a guy who's more of a ... to ... looks like more of a platoon split guy but another name that you know Arizona's going to have to do something because they got there for a while I was talking about they're going to sell off so you think they're going to have to get rid of some players eventually I Wonder if that's one name that could be on the market\nAnd I know he's price goes up incrementally this year judge or go\nBought\nJerk all when he's right crushes left ... I Know that's a pretty expensive platoon guy it's third base but if you had a situation\nWhere you've got your left handed third baseman in your writing and third baseman Jay claim ... combo I could live with that\nWill ... is also good defensively a third no doubt some people think I'm Down on jet because I targeted third base the place the cardinals could improve I'm not down on jet at all I Do think this was the year for him to kind of try to prove that he was more than what he is and unfortunately because his body has a hard time staying healthy when he plays that much he wasn't able to do it\nBut when he's healthy eat he plays very well pleased with sound defensive being better than that he plays good defense a third base and as you said he's got great great success against against the or the ...\nAnd he's got great great success against against the or the ... so\nYou know what can you is there a way to keep him and help that approach the ... kind of hinted at doing it last season that's why I bring it up as maybe you know maybe it's something they would still be opening to\nIt and get a better you know edition than than than than Adams I'm just something to think about if they're not they're not going for that bold headlined move or if they don't get it I mean that could very well go after Bryce not get them to do something they can't they don't get Bryce Harper they can't just say oh shucks we got to fold the team like they're going to\nTry to make one\nHere's the thing if you get Bryce Harper you're going to need other moves and you're going to need some under the radar Mussa ... move\nSort of accomplishes that and I think he's heading into arbitration but you're still not at a point with him where he's going to cost you an arm and a leg and he could in fact be a young stopgap in between where you're at right now in Gorman two years\nTo let me ask you this okay so if if that's if you like that move would you rather trade valuable prospects for Jake Lamb who's maybe a platoon or would you rather take of take a risk on\nUnjust Johnson [noise] I I Would rather than having to take the risk on Donald so I think I'd go towards lamb and I I'm not sure how many\nI'm not sure how many prospects it it it's not going to be that you have to move something but\nI see that as a a slightly more attractive option simply because I think\nNumber one or train for a guy that is what four or five years younger than Donaldson is I understand I mean we're basically talking about the cost here is prospects versus money\nSo what ultimately do you value more obviously the cardinals gonna value their prospects more what they say and Bryce Harper [laughter] somebody there'll be hurting him the money to find [laughter]\nUh I I I think\nThere's a little more\nI Want to say long term upside with land\nI mean obviously you could you could you know spend\nThe wheel in and hit a homerun with with Donald Senate if he's right\nBut I I Will like the prospects of of what a lamp can do and I want to\nI I looked up obviously his splits from last year they're useless because you hardly played but his split some twenty Seventeen he was almost ... because you think about that ballpark down there especially two years ago before the they brought the humor ... humid or down at a\n... splits Holleman road almost identical in eight thirty nine O P s at home and actually eight fifty ... away\nFrom their home ballpark he's splits get right against right hander used that had been nine thirty eight O P s against right handed pitching with twenty five home runs\nThat is an answer to a ball club that needs that type of production I again I think he adds some uh some diversity to all lined up that you could\nLefty righty a little more balanced and if if you're not getting rid of jerk go you've got a lot of options there at third base\nYeah I mean I just a name to like it makes you think I mean you look through a lot of these new animal I don't see it I don't see it he's the one that if something went okay I can maybe see that\nYeah me too I I I think that's a I think that'd be a very ... going to have\nThat same thing about Marlon Gonzales looks up Marlon Gonzalez isn't he's got he's at the anti splits that you want\nHe's better against the uh he's better against the left he's you know as somebody said well could they platoon Marwan Gonzalez ... uh well that if you want to have better you ideally you want the guy from ... to have better opposite splits and he doesn't um but ... is fascinating and I think it'll be really interesting to watch\nFree agent see because you've so versatile yep he plays a million different positions and uh that's that seems to be something teams value more often there is a really good article and then they'll be calm about he made him may being maybe being like a sleeper\nAsleep or player that that teams get really competitive for because of his versatility um but unfortunately I don't know that he makes a ton of sense for the cardinals because\nOne of their ... one of their priorities need to get needing to get better you can get better against the right he's\nYeah yeah exactly right I'm not sure you need versus ... you've got a lot of versatility defensively it's not necessarily\nGood gold glove versatility by either tomorrow and he's just he can play that a lot you can play a lot of different spots and on it to me get me a guy that is left the hits right handed pitching to bring it back around\nBand to Josh Donald ... I I Do I could see him as somebody that he certainly going to be somebody that would follow you would think harbor and ... those are the guys that have to set the market right\nAt least that's the way we we will if you ballistic it's got all Eris\nPrice already knows where he I Know I'm I'm guessing you guys talked about that but yeah you know Boris ... can enjoy this and you know in his there is a there is an argument that he might try to delay this and ... and and whenever he feels like it's going to be best for his client\nI Can't imagine a Bryce was already made up his mind of what he wants to do\nIt has been back channel by some coastal forest that that was just a joke that he's on down there and I and I read the I mean for instance to it it sounds like it's like it's a little teasing nature yeah but he's doing what he does he stirred the pot and a part of me wonder maybe if he's during the ... because he thinks this is going to move quickly\nUm and he kinda got up to it but I wouldn't call the false start but he he ... he fired the shock on on the race a little bit early to to you know kind of jump out there and throw that out there doing a you know while the world series is going on so\nWe're gonna we're gonna find out relatively soon like last year member it was the ... like the tiny freeze where everybody was so ... so hung up on Stanton that autonomy that nobody else made moves is if you're going to be similar to that or is this going to\nOne of those guys going to go out to board soon and in the ball gets rolling I I think if I had to guess I Would guess slower moving because it seems like every team is almost paralysis by analysis at this point\nBut I mean that that that the G ... meeting start in a week a week from today out in California and sometimes deals go down at those usually that's kind of the table Center for the winter meetings but you know this isn't a fascinating\nFascinating year here and also because the biggest available players are not trades trades are more complicated right they're free agents and they're also\nHomegrown free agents you know there are a lot of questions a lot of uncertainty about autonomy people to know that much about um everybody knows about every knows about Harper everybody knows about I'm Manny so there shouldn't there really shouldn't be a need for it to move that slow unless unless the agents are delaying things\nCardinals can way they can hit a homerun making it a home run with Harper and I I there are some folks that are are going to be are going to think back to some of Harper's not so you know not so clean moments as as a ballplayer but\nOne of those types of schools because\nThey had lost since Maryland they have that one last that's been hung in Oklahoma so far Texas goes chokes against Oklahoma State done in Stillwater Texas find themselves ranked number Seventeen they're probably done\nYeah absolutely and the last to Maryland [noise] um my God it looks worse and worse as the season goes along considering all the crazy stuff that's going on a male and that was that's a that's a program in in shambles at the moment I'm you know Texas\nIs still probably a positive you know season so far no doubt no doubt that I Know that they think that you know they should be in it every single year but I mean this was a team that played\nThis was a team that that you know celebrate it like it won the super bowl ever be a ball game last year in a in a ... in the Texas Bowl I mean Tom Herman has gone from from from mocking drew lock with a backpack to to being a fired up and and disappointed he's he's at Seventeen and to see a peace so\nOutside of Texas it's still pretty good in Texas yeah pets heads are falling off but that's no surprise\nUh Iowa State in the big twelve by the way with a just a foreign the record gets into the top twenty five there in twenty four\nWe talked about ... before I again I don't know what may or may not happen at the zoo and Campbell is going to be a a hot property on the a coach free agent market at the end of the year uh heat's not going to be up in ... much longer I don't think\nWell unless they you know pay big and keep paying to keep them um I've been on you know ... Campbell since I worked in Wyoming he cut his speech was the Toledo coach they would play Wyoming and at the time he was the youngest of BS head coach and the country\nAs teams played hard they were well coached they were aggressive I'd just like the style of the of the program he was coaching these hasn't you know he's only he's only climbed since then he's obviously the most attractive candidate\nOut there right now but I don't know that he's feeling like he has to get out of the aims right away\nUm and I don't know that he's certainly wants to leave for the right job um he's almost in Tom Herman Houston category where he can kinda just sit back and pick his pick is right yeah I ... my advice to him not that he needs to be not to rush he can he's going to get to pick his destination it sounds like he's got a pretty good thing rolling\nI tell you the team right now that I really like I I think plane they're not the\nHighest ranked team in the pack twelve using Utah play at all lately a team that we think about his all defense call waiting hand and he's been there for a long time you think defense decent defence with Utah they're running a lot more up tempo on offense right now and that defense is still stacked\nI think if if they were to if they were to win out and there was some chaos up above them they'd be an intriguing option I you know I'm not saying they're going to get to the college football playoff those teams that are more middle of the pack that you don't think has a shot [laughter] I I think they may be playing better than anybody\nI uh I think the college football in Utah in general's we're talking about Utah State is off to a freakish Goodyear buddy buddy Dave Yost youngest burning upsetting office of records up there I mean one of the best off into the country so who knew Utah hotbed for college football this season\nNouveau wouldn't have put money on it that's for sure and its hair still looks great by the way for anyone I tried to do [laughter] I'm moving down to the top fifth senior Penn State's fourteen West Virginia out of the big twelve is Thirteen\nUCF twelve Florida a weapon a quick little notes U. Penn State they get a big win against Michigan on Saturday West Virginia it looks like that collision with Oklahoma coming in is your chance to play a game of the big truck championship game [noise]\nBut then you see a few ban at twelve undefeated but still not making much headway to where it matters that being the top for the top six\nAnd play better put better teams play a tougher schedule you can't play better than undefeated but you can if you see it doesn't get to play it both ways of I think I've said this when we talk about this before either wants to see from UCF\nDocument T I literally I mean teams can do videos that can do promotional stuff now I Want to see documentation of every legitimate team that wouldn't play them non conference\nI Want them to stop talking about how they should be ranked ... I Want you to prove that you've tried to schedule these tougher opponents to improve your your resume so you can be in the top ten or I Want you to stop talking about being overlooked you can't have it both ways you have to go try to have teams play and you can prove it All right then I'll listen to your argument\nBut stop trying to argue that you're winning streak goes back to last season nobody wants to hear that every year the the college football landscape refreshes so stopped talking about Eighteen whatever consecutive wins that got a new coach new team throw that out now you are undefeated you've got some good wins I'll give you that\nBut uh but I don't I convinced that UCF as it was a top ten team in college football right now\nAnd until I until I have proof from them that of all these teams that they tried to play to prove that they are then I don't really I don't really care much about how much that one and I think he'd winning and other teams I don't lose they're gonna keep climbing and that's how it should be but nothing tells me that UCS\nWhich nearly lost to Memphis is one of the best one of the top ten teams in college football at the moment\nCome on band they played the blank South Carolina state and the second week of the season it's\nWhat they're doing and I and I you know why don't knock them for doing it because if if people believe it then it helps them but come on guys if you really want to\nBecause if if people believe it then it helps them but come on guys if you really want to be this team if you want to be up three four then you've got to start playing the big boys or going out of your way to play the big boys to the point that you can turn around and say look world here all the teams that said no to us\nAnd they don't believe you but you're not doing that so I'm not buying it\nWe mentioned earlier that the Missouri Tigers have played three teams in the top nine will talk about them in a second but there's a force now in the top eleven\nWas played Florida on sit on Saturday afternoon the gators don't drop that much after losing to the Georgia Bulldogs and the reason why we disagree on this I give them a zoo at least at least the punches chance on Saturday because\nUh Florida is going to be down after losing their rivalry game against the dogs but still some respect and a ton of respect\nFor the SEC banned because then you go from Florida to looking at for\nSEC teams in the top ten\nCould be you could very well be five in Florida a single five in the top eleven\nYeah and uh I don't have a problem with that I Know some people will um but I mean as someone who watches as much as you said football's anybody in the country um I think I think it's fair to say\nWhere the best teams reside for the most part pound for pound think you can look at the post season the LA is gone and and and and have that fact justified um you know I I think some people are going to get up in arms over it but I got no I got no beef with it um you know they beat up on each other and they tend to go out and beat up on other teams the top of the SEC to\nUh and and really heavy heavy love for the for the SEC Alabama one you know you got LSU three I got LSU might be beneath Notre Dame so LSU hopes up and then Georgia right outside the top five there\nLSU gets three because they've got I think among all the teams have better than what it what Ballmer clumps things done you can make an argument that LSU should be hired and three that got the best when of anybody they'd be Georgia and they didn't just be Georgia they stopped\nGeorgia and then to see what they do in turn to Florida makes that LSU when look even better here's the deal for SEC teams in right now banned but it will work itself out Kentucky has one loss that will change Georgia has won last that could change\nLSU won last Alabama zero so of course they're in there and now\nThey there won't be for I don't think it may be still three\nBut what fascinates me is will we see to FCC teams in the top for when it's all said and done that is the big question and I I think the easiest way to get there\nIs for LSU at least to start is for LSU too when Saturday or\nHave Alabama and Georgia both run the table get to the SEC is championship game and Georgia beat Alabama then I think you'd have an easy argument or to get to SEC teams in at that point\nAre there any in the top twenty five or the teams that I wanted to ask you two questions about this are there any teams like surprise you\nMaybe not I guess asking that in two ways of the teams that surprise you they're ranked are also teams that have surprised you this season and then your mention HUD coaching prospects you know that that that the conversation is going to be happening soon\nLike who's the next guy to get poached are there any coaches that you think that it really help themselves so far this year I think you know I mean I'm looking at Syracuse you know do you know but you know labor's his name is going to continue to be\nHot one on the on the ... the Dina [laughter] and Mike Leach to um you know I don't know if people want to jump in bed with Mike Lee ... a lot

he's certainly rehabbed himself after the way things ended for him at the at Texas Tech\nWe almost have to Tennessee job last year it was practically isn't it all blew up I'm not sure if that would be better off I'll say this they might have been better off this year with Mike Leach\nI don't know I don't know I don't know about that said I all that he wants to run plays in the SEC either I don't

I don't think I don't I've not heard a good reason other than bullets how it's always been that the schools should have to\nPut the kids should have to sit for a season if he goes elsewhere and you know technically Evansville did nothing wrong here that up breaking any rules in fact they're saying you should have to follow the rules there shouldn't be an exception made for you so that's their that's that's their opinion\nLooking like Harris playing immediately it in the state but cares to leave because we coaching change he wasn't happy at the zoo which you could have said bless not a good reason we're going to try to not participate with this waiver to have you immediately eligible and said ms he said you know what\nIt didn't work out and we moved on and we're not going to we're not going to end in effect punish him with a red shirt year\nIf anything you can point to what happened with Jonathan Williams when he left after you know during the commander ... he was recruited by the previous coach commanders want to keep him he didn't want to go can manage to try to put restrictions on him and guess what can I just got hammered for it nationally he was criticized for saying you can't you shouldn't do this to players\nSo I I think that's a better example to point to and it was wrong and I I I get it and I understand the mid majors have to protect it I think this is an example that everyone who argues for the majors protecting their turf is conveniently excluding of why ... why drew Smith wanting to leave you want to leave because it's coach left\nUp to the players who are committed and it sounded that time they get out of the things they're not they're not they don't have to sit out a year or else if they leave why\nShould a player who came there ... we all agree right the players commit to coaches and not the team's fair and I think we're all on the same page there anyone who argues differently probably doesn't have a good feel for how this stuff works I just don't and I and I don't I don't get why if the waivers there at the agency that leaves granting um what what I don't understand what Evansville gains from saying\nWe're not going to cooperate with this waiver request because I\nDon't get the because because of what because you're upset he less because it's going to be ... ... they're going to keep someone else from leaving like I don't understand the rationale other than that it makes you feel better that drew Smith doesn't get to play it must be the season\nAnd it being part of it is it's the rules and I ... and and and you mentioned the zoo and that's great but you\nKnow it's a robot but but the waiver is a rule the waivers up a ... the waiver is a\nIs an official quest to get an exception from the rules so technically that is a rule so to say it's just the rules but no I mean there there are the NC double a grant grants or or declines the waiver so it's not like this is just being around some backdoor deal\nNo you're right it but ... and I think there's I think there's a difference from your coach left to go take a better job or left to go be in the NBA or left because he's under federal investigation there's a difference between that and your coach got fired you know Marty Simmons was there for what eleven or twelve years and it just wasn't working\nAnd I I it's not a huge difference but I think there's enough of a difference there where your coach was fired was because you know\nIt's not like he got two years already seen as was there for a long time and it just didn't work out when your coach just ups and leaves\nFor a better job I'm with you on that front I don't care where it happens many major so far off our fired by the Celtics then you'll be okay with it and that's probably because Evansville one thirty game but they didn't wasn't very good and that's why he was fired\nIt's again it's it's a small difference but I think it's enough\nTo where if a if a player wants to leave because he's coach abandoned him I'm On board with that but if he was fired am\nI I I get it and I'm not completely against it by understand\nEspecially if you're in the mid majors why Europe program would be hesitant to sign off and make this a or continue to make it a precedent there by ... it's certainly a ... right now a big part of college basketball is it's happening left and right and you mentioned ... Blake\nNow a big part of college basketball is it's happening left and right and you mentioned at the zoo let Blake Harris go and see state\nWill good on ... there's not an epidemic of players leaving FCC schools to go to the colonial\nThat's you know that's not happening so much to shoot to let a transfer like that go I just think it's different in the mid major land where the brain by some of these conferences kitten and got it bad guys that are that wouldn't be juniors and seniors\nThat would be the you know the top two or three scores on a team you get a look down on the southern\nConference or look in the big south or the south\nLand I mean these little tiny conferences and they they might have some good players and if they have a good year a good sophomore season now they they can transfer in play right away a couple of things not on board\nThey're always talking about the mid majors getting gutted for their best players by bigger programs but we never talk about the guys who mid majors are adding his transfers you know we talk we talk about a one way always we never talk about the guy saying\nOh usually the guys that go to the guys that are average gene point nine points a game or playing five minutes a game and they go to the mid majors to get a bigger shot more opportunity because they weren't plane on their power five so what kind they're still out there still city now is that\nBig of it is that big of a difference between the guys who are leaving the mid majors to go play at a power five program versus the guys who are leaving a power five program to go play it up\nYeah he's not a guarantee the guys are going to play a mid majors EPA sit out a year\nNot always look at some of the guys have become immediately eligible that season I mean there is a is an ... and ... and I don't I guess I just I'm always to me I'm not going to describe it as such a negative thing people have been having an hauling up transfers killing college basketball ever since I've been transfers every time I\nTurn on college vessel seem to be doing okay I'm not feeling the game and we and we talk a lot about the players and look you know the tea the programs for X Y and Z into them and and oh my God how can they leave\nWe never ever talk about we need and you've never seen a coach leave for a better job yet Melvin major coaches leave to go take power five jobs because they prove themselves at that level and then they go get paid millions so why is it why is it just normal procedure when a coach does it\nAnd why is it sold so taboo in killing the sport when a player does\nSound that channel is I just don't want to set a precedent towards guys don't feel like there's a decision in ramifications every decision you make in your life they're gonna be some ramifications but if you give a kid just a complete free pass to leave school and you don't have to sit out a year I I\nI I think that needs to be part of the process I think\nThat's the wild west of argument right that everybody can transfer wherever they want and play immediately and I and I were not there yet and I see I see the drawbacks of that to me ... losing your coach is a is an area of the NC double a needs to look at and say okay\nWhat do we owe the players in this situation what's fair to the player in the situation again the player doesn't get to say whether the coaches fired the player doesn't get the same whether what coach tired\nBut he doesn't get the same with the ... for a better job I think players in that spot should get an that's an I think that is an area that the agency that leads to look and say we need to look at how this has done\nAnd one one of the ways that you can make that better for players is to say if your coat sleeves and your program with a fresh start and you have an opportunity for a fresh start as well that's not the rule right now so Evans will not clear not breaking any rules\nBut it does seem like the incidentally is moving toward letting guys in that situation\nIt seems like the incivility is leaning toward letting guys play but if you're old school doesn't want you to then it's going to it's going to have a say until something changes to me\nI just don't know what that does to help the ... the previous school and and I get it and I'm familiar with the with the plight of of of the smaller the smaller programs and I and I understand it but but I think at the end of the day you need to do what's best for the player this is about student athletes more than it's about\nConferences and programs is about these guys and I'm not saying that drew Smith is his wife has ruined if he has to stay at Evansville I'm not I'm not being dramatic but to me college basketball in college football\nThey get a lot of benefit from these guys these these student athletes\nAnd and more times than not it's often time that you know the student athlete is the one who gets to sort of the stick and I think that's what I'm always get when it's what I'm always going to be on the lookout for and I've yet to hear convincing argument other than\nSome you know plant your flag and shake your fist in the air that that Evansville get any benefit out of out of out of stopping to Smith from playing them as the season\nBut here's the thing he doesn't have to stay at him and he's still able to transfer he's still able to have is two years of eligibility he gets an extra year on scholarship bride I mean it's not like it's not like in in the third year Missouri is going to say well you know what it's five years we don't have to we don't have to pay for it he's going to have all of that\nYou say is getting the short end of the stick I think that's a little bit extreme though maybe Missoula getting the short end of the stick because they don't get him why he went out and he wants to sit out he wants to play a kick out of my years on the play but\nIt gets to go hang out with his friends and and uh and get to watch I mean it's it's not the worst thing in the world and there were\nGood argument ... being the worst thing the world's not a good argument well let's let's put it like this we're not that far removed from schools completely blocking it came from transferring at all no that won't happen be kill exactly it won't happen\nBecause public perception as it should be is starting to stick up for this play out\nAnd and I think that's good I think you know I'm not I think when we're talking about who which side to lean on this I think we should lean toward the guys who are not getting paid to make millions of dollars for college sports\nAnd if that upsets athletic directors and coaches who make ... make a lot of money then uh then I think that's the right side I think we're I think it's the right side of history to beyond when you're saying hey\nMore freedom more more\nOpportunity for these student athletes who are not getting a very big chunk of this by we call you know this money making giant that is college athletics\nHow did you find\nOut is nothing like the realm of your favorite entree cooking outside underground frankly are from showers hardware here to tell you we have a

could help basketball the make other guys better dispose of\nPlayers who've ever played with\nSo could he make a transition yes we ...\nWe we do but we also have to have you played within the office and make other guys better um [noise]\nWe were very pleased with his valid of his games or how he passed it made a lot of hockey if she has made a lot of the greatest is made from top shot fix them open shot and then it was very good defensively which we were kind of wondering uh [noise]\nBut uh but yeah I was pleased with is the way he play that's\nTravis for earlier today at Shea Fitch a RINO as the bill it can get set for their final exhibition game on Thursday and coach T Ford referencing the speaking of transfers the transfer from ...\nAh from Drexel by way of zoo\nTo remain Isabel who I think we're we're starting to get a sense band and what the rules could look like for this bill that can team and I I haven't seen from the beginning\nThat I could see Isabel more ads that lead guard your guy and that is looking to score\nWere Jordan Goodwin is more of your do everything point guard to distribute to rebound to defend were Goodwin may score in the neighborhood of twelve to Thirteen a game I looked for Isabelle maybe closer than that Seventeen\nRange may be leading the teen view was dynamite over the weekend\nAnd he looks healthy and I think obviously that's key\nBut I you know I I don't think what we saw it is a bill at Drexel last year is ... again a lot of that was high volume stop a disguise legit score and let's be honest actual which saloon needs they need guides to put the ball in the basket\nThey didn't have that last year in fact they haven't had it in a while good when I think could get to that point but they need that war that can create\nOn the perimeter and then I think is the bill's their guy\nI loved everything about the way that he played in an exhibition and\nI watched it and I was intently focused on him and and how he fit in he so new they got the the number on the back of his uniform is still kind of like they have and I heard it on you like it it looks different than all of his teammates but Travis just talked about\nA lot of players can go out and find their shot that isn't a good skill to have but it's not unique they need to remain to be a guy who conducts they need him to be a facilitator and also a score they need him to serve two masters he has to be the straw that starts to drink\nAnd then you also have to have scoring yes needs to lead this team and scoring at times but first he wants them to look to try to make his teammates better that's what he's here to do to prove that he can be a point guard\nAnd I thought the way that he played in this exhibition was really really encouraging now again it's Quincy last uh Maryville twice last year I don't think he's going to you know ... up you got to consider the opponent but still you saw\nYou saw tremendous bell look to help\nGet his teammates involved first he was a B went past first he he made it a few beautiful passes he was he was head up looking to looking to involve his teammates at one point in time it allowed Jordan good one to go down and play in the post on a mismatch with the smaller guard\nHaving your main dominate the ball allows Jordan to do a lot better things and we saw him do last year because he's so firstly so strong\nAnd bringing the ball to court it really can find some to that role I like Jordan more of a as a mismatch guy and he's gonna he's gonna bring the ball up some but having to remain be that guy really allows Goodwin to to maximize his talents as a score and and then we saw\nIsabel shoot to I mean you saw him get after shot he can catch rhythms and he can pull up from anywhere on the court has got a quick release you got a pretty shot I loved his outlined in that in that exhibition because he didn't take very many shots and hit the ones that he did\nAnd he also had seven assessed and that's exactly what they want we know we can score how involved is the how committed to making his teammates better 'cause that's that's a dangerous dangerous guard if he can do that\nSo you don't see good when is the guy that's going to pile up a lot of assist then\nI think I think Jordan I think he could have scored more or less season if he wasn't whole dominating the ball so much in terms of ball handling I think is a bill was added to help get Jordan I think he's a better I think he's better off the guard I don't know that his true position is point guard I think you're better off if you have him\nUse him in that role less often and then and then have some mismatched with him he can go down in the post and post up ... he's a walking mismatch because of his strength so I I think you need to see is a bill will be the guy I think you're in a scene will be the point guard he was he ran point in most of the game in that exhibition\nYou don't think he's a ... you think is ... leading scores you I think he's going to take the lead school I think he could\nBut I don't think they want him to be focused on that I think they want him to be focused on facilitating the office in ... in running the floor and getting in getting teammates involved I think the scoring comes so naturally to him and there's going to be times when he catches a running in and shoot three shots and roll and that's okay\nAnd and there's going to be times when he catches a running in suits three shots and roll and that's okay but I think listening to Travis he wants to remain to be the guy who creates for others before he creates for himself and that could lead to him getting even better looks for himself\nLet's hear from Jordan good about being on the floor at the same time it's for me\nI feel like a ... a day to day life over the age of ... food over in the book or a really blame it on the pay off\nOur chemistry we talk every day oh we can make each other better play off each other so\nI think that and that comes back then too in a way position was basketball to where they're ... it's\nJust because one is designated a point guard does it mean that they're not going to be able to take some shocking to ride a bike Goodwin and so many other aspects to his game than yeah just the guy that's bringing the ball on the floor facilitator when I was struck me to a buck\nCould win last year and it didn't necessarily struck me about something he's about could do is that good when I had a triple double last year and he had a near triple double in another game he is capable of doing things across the board I don't look good when it's necessarily\nA leading scorer type but the nice thing about this building ... team is that you've got guys to feel\nIt all the rules check off all the boxes whether it's defense with French whether it's explosive moved to the room like a cardiac Gordon a ... there there are so many so many aspects of this team I feel like are covered which make like I said most anticipated season since Larry's used Twenty years ago I\nThink so because uh done like that's using which was all about Larry and it lived up to the bill and they went to the NC double a tournament to live at the ... oh I see what you did there well done\nBought this really kicked out man [laughter] [noise] this team is uh this is this is a complete team I I really do believe it and I'm I\nThis is this is a chance when there's a chance we're really going to get to see Travis forward with a full deck with with with all of the pieces because the first two years and it's been Travis trying to you know squeeze every last drowsy\nLiterally bring you brag over a but yes yeah every ounce of talent and the best thing I saw in in an exhibition so you've got to be careful here but here's what I liked what I saw on Saturday I saw a team that was playing downhill\nThat was attacking those taking trying to take charge charges and an exhibition game hitting a floor full loose balls or I saw the kind of intangibles that you you can't you can't really get a team to grow as the season goes on and they have it by now or they don't\nIf there's talented as we think they are and they play as hard as greedy as they have the\nPast two seasons with the talent deficit but that's a group that's a really good team because it's got talent and it's playing like it doesn't have it if that makes sense it's playing it it got talent there's a lot of ... a lot more water in that rag been ringing out but if they bring it out like that they're going to ... when a lot a lot of basketball games and I tell you what\nI was really impressed with card ear and he had points I mean he scored a lot of points of the game went on it got cut out of hand\nThen it kind of became up you know it almost like a like a scrimmage type field but when he first checked and he was the first playoff drives his bench\nTrial said after the game that he'd been running with the starters um they think she'll be a starter and uh and he had been sick past couple of days so we hadn't played as much in practice so he's not going to you know kind of he's got his rules and if you don't if you're limited in practice he's not going to start yet but it sounds like he thinks cardio is going to start\nThe big Asian right they were the bags and he was I I usually is when we gave gave up candy and now my neighborhood it's more like the kids are all gone so there nobody goes though it's like when things why we're doing the source of the dog and have fun so [laughter]\nWe as a uh like mean mini sized ... where you were like well OK here's a full king size butter finger enjoy [laughter] but yet how fun and now for me right now because I'm more like Christmas and you guys know ... again\nIt's fun and now for me right now because I'm more like Christmas and you guys know again November first official day that it's it's susceptible to listen to Christmas users as music\nDo you have a sports Halloween memory and like separate from a costume there's one for me\nBut I can recall where a big game happened on Halloween and I don't know why I remember it just kinda\nPopped in their Nineteen Ninety nine rams\nWere undefeated I think there were six you know heading into Nashville, Tennessee the play the titans\nAnd lost their first game of the year and he was missed was must feel go by Jeff Wilkins had a chance to either tighter winning rams news of course they end up playing the titans again but for whatever reason I remember that was on Halloween it was the rams first loss and it wouldn't have many more after that they lose to the lines I think the very next week\nAnd then they go on and it looks alliance it was in Detroit home field advantage was gone and\nIt was in Detroit and and and the and and I guess at that point they were starting to\nThere was you know maybe maybe some teams have figured out how to ah Detroit which was was halfway decent back in the day and that was was that at the very I guess that was still [noise] it's crazy to think about this that was still a year after Barry Sanders retired Algerian retired after the Ninety eight season correct you know he was already gone\nHard to believe it's been a and and we're coming up guys\nAnd we turned the calendar over to Ninety I was gonna be a year to celebrate his ... times will duties in for the big blue show a little bit later the night that we just celebrated you know twenty year anniversary of of of mark Maguire Seventy home runs we're coming up on celebrating the rams Superbowl season I don't care if the team has gone at something to celebrate one of the most memorable\nAh seasons in St Louis sports history\nAnd hopefully Jay ... went to a reminisced a little bit once we once we get there\nMy only following like

into\nLike a couple of weeks ago and that was that's never good for any sport\nRight and ... he's your cap that he's going to have to try to figure something out and\nIf a if he's if his plate isn't dramatically improve I I'm not sure how much this team a as a whole can improve news ... who's been on a chair and playing on the line with O'Reilly and Iran I mean these guys are ...\nAnd really clicked Saturday against the Chicago Blackhawks but Sanford is is you know quick to say hey let's let's not put the cart before the horse here we have it exactly turn this thing completely around\nYet [noise]\nSoda early I think I mean I'm kind of came out against Ronald same mind that I have to and [noise]\nAnd um [noise] you know a couple of days after that but uh\nYou know they were looking at going on and to the game tomorrow and if he is and kind of play the same way and maybe a vehicle to say that's a turning point build off onto\nThis I I think for everybody involved for fans for for Doug Armstrong for the team from Mike yo tomorrow is a real barometer real litmus test because you go up against a good Vegas team Chicago you know eat and you pointed out last week we both saw here's a team that gives up a ton of goals\nI first of all the first test was mix you score bunch of goes against Chicago you did that and you were able to win the game state it at your rival you hadn't beating him yet your political bunch already and you finally knock them off so that's key and and again for a team that's been struggling who cares you win just went and they did anyone considerably\nBut now for several days off and I and a lot of time to get well against three players healthy back tomorrow Jake Allen's been cleared who so sent back down so Allen is going to be good to go this is about as whole and healthy as the team has been\nGood to go this is about as whole and healthy as the team has been pretty healthy already but you know little bumps and bruises here you had an airfare Bree ready to go yet so now you feel like you've got a full team with several days to practice tomorrow is the game but they go out there and laying eggs against Vegas\nAnd then I think there's gonna be stuffed to work with where you can point to and say there's a lot wrong or off or you can point to a lot of things that happen well and it's an indicator of better things to come\nYou know one thing that happened when the last game was no Riley the Stanford ... that you mentioned earlier and I don't know how is that how's actually ever like being able to do this he lost his dad yeah just unexpectedly like how to even come back from that how would I Would be like a shock for a year\nAnd for a guy that we've heard so much about and I haven't seen them up on Jay's on the ice now\n... he was made is that it would be some though she trade exactly this wouldn't have been the time to be you point to and say now Sanford\nStarts to turn it on but we've been waiting for it and now maybe this is it and we'll talk to a gym Thomas More about what's the answer has been able to add to the steam coming up on a big blue show about seven oh five here tonight continuing on the ads and\nStuff for [noise] for the following night [noise] breaking news from college football\nOr within the last hour the University of Maryland is fired head coach DJ Dirk and just twenty four hours after it reinstated dark and the following an investigation off the field stuff\nPoor treatment of players and ultimately wound up in uh the untimely death of a player on the Maryland team just a bunch of terrible things are a team that usually\nThere we don't want to coach gets\nGets run by its administration or by the boosters or what have you [noise] you're gonna have one or two things
