rhetoric and attacks have been on the rise so give us a sense that that put that in contact since and how shocked you buy that\nWhile I think I was horrified my organization the country was horrified\nBy what happened yesterday but unfortunately in some ways we weren't necessarily surprised a deal on the frontlines of fighting hate for over a hundred years been tracking anti Semitic incidents\nFor for decades and what I can tell you is in twenty six teams we saw a thirty four percent increase access harassment vandalism and the violence against the Jewish community\nLast year eight fifty seven percent increase single largest surge that we've ever seen an anti Semitic acts in the United states [noise]\nAnd so this event that happened yesterday this terrible tragedy and our hearts break\nThe break for the families and the victims and the community\nBut let me tell you we should not look away what anti Semitism is on the rise to act\nAnd secretary Johnson I Know the idea of so this week showed a marked increase in online attacks against the Jewish community as we get closer to election day when you look at those statistics when you hear what Mr ... just said what is your sense of what's happening in the country\nFor smart for all Americans this morning should mourn me with the families of the eleven year old who were members of the tree of life is going to

that our leaders lead a secretary Johnson said\nEncouraged that the president said something yesterday the country needed to hear that but it is and what you say after the tragedy that only matters the environment that you create with your rhetoric and the ... we have spoken out one candidate Trump for President Trump\nHas invoked anti Semitic means and use the kind of rhetoric favored by white supremacist\nBut I think we also need to keep in mind and we'll keep doing that will keep speaking truth to power\nThought it's more than one man does whether you're an elected official meeting with Nazi sympathizers or bringing costs deniers to the house of representatives\nOr if you're in luck or candidate for office invoking wild anti Semitic conspiracy theories about\nJewish financier George

strategist former DNC chair Donna Brazil um nice at the top the shall we shouldn't be surprised by this all the events in this week we're the inevitable um\nI I think we should be surprised at something like this takes place in America and the course of the last week but I think much of its been predictable and this and with the times we're in and where we are today I'll quote the philosopher Yoda\nWhich says that pat the dark side is fear fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering and I think we're at a moment in time where we have to speak passionately clearly and calmly and and the times that we're in and I think our leaders and I would put specific responsibility on the president\nThat he has an obligation to try to read us so much of this tribalism and I think what he's done\n'em over the course of the last few years has helped form at this I'm not saying he's responsible for what happened in Pittsburgh is not responsible for what happened with the with the bombs that were sent he's responsible what happened with at the supermarket but all of those have commonality\nA white nationalist sub pharmacist shot to blacks at a supermarket white nationalist supremacists set Seventeen I eat these across the country to democratic leaders are white nationalist supremacist just killed eleven Jewish people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAnd in the course of that I think the president has not actually allocated resources to deal with it in the right way\nAnd he also has not spoken in the right way in the course of this that has diminished the eighth time\nHe had to work on domestic terror when you worked for president of the homeland security adviser how to respond\nWell I'm saddened to hear it all to be even this morning the lead into this was a focus on the part of the comments as he walked out a helicopter instead of the focus on the court I was hoping to see what she condemns anti Semitism and violence in this country is so hard to claim it got a big on the same way to make up for that was\nHis first response and that was his instinct is response to what happened what what do you then set in the speech was that was scripted\nFare and I don't believe that's accurate first off he has control over what scripted knows me knows you're saying that wasn't accurate that was his first or smile because it wasn't his first response was on his way out of response to a question throw it to him about gun control so the question was already political reporters and a dad or Sam what are your thoughts on gun control response to this issue\nIs actual response to the American people was that we have no tolerance for violence in this country or anti Semitism to the U.S whether you play it or not agree with me or not that's what I Would have ...\nTom when the child has an absolute parents\nThe other parents steps up their siblings steps up so that when the country has gone through a lot of pain and strike you look for the president to be that parental sick\nAnd yesterday I think at that moment when he was not the parent we need it he was not the person that she'll let's talk about the pain\nHe runs away from his responsibility as the leader will lead us we all have voices and his boss just a ... at the moment like this a mom and George when our leaders our former presidents with all of their party they were elected by the ...\nWell leaders our former presidents regardless of their party they were elected by the entire American people their their lives were at stake the lives of our attorney general the lives of members of Congress and the lives of people who are just regular people or people in the media people\nAt the table when you're talking to voters days away from the very important election if what they say if the country is in need of repair\nAnd what they want is a repairman for repair woman to fix this and I think the twenty twenty elections going to end up on this point people\nDo say that but do they do was\nTo back up what they say is one of my question\nDepends on who we're giving them and I think this is one of the key questions for twenty twenty is who who are the Democrats would then yes I think is right now we're still in our two camps and right now it's about getting them bowed out for this side or the side and it's either you're with this whole election day comes about Trump or you're with them or you're against them and then we'll see about how the turnout but\nThen they get back to the question what responsibility to political leaders have to encourage that and not have the opposite so there's so\nMany that are both sides moment I think anybody that that actually acts like this is both sides moments the president has a special responsibility at times like this I think the country out there as a whole is not as tribal as just what Washington is doesn't do politics the same as the president does does an access those two levels of pay\nAnd and discourse that he does but the president has a special ... per se possibility I'm not Michelangelo but I can paint by numbers and when you put string together the president's actions and use string together the president's words and use string together all those things he's done let's not forget to vet that what happened in Pittsburgh\nWas because was ... the man was radicalized\nBecause of the language of Hebrew immigrant aid society he was mad that refugees and immigrants forgive and we're giving sport ever he considered special privileges in the course of this and lead referenced the caravan let's let's also not forget that within this week\nThe president probably claimed himself a nationalist and proudly castigate the immigrants struggling families the refugees\nThat are walking miles and miles and as he does that not all Americans most Americans are good people and all that the president in my view the president has to come to terms with this and come to terms with his own responsibility and where we are as a country today\nJust briefly just not very much debris with and what you said what we should not lose sight of the fact\nThat this awful villains is someone who accused the president of being part of the Jewish conspiracy someone who sees the president has a global list was seeking to destroy the country\nAnd this is someone who is a noxious poisonous person believed ideas that unfortunately did not begin with one president or another anti Semitism pervasive dangerous threat and nations around the world instead of not Louis so it's not a whole lot why is it dramatically\nIn the last two years and the reason why he castigated the president this man was because he didn't think the president hated enough she didn't think the president was anti immigrant enough that's why he was mad at the president he thought the president was back in the bashing immigrants more\nThan ... more than I wanted and the fact that you have Jewish members of his administration were absolutely central to his larger political project he was deeply suspicious and I don't think you can really attribute this man's hateful is solely to one political party or another we\nYou know I I think a lot of the you know these ball players got to tell you the system still might be broken and and I I don't necessarily disagree\nWith that but you know what\nSome of these other players may have to get to that point you know as most and bet on yourself that's what we know is doing by the end up but he's going to be around what ten eleven million dollars if he is able to reach a lot of these plateau is depending on if it's it's\nIs able to reach a lot of these plateau is depending on if it's starting or relieving or closing where if he's again if he's the closer you know none of us are saying that's going to happen but he has\nPut some of those incentives in the contract where it if it works out and let's be honest it's not like the cardinals have a guaranteed closer right now\nAnd if Adam when rights not going to start\nAnd he's throwing like he did the end of this past season I wouldn't completely dismiss the notion of Adam Wainwright as you're closer I I just think some of these other big league ball players that are are putting a tight spot and Wainwright water been in a tight spot if he's elected to try and\nUh sell his services elsewhere nobody was going to go out there and give them any guaranteed money\nHe stayed here in St Louis and he's got a chance to ah to make pretty decent coin if he comes through\nI'm not the biggest fan of the winter I signed up for the money it's totally worth it you think of someone like little ... going to be making more that way right the next year to me that's all you need to know\n[laughter] I don't I don't know why you wouldn't be a fan of it I I what\nWhat else do you want them to give an opportunity at a guy that's been a career cardinal you would hate for his career to end anywhere else and to me well enough to take a chance the more pitching depth you have the better I don't think there's anything\nWrong with it I just worry that sense as Adam Wainwright that he's gonna get chances that he shouldn't casual treatment\nNow then and that's and that's a fair point but I I I don't think that's the way it's going to go with this particular with this particular team I think we're past that\nBut the hope his door for you okay if he doesn't work a starter forever middle reliever let's put it in in the eighth inning let's wait and I think you get a last chance this now to put him in places you have ... where you have fought before he will say hell no\nYou got Wainwright I'm starting pitcher now he's done to you I Am I re I'm and Wainwright type pitcher dies willing to pitch where wherever you want to put me wherever I go with to help the team win knowing or received a buddy in the postseason\nAnd and I think for a lot of guys you think 'cause I'm a reliever it almost I think a lot of guys in it but there was a time sort of recently where if you're a reliever was almost an insult if you're starting pitcher ham a stark\nYou've watched baseball here the last couple of years\nAre pitching in late relief it's pretty darn important even if you're not the closer and Wainwright saw that\nPart related and ... and was able to lay out some incentives were if he is a reliever\nAnd if he's a good reliever I mean heck if if you're if you're appearing in fifty or fifty five or sixty games probably means you've been a pretty effective and you've been durable at the same time and and Wayne writes gonna get winter it's going to get credit for that\nIs probably the best case scenario he helped to win any are there other any any ... got to say the\nWorst case scenario he just collects two million dollars and it's a good ... bench go just like that so the team doesn't lose as because there are enough or paying for a a superstar days if final year of a player less but frankly this is a swan song I think\nAnd yeah it's it's it's perfect storm for my what might be a good season for the cardinals us like that\nAnd you're absolutely right and we'll see how it all plays out but I think it's at this point anywhere really nothing but good news on the Adam Wainwright front let's hit one more little sports\nEarlier today sent a Jordan guy rue option to him about a scientific way back to their eight H. L. affiliate in San Antonio\nKyrie was one of those guys you had some really high expectations for because of how we played in the summer and the way he played in the blues minor league organization last year he uh did log in the ... and a couple of penalty minutes but the twenty year old not logging quite enough time to really be\nFeatured on any one blues line right now so you send him back down on a week where you're going to see a lot of\nInjured blues comeback or be at ... be at a shows cut off who is set to come back as well the lady who show could be part of the equation later this week and of course Gunderson is close to being healthy as well blues are\nJust I mean losing jak gallons of being hit but other than that defense but in Fort words you're about as close to being whole as as you're going to be is a big deal\nYet I think it's ... I think it's great that someone like probably February is basically going to he could apply again I mean we we didn't know if you'd ever play again after suffering too devastating ACL injuries and back to back season but how many times you hear a player coming back in those situations\nNot very many and I'm just I'm just anxious to see what he is who he is and because his game was about speed and it's and it's been being explosive\nIs that it does any remnants of that players still exist or can you rely on some of these you know his hockey skill set to change the type of player he is we're gonna we're gonna find out here real soon I'm anxious to see what\nThat looks like a ton other hand you have to feel sorry for feel bad for Jordan Cairo ... who I don't think he was given a fair look I mean he seemed like if he was playing well he would get bumped up to a different line if he wasn't playing while he been pumped out to different line he never seemed like he had a set\nPartnership with two other guys on the ice who he could could play with every single game I don't know if he got a fair look\nI think he's going to be okay and then you'll be back sooner rather than later [noise] ah I told you got because he has potential\nI don't disagree and I hope it's not a trend that we've seen with young players in the past where suddenly you just shut them off and you don't hear from them again and then you wonder well you just didn't live up to expectations while he's hardly played\nAnd hopefully he gets another opportunity sooner rather than later for the blues begin to Jake gallon situation up in the air and we we talk about the you know defense men and forwards you're just about all\nIt almost gives Mike your stay of execution for a while because you can't really judge this team without your starting goal to enter for who show comes in and just sets the world on fire and takes care of a lot of doubt because as of right now that there's ... ... gallons your guy almost by default\nJustice has blues ... and all over who's going to come into play well and they like uh what do we do [laughter] I\nWon a hundred percent agree this to me has got a lot of intrigue written all over it and all of the will is one game for who's going out there and starting [noise] you know given up a goal or are pitching a shutout and and the blues boost Twitter will go nuts lose fan base is going to lose their mind\nHe if he doesn't need to screw it up you doesn't screw it up so I got to see what happens\nIs that right what what ... what what are you going to screw up the seems awful [laughter] they don't give up and go oh there's there's zero pressure on who's a hero awful\nThing that the blues are shown off is the defensive side so yeah so\nEither he and I I I Want to nip that in\nThe site so yes so either he and I I I Want to nip that there because that's their their scoring goals partly because they're selling out on scoring they're they're they've become lackadaisical on these and this is self imposed\nFor the most part like yeah you still have the Cold War here defensively ... defense lawyers from the new they're they're very ... and it's basically so I get the officers struggle at early early this season but they got fixed three games\nPoint being is that she comes in and there she's not feeling some huge shoes Jake gallon on now is the guy but she's been just a guy really just been OK and a lot of that is because the defense has been awful\nLately you been able to give him more over ... but now it's got a shot to come in there and start and I'm telling all that will take is one game for him to go out there and you make thirty stays in the blues winter to wander ... you know one nothing dean this thing will turn on its head immediately and [laughter]\nIt'll make life for a Mike yo and and dug Armstrong difficult in a different sense to be a good problem to have but we saw this good problem last year and you still didn't make the Stanley Cup playoffs was all said and done\nThat just has to have trouble and all of our to me I think [noise]\nI don't know if it blues it's so blues where you can say hey you can have a goal in golden or come in and step up and you think it's a bad thing because it's going to cause a ... a bunch of\nA a a bunch of chaos inside the room nobody want nobody's looking forward to it but I'm telling you what they need somebody to step up\nBecause right now I Do the hawks you you said last week he's in the hawks all they do is give up golds that granted Crawford had been back and had been better but that to me that doesn't tell me a whole heck of lot Saturday Night the boys have been able to score goals", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "29"}
