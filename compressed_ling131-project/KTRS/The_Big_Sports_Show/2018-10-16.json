I'm Serious are paying attention really\nFascinating to me how little attention is being paid it seemed like everybody went for the ... scandal right\nAnd this is like a little hole scandal every time someone takes the witness stand I mean it it it's amazing what's coming out of this courtroom and in Manhattan these federal investigators are asking these questions and they flipped these\nThese witnesses and these even the even the people who are\nFacing federal charges are are are singing or [noise] or singing the blues of college basketball and it's like if if college basketball's being exposed for the for the ... pool that it is but no one will listen to that that really matter at all I don't know I mean you've got guys alleging payment of players that some of the programs in the country you've got\nWho are saying that didn't know about this yet there's Tex Mex thanking them for you know for for how from these runners and remember sprint and this is just the first of what should be three cases yeah this\nIs just the Adidas arm of the investigation I'm with the former Adidas officials\nAnd they uh a runner if you will and in ... and and he is basically you know that's just one part of it you still have the coach and none of the coaches had been involved yet and and if the ... those are settled or something you know I don't think they will be they'll get the court and there'll be a whole nother around will be at least two more rounds of this stuff and then remember\nEven though this is probably not going to result in federal charges that any of these guys will be a very\nCoach K to the things that they said today\nWhere they say well that's not the world that we live and we said she was just a blip on the radar that flying\nAnd and to not even acknowledge that there's problems is is that should be a black mark on their legacy as coaches\nYou don't have to come out and say yeah we get players this way to say this is an issue and I hope they get it they find a better way because it's just it's it's a it's an outright lie to anyone who's in college basketball who say that this is not the way it works\nAs anyone who's truthful and the game or around it will tell you that this is exactly how it works\nThe biggest thing about this testimony going on is that now no one can deny it because now everybody sees what you see if you go to in a tournament or talk to a coach off the record or even talk to a player I mean if you called up you know the players that is one of the best stories and the ones who are the NBA who wants to make it to the NBA\nWell actually let some of them go and tell them um but but this is exactly how it is and for those guys who say it's not as really a slap in the face anyone who expect the truth out of a\nOf a out of a publicly funded\nCoach I mean it's it's an embarrassing that those guys said what they said the\nTop of that then you you you we we get the you know continued to information out of ... where you had coaches and all the money why not and that's right after they got hit hard by a by hook or getting down there in ... and the news we hear about bill self\nPotentially calling one of these are the Adidas representatives thinking him a ... a commitment to the program he's now a sophomore there in Kansas and certainly implicated bill self is a big deal do you think that's a big deal does\nDoes or does come back around and and uh and he can just fired right smack dab in the ... before it's all said and done but\nI thought I thought when the when Kansas was involved at all and miss 'em and Adidas was was going to be headed toward a trial I honestly my prediction is that bill stuff was going to go to the NBA because if it is this going to be involved you better believe that Kansas was going to be met you\nAnd sure enough now Kansas is now ... the the the runner who testified went out of his way to say the bill self at no knowledge of what he was doing\nUm he also there was proof in court that that the bill self sank to beat us for after a player committed so [laughter] I mean it was he thinking I'm for it right the biggest unanswered questions and it's being asked to bill south and in Lawrence and the only answer he's giving is you know typical political\nBill self where it's kind of sucks guys I Wish I could tell you if I could but I can do this truth will come out and I just tell you just chocolate cover our practices and we're going to then we're going to you don't have a real good\nOh come out and I just tell you just chocolate cover our practices and we're going to\nThen we're going to you don't have a real good team at right now forget about this in March and and we like it and it's it's it's it's really good but also because people buy it it's a good ... I Believe that thank you [laughter] the family certainly wants to believe that but you know it's it's impossible to wrap your brain around\nBill self not knowing about this it's impossible to wrap your brain around bill self thanking Adidas or after the commitment of a player and I understand what he's thanking them for it's really impossible for me to believe that bill self and get snow look got dinner together\nEither it sounds like the night before if not very soon a celebratory dinner before bill self goes into the college basketball hall of fame but if you were getting inducted to the to the hall of fame and you're you know had a few people you're going to get dinner with the night before ... ... you're not getting dinner with someone that you know a lot about\n[laughter] I mean it's very hard to know\nIf there is no smoking gun right now and that's what Kansas fans are going to keep bringing up and and I get that but it's just hard to believe that they didn't know about this um the more that comes out and that's not over yet and\nThen it's real easy to slam sanctions down on programs like your boy a Donny Jindal in in southern miss\nFrom a few years ago a and then let programs like North Carolina remember that academic investigation and Hubbard over them for about five years nothing ever came of it\nThat's garbage a ... and now there's a with Kansas yeah they'll go out there do start the year thirty you know their team is actually this year an air re buddy will forget about this in the NC double a will miraculously forget about this as well try to find one of these little schools\nThat may be some sort of tie into this and you'll get slammed with the two year sanction or ... or something crazy again maybe ... will will will be the sacrificial lamb and all of this\nBut then I think we all know schools like Kansas schooling North Carolina\nThey some hall at the end of the day come out of things like this on skis and it's just sort of par for the course without the NC double a handle this and again this is an NC double a investigation yet it's just all the FBI but like you said\nThis is all stuff that is supposed to be on the ... desk by the time this was all over with a with these again\nOne trial now in two wars while still coming down the line\n... and and I don't I'm not surprised that Mark Emmert that has not acted because I think it makes sense ... investigations surely out and then take all of your evidence and go for the throat because if you act now you're going to influence the next two trials\nUm so I can get sitting back when I don't get as I think we're just for the purpose the presentation of Mark Emmert should be there\nI think he should have a president there it doesn't if you're not there every day I think he should have paid the parents um because I have a committee to feign shock and outrage when this investigation started to not show up in that courtroom to meet tells me about your priorities\nI'm also a stun they are the pack twelve commissioner go on the record and said that he doesn't think that that's the problem in the sport\nWhen schools are littered with references holy ...\nTrial a that was that was laughable to me I mean these these these people these guys they make so much money\nOff these athletes of these sports that anything that threatens them they just ... I mean they're they're just they're just they just flat out lying to our faith is hoping that the house doesn't come crashing down around them because yeah it's got its problems but we're getting paid and you know and that's all that we care about right now\nI think until there is some sort of reckoning for it's always going to be what can we do to keep the keep the thing ...\nAnd and that's a shame because it again the guys who get punished\nOr the people who you know who who tried to do the right thing and everybody else you know sheets and look the other way and and and they all get by and and the and the except for the players who only you know a sliver of them actually make it\nTo the pros and everybody else you know get the degree that hopefully they actually learn something from I mean it's really it's there are layers how screwed up but it is and the fact that it's ran oftentimes but people who want to look the other way is\nA is the worst part of it you mentioned ... I mean there's a very good case I thought Dan Wetzel and I'll compliment Dan he's not an outstanding job covering that's\nThe only person the only national media member\nUm I think the Adams the gory there's ... freelancing for multiple outlets than what's been there I think every ... every day for the most part and he's turning out compelling columns and coverage from the from the trial he pointed out that\nThat image wasn't there you also point out that you could be talking about like a literate or a legitimate case where the death penalty for a little breeze and being that they have testimony now of a of a ... assistant coach handing over a bag of money to do a process to a prospect\nThat at the gas station I don't know because it happens all the time was the big deal when the incident like this crushing exactly four or ... or treating prospect some players to strippers and sex acts during the recruiting is like that it just ... yeah\nAnd now you've got to assistant coach handing over money at a gas station meeting I mean talk about a disregard for the agency that way I mean that should be that should be when the NC double A. brings hell fire down and usually in the past that's when they do is when they feel like they've been taking advantage of twice\nThat's what happened to Donny tend to lead Tennessee he had broken the rules in the past he broke up again and they put them in the candidate shot him\nAnd his tenure show costs territory he was Bruce ... of they don't like when you when you when you do it twice yeah what was going to have to face the ...\nAnd ... and then there's sort of not the sacrificial lamb because they will it will have earned ... any ... any and every ... that gets handed down didn't but that'd be the type of thing where they make a ... you know they make a case\nAnd they make a show on ... and then everybody else like that you know the Kansas is of the world than any other big name program they might be involved in this maybe they get a slap on the wrist and or the ... and walk away scot free I mean we all know that for sure but this is going to be fascinating to watch because\nIt it it really is just starting even though most folks\nDon't really want to pay attention to it yeah\nYeah I'm I I think I'm ... I'm just shocked and more people aren't\nAren't don't seem to be following it if you bring it up in a bar and a sports bar in a conversation people look at you like you're crazy like they don't know what you're talking about you know maybe something happens that makes it that big of a deal but I thought Kansas coming up this week was going to be a very big deal and uh it certainly is among some Missouri followers are\nYou from man doesn't but in terms of the national spectrum\nI don't I don't feel like it's been talked about all that much\nUh and maybe it's because Rick Pitino is already gone for ... like that to know beating a dead horse to an extent but to me it it it's going to get it's going to get bigger and bigger um and maybe the people who are paying attention to it now or in on the ground floor but I'm telling you when when there's federal crime hanging over people said they don't care about who they rat out\nYou know a long long time ago there was the the guy in Kansas City who was in tight with the rush brothers and he was given an enormous benefit\nThis one because both are coming off the edge and really disrupt some things without that presence\nAnd you're going to give that quarterback for produce that that has been arm a chance to pick you up to ... yeah I mean and that's been the Achilles heel for Ohio State is they give up the big play in the back into that the fence and [noise]\nIt would because they just haven't had that pass Russia with both on the sidelines and\nLook what this weekend is showed us again [noise] Georgia number two in the country goes to LSU Walla Walla in death valley\nUndefeated no more [noise]\nAnd that was just [noise]\nThat was just a stark U. dub goes to Oregon they lose that overtime Washington [noise] Washington and maybe the pack twelve in big big trouble\nFor a shot at getting to the college football playoff I think I think their chances rested with Washington I don't see it to last pack twelve teen getting to the playoffs\nA fact twelve is going to look at one one game and that is at Stanford Oregon game\nWhen Oregon all's you got to do\nIs ... is Neal\nYou've got to win instead\nYear run it turned over stand for turns around and scores now you got the ... not that good I mean it's not Oregon is that going to be in position at the end of the year to to get a lot of the play offs but at least there's a conversation you're Oregon hold on for that game\nNow honestly I don't see a ... twelve team even in a conversation\nWashington needed it and what we're Washington though even before that as they looked up and they saw great Auburn last home the tendency ha ha and there's another example ... well ... and that's that's bizarre and it it makes the SEC look like it did last year\nWhen it was Alabama and everybody else now granted they still got George end of the playoff\nGeorgia one the SEC championship but of course Alabama was the one that's not in it but we still set it last year was Alabama and everybody else and I think we're starting to feel that way again is anybody really feel like Kentucky\nIs legit contender here of course not Georgia got exposed and it was sort of a problem George had against Mitt Xu ... could expose the tigers couldn't fix allowing the big place and they gave up too many places make too many mistakes put in Georgia cannot\nMove the football consistently there often is not very good\nAt it and at this point they've seriously gotta consider making a change so that number one recruited biggest fields yeah who's the number one quarterback recruit in the country if he's not going to take over that position for from because Georgia's got play makers goal war and they cannot move the football consistently\nNo you're exactly right in fact I heard the conversation earlier\nToday and it was okay when you finally put fields in\nFor more than a play here rather play there and ... you know in a goal light situation or\nThird and short situation I think you know you've got to pull the trigger on that if you're Kirby Smart you got to go with fields right now if you want any possible way to salvage winning this division because now you look at what Florida is done [noise]\nKentucky's hanging right there [noise] the FCC eased is up for grabs and if Georgia wants that piece of the pie [noise] to get to the FCC championship you're not going to get it from you're going to get it with fields we\nMake a big deal about the running back position ... a very interchangeable in in football in general high school college NFL while Georgia watched new job and Sony Michel walk out the door Sony Michel looks like the best rookie one of the old rookie running back down the NFL after what he did last night\nFor the New England patriots running between the tackles bouncing to the outside catching the football a lot of the backfield because she can do it all\nAnd may be Georgia you know they they they get and they've got talent and running backs the war but they're not making plays in and George is not done yet\nThey can still their destiny still in their hands losing at LSU there is no shame in that but the way they lost and basically being dominated fourth quarter rolled around and they were toast that was that was pretty shocking to see I there was no question about\nThat it just got ... and others say right now this LSU team say what you want about it orange or on as a coach I Know they wanted to run him out on a rail last year homage to right now he [noise]\nIf they do what they think they can do the rest of the way here's your national coach of the year without any doubt about it\nYou know ... everybody knew that they were dead Alabama was going to do this do Ohio State was going to be where they're at everybody knows constantly be where they're out there are a lot of people doubt on al issue at the beginning of the season and add or Iran has proved a lotta people wrong with that tiger program\nYou finally find a quarterback two boroughs down arrows go there and\nLSU they've ah that defense has been strong and suddenly that LSU bam a game looks like the in the country again like it used to be year in year out not that long ago I mentioned top twenty five ... top ten\nYou're in you're out not that long ago I mentioned top twenty five ... top ten teams losing on the road West Virginia falling at Iowa State number sixteen Miami losing at Virginia [noise] it\nWas a it was an epidemic I bought the number eight Penn State losing it home to Michigan State there were all sorts of stats on Saturday and the one that came really close was over five Notre Dame against pets and\nNotre Dame survives to fight another day and still SARS I'm concerned they went out there in ... and ah there's a there's no argument\nWe talked about it last week certain things happen yes Notre Dame is in Georgia losing that puts Notre Dame right smack in the conversation [noise] um and really Notre Dame [noise]\nThey they escaped I mean I saw bits and pieces of that game on Saturday hit I'll play them for three quarters Notre Dame finally turned it on and the fourth quarter got the score when they needed it then they got the defense of stops [noise]\nBut [noise] Notre Dame schedule the rest of the way is very very good for down it's\nIt's very manageable and their Notre Dame the biggest Michigan fans in college right now because of Michigan continues they're all like they're rolling that win for Notre Dame that could be by the time it's all said and done that could be a top five when\nI'm going to tell you that when that ... you know I I really thought Wisconsin was going to was going to give them a better game on Saturday Night even I was I was\n... when that when that spread got the pin I was nervous and I and I stayed away from it but I figured that ... the only thing I Wonder what are the only thing I was concerned about was okay Wisconsin they were a top ten team preseason top ten most of those pieces are still there was constant [noise]\nHe's not who we thought they will not at all they are not as good as ... and ... you know what you got room to improve\nMichigan this is\nThis is by far the best Michigan is played under Harbaugh Patterson is making some place they're running the ball like\nThey've never run it before either this was a team that usually averaging around for yards per carry their bursting through the line right now the running the ball and the defense might be the best in college football that's not named Alabama they\nThey finally got a quarterback that can do a lot of different things in Paterson and that's exactly what they did the other night Patterson is now starting to get very comfortable in his ... and when you ask him running at our appeal\nIt opens up a lot of different things and I tell you what beginning of the year\nUptick Ohio State Michigan it's probably going to be another Ohio State victory to Amish kids playing right now [noise]\nOhio State better hope that they both say is back for that game I don't like how states last two games I never liked to Michigan State Michigan back to back but now you look at what Michigan State did then you look at what Michigan's been doing\nI'm telling you Ohio State may have the toughest schedule\nLeft out of it out of that group of top five top six teams left you know other than the Alabama LSU game [noise]\nThese games for the buck eyes are going to be monster moving forward and yeah you're exactly right Notre Dame they got they just got to get on that\nWolverine bandwagon week in week\nOut their huge Michigan fans right now there's no question about it ... they're huge fans of getting out of this stretch of gauntlet that feature the number two team in the ... in America the number one team\nIn America Alabama with Missoula in Tuscaloosa on Saturday Night\nWhen I was the right side [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] or Alabama final story it\nWas all ... for the most part after the tigers hung in there in the first half Alabama is the best team in America for a reason and [noise]\nFive K.

A. of course a number one where the bullet with twelve first places votes a seven and one record the CBC could debts are leaving no doubt as they dispatched ah [noise] now number four at the time number three case Iraq her\nCBC is going to be your number one team in the state after the regular season they they have a by week this week the team that they were supposed to play out of Columbus ohio having a lot of issues from what I'm understanding a so they're not playing that game now so CBC gets the week off\nGet sticky all up after the the gauntlet if you want to call it that but they pretty much read everybody out on that gauntlet except for St john's college uh but yeah the BCS your number one team they are going to end up number one and the regular season a leaf subtle west with a you know just having a great year\nUsing a leaf subtle west within you know just having a great year and you're gonna see at least some a western rockers battle um when it comes to see who's gonna come out of Kansas City eureka\nWow I mean they drop from two to three after they lost to mark cats and a terrific game from our cat this past Saturday Night and that shows you just how strong is the top four and then everybody else in the polls this week\nThough you recon rockers you mean yeah I mean the Reagan losing rockers losing I mean there's like CBC and everybody else to me well I mean but what I'm saying is you know typically if you're the number two team and you lose to a non\nRanked team you're going to tumble a little bit more in the poll here if you're not seeing that because once again it's just how solid those top four but you're exactly right\nThrough eureka lost someone on ranked team\nYeah and they and they only drop one spot and you you know a lot of people still think you ... better than the ... who is the number five team a lot of people think rockers is better than rock bridge the Smiths better than Iraq but I mean there's you know a whole lot of things that go into it but it's the BCS wrote in classic let's just\nOnce again it's great to see and I see the as back to where they were about five six years ago where when Michael shear played for them in a lot of those other guys\nI'm you know they're they're gonna have to they're going to run into do at some point and that's going to be a terrific game on the side of the state without any doubt I think those are the two teams on this side in that upper bracket that everybody's going to be looking at\nSmith feel ... springs nine Borgia in at ten and seven one Hannibal drops out shooting him all receiving from seeing them drop out uh they're receiving a couple of votes in at six in to anything else there from the bottom half in class for\nThe status quo for the most part Borgia with another you know taking care of their business do build a house\nI'm you know doing it with a quarterback that you know didn't get a lot of snaps last year and they're they're just taking care of business they're only lost several point defeat to Colorado River last week and so you you got to keep 'em ranked there\nBut once again I think you know their Borgias one that I Know is is stock in our cities side\nUh so that's you know that's going to be a tough road for them\nI was like a class three J. P. and we split the first place votes Odessa was sick with six but Odessa with two more points than trinity there are number one\nSomebody had to put trinity and third spot\nThis week I don't know why I don't know how but last week they had a hundred and eleven points this where you've got a hundred and ten points\nBut no I I think you're seeing the collision course you know obviously trinity and Ritter are going to be battling and the district final uh that's I think you can pretty much in the immortal words of Seth Davis you can Sharpie that one ... I'm On your bracket [noise]\nUm I still think Odessa trinity is just on an absolute collision course for Columbia the way those two two teams are playing right now\n... three Maryville forecast feel fired the top half their J. P.\nNot a lot of shake up not a lot of changes their um you flip Mary villa casts a bill or because of um of no cats will actually moved up excuse me um [noise]\nBut you know you look at that top five minutes of the top five is you're going to see a lot of people think oh deaths in Maryville is going to be a terrific match up possibly on that side of the bracket\nI I'm looking forward to seeing what Mount Vernon is going to do I've been high on Mount Vernon all year they had that little slip up mid season\nBut there are super talented team and that number six fought so it gets interesting especially in the bottom part of that you know top ten this week\nUh Mount Vernon and six or seven in one the bulldogs from saint Clair seven and we want it number seven southern Boone an aide Springfield Catholic nine Kennett moves into the top ten with a seven and one record\nYeah and not a lot of people have heard a lot about Kennedy this year this kind of team is really good down in the Boot Hill um they do a lot of great things and it's good to see them back in the poll but\nWhen you look at the receiving vote side of the things in class or it's the most out of any class because I think there's a lot of parity yeah after number one and number two I think the parity is just unbelievable after that\nLutheran St Charles among those teams ...\nYear I mean you know yeah they got they got trucked last week by trinity but you know what the Lutheran St Charles having a terrific gear or could could make it pretty decent run but you know you look at some of the other teams that are sitting there Pleasant Hill Pembroke hill\nBut you know you look at some of the other teams that are sitting there Pleasant Hill Pembroke hill eight no only getting one vote I mean look at let's just see where this whole thing turns out but a lot of parity in class three after number one and number two\nThe best one to combination I still believe is in class to do more and Blair oaks the more obviously sweeping the first place votes but Blair oaks I tell you this if they were stealing class three Jimmy called I think they'd be the number one team\nI think I think ... ... S C I\nThey don't they they make some noise oh I think they would be ahead according to whether I'll\nTell you that much right now but yeah I mean\nThat could be a that's going to be if it happens I think they're on the same side of the brackets\nUm you know it's going to be very interesting late throw up having a terrific year Lutheran north beat and everybody you know in Missouri that they've played um after their first three games they get tested this week do they get shot but not on friday night so that'll be an interesting match up\nYou know for Lutheran north but you know Lutheran north is going to have a lot of hurdles to get over if they want to make it to Columbia and I think the biggest thing is going to be the depths if they can keep healthy stay healthy\nAnd do things that they can do and that move people round up front\nAnd run the ball successfully then they're going to be okay and you could see Lamar Lutheran north again this year but this isn't going to be the easy road for Luther north they've got a lot of teams that they're going to have to take care of\nThat certainly appears to be the case um Lawson and at five and then the rest of the class to Monroe city make in court county evil and Lexington moving into the top ten where the seven and one record Palmyra still receiving votes but they drop out\nYeah I Am ... they'll Palmyra last I Believe they lost to a court county this week so that's where they drop out I'm not a whole bunch of different things they're able moving in Lexington seven and one\nI'm having a terrific year so not a whole lot of changes Lexus receiving votes last week knew that they were going to move in what's Palmyra last\nSo let's shift gears to class one J. P. and our final look at the top ten for the week hate Thai getting eleventh probably twelve first plays votes followed by say yet to be Ken and more saline and pierce city\nThe status quo as it's been um you know hate Thai\nWow are they just a very very good football team um you know fade getting at number getting a vote somebody swinging a vote towards them you know east bloc is good marks Salinas terrific pierce city is really good west trend last last week so that's why you see them drop all the way from two to six\nValley Catholic actually moves up one I think\nYou do a lotta people hit the panic button on valley Catholic when they lost appear earlier this year but they've kinda battled back nicely but this isn't your typical valley Catholic team they you know they're young\nStill learning a lot I'm not sure if this or the team that can make a deep deep run but you got to keep your eye on him\nNo question about it a western valley Catholic Lincoln cast midway in Milan to round out the ten\nYeah there's no change is really at the bottom just a little bit of shuffling around a you know point why isn't all that fun stuff but not a whole lot of changes in Scotland county receiving a few votes here and there\nThat's your powers I bring that we see ... will at some of the final big shake ups that could happen in district play maybe look at the district standings in our final segment the J.

Berkeley and ... the biggest thing that struck me on this whole deal is ... it's about time some positives come\nOut a little down of not only\nJust high school ... athletics but um you know Josh ... the doors county area is just she's screaming for positives you know you've\nGot trinity football having a great year Luther north having a great season and then you get this you get a great story about some some kids that write a letter in talks about how their coach treats them and how they're so you know they're they're they're blessed to have somebody in their ... and it's just awesome to see\nKids just want to be kids and um\nFor the most part kids are kids and uh they're they're doing things that are just any other normal kid would do and and uh you know the the bad stuff which is you know point zero zero one percent uh that that overshadows all of the ... the positive news\nThere are some some some coaches and some people out there that that think that that high school athletics is a job\nOr is it needs to be approached in certain ways you hit it on had\nWe need to like kids be kids yeah we want to give them structure we want we want to give them the discipline we want to do different things but I think everybody should look at the story behind all of this typical or south Berkeley and what coach round is done\nAnd take a page out of that book because you know it's kids being kids it's kids enjoying the game\nAnd succeeding and everybody's got to remember high school athletics is just one chapter of these students' lives a lot of these kids aren't going to go on to play college football a lot of these kids aren't going to go on to the next level we got to make sure that they're being successful\nIn the classroom in their communities in to see a story like this it it's just it it it makes me as a guy that's been covering high school sports for ever\nIt makes me very happy and it puts a smile on my face because hearing all the bad and all the negative and all that kind of stuff it's good to see some great positive stuff coming out of what coaches are bringing to their their their student athletes\nWill said sure that your powers are
