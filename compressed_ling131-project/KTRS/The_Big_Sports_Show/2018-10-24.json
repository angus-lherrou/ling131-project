Porter how you look Saturday Night at the zoo madness following a homecoming win against Memphis everybody excited about the Missouri Tigers and nice football when and John to Puerto looked every bit\nLike the five star recruits you was when he arrived at the zoo last year you know that\nThat uh the first year after ... classifying there were moments of inconsistencies were each will be looked like a kid that was a that she would have been in high school\nAnd then the moments where you showed the incredible skill set well\nHe uh he brushed up on that skill set ... and ... and looked\nThe part of a potential uh dare I say all American Saturday Night and then\nSunday the scrimmage against the salute ... ah it all comes crumbling down\nTough um especially considering how you know not not so much what you saw on Saturday but but what he said and he talked about last season and multiple times during his career he had the you know the ten tonight is the pain in the knees that really kinda grounded him and\nHe was bringing it up because it was gone finally and you saw it and how we can dunk or we could jump the exposed to this was there that we hadn't really seen last season he had trained transformed his body a bit that's babysat that he had last year was off\nAnd really he looked like a guy who was going to be to me in my opinion one of the most underrated players in the country and during this college basketball season\nAnd even in the scrimmage even in the secret scrimmage he looks good man I talked to somebody who is there is a man he was really impressive until the injury and at that moment you know everybody draws their breath and you hope for the best and it turns out to be the worst things helped often\nYou know one of the things that jumped out to me I could and the comments paper there's still time left on the clock and the scrimmage when he went down and there was basically\nThere's still time left on the clock in the scrimmage when he went down and there was basically a decision to be made to they want to keep playing they want us to have this was over let's go home\nUm and and they decided to keep playing and they they finished up in a strongly one by fourteen and that's you know it is a secret scrimmage so we don't know any of the details of ...\nWho played well are you know who ... who didn't but southern Illinois a good team um and picked up finished third in the Missouri Valley loaded with seniors loaded with experience should be one of the berries ends of the best team\nThat is going to have their um so that's not a nobody in the fact that they finished wanted to finish unfinished drunk to me\nIt kind of an example of this team's character look these guys know that one guy doesn't make or break your season they learn that first hand last year with Michael and losing jobs is a big deal and you know we can talk about all the reasons that's the case\nBut you know this does not mean that they're season's over they have too many guys who have been through too much to to have that mentality you know Kevin per year has been I think he's had\nNo more teammates on that team I'm alec shift for breakfast against they started a great story about just the amount of guys he's played with\nOver the course of his career he's she's seen them all come and go\nAnd uh you know you Jordan guys to gets ripped on by everybody but it's still one of the leaders of this team um they they're going to be and these guys together and make this team put their best foot forward now they need some luck need maybe a transfer to to come ... that'd be nice I Need Jeremiah Tilghman to really step his game up the spotlight just found him in a major way\nBut uh you know they're not going to roll over and curl up and die tons of Martin teams don't do that and I guarantee you he's already preaching to these guys look you know it's up to you to define the season's going to go it's not up to John\nJohn taste bad need to define it for us\nI you know you you brought a great point with with these with the history of condo teams and first of all the frame it to where I'm where I'm kinda thinking this is going to go and we've had some conversations I was\nHesitant to project this tiger team much further than Seventeen or Eighteen wins with John ... in the wind up you take him out\nAnd for guy that's expected to be banned the centerpiece of the often it's I I didn't see Porter is a you know Seventeen Eighteen points per game guy I saw him you know Thirteen\nHow many figure that one on which which I get well at it and it helps your point that the that the again Smith Brothers not related are are are going to be a ... there's at least a fighting chance especially with especially with drew ... with Marty Simmons haven't gotten fired Evansville\nA that door really appears to be open and he would be a\nDoor appears to be open so big Marty Sims could walk through it let's just say that man let's just say that pregnant oh\nOkay I ... that's the way I made a\nLot to say that guy no way I don't have already coaching somewhere I don't know how that they don't let that kid\nPlay play for this team if if they do I'd be shocked if they don't I'd be shocked but it's the NC double A. so when people say well there's a precedent I Know but it's the NC double a\nIn the NC double a does some funky things every now and then I don't think there's any question about it but that ... that freshman class being now\nAlmost I mean it's there's Tillman right now right I mean to bite unless I'm missing somebody I'm certainly no impact guys from last year that that you brought in or around right now that you lose almost her entire freshman class from your first year it's up\nIt's going to make the process is going to do and I think people need to understand that ah I\nI I think it's more than reasonable your point is valid that that this team could or could over achieve and really exceed expectations by the time it's all said and done but let's be realistic here\nHere's a chance this thing is a is not very appealing to the eyes of this year and unfortunately it's just you know kind of part of the deal or as you try to um again I realized that type of shape the program was in ... got here\nAnd I'm not ready to say that it's going to be going to be bad for the ads this year I'm just a a\nA tie that and I think are you from the beginning I think\nWe need to see what happens I mean I I really think with what we've learned about\nThese guys some of these guys from last year is that\nYou know they are going to get better as the season progressed as they're going to respond when when adversity hits and they're going to have to be scrappy and they're going to have to catch some breaks but I'm not convinced that I'm not convinced today that they're going to be a bad team this year\nUm they've certainly had a pretty big wrench thrown in their system here but I'm not convinced that they're going to be that you're going to be there's gonna be a massive step back this year I'm I'm not ready to go there yet I Do think yes\nIt's important to remember what this program is still digging itself out of\nI mean it wasn't that long ago that this was the worst time major college basketball team in the country and it wasn't even close yeah talking about on results on court results not what's going on up the scenes or you know we can talk about which programs were dirty and all that sets your thing about quality level of basketball\nAbout which programs were dirty and all that sets your thing about quality level of basketball\nQuality of talent roll up the ball play a game this was one of the worst teams in college basketball no argument you know when it didn't go to you in case you can get ... and when convincingly remember that's how bad it was\nSo you know yes it takes time to dig yourself out of that you have to try to pursue some quick fixes you have to take you know you have to you have to you know\nBust your butt to try to sign Michael Porter junior and you know even when his back gives out it's still it's still a win because every other player that that he\nYou know was watching him seasons you as an option I mean you're talking about really digging yourself out of something really bad here and it was bad for three years so it's going to take some time I think what you can look at though\nIf you want to see which direction this is heading look at the players that are coming\nLook at the Jeremiah till means they'll look at some of the guys that have looked at the memorial McKinney is you know these guys were coming to the zoo oh there's no doubt I mean so you're going to I'm not going to sit there and tell you the kinds of Martin's going to win the national championship but ... but I'm going to I I Am going to tell you that he's going to recruit the state and outside of the state\nWell enough that this team is going to be competitive every season under him now will it be competitive when it loses its best player to uh snapped ACL secret scrimmage right before the season starts that's going to be a bit of a grind here\nBut I but I still think they're going to be a tough minded team that does things in a competitive fashion I think there are only going to get better I think in the end\nI think the Puerto saga will be remembered as kind of a big what ifs probably but it will also be remembered as a you know part of the thing that helped launch to really successful run for coach Martin I'm a zoo\nBut would you agree that when when Michael got here and\nYou knew that it was going to probably be whether he played last year not when we got here and everybody was he's healthy he's good to go I think we all assumed Michael was going to be one and done and I think it was at the time fair to sink was who might make the tournament this year\nAnd then maybe step back here too and then Michael helps generate that recruiting buzz and by the time you get to years three four and five this thing's going to be clicking I always thought year too was going to potentially be that bumping the road now obviously the John ... news just helps a\nMix that possibly more of a reality like you said big picture this season no matter what the results are if the results are\nNot great that that ... there's no way that's an indicator of what the years down the line or going to be\nNo I uh I agree and I think I I just maybe I'm maybe I'm Crazy maybe we're here\nYou know a year from now and I'm apologizing to ... to people for being a you know like ... minutes about this team after after Johnson goes I just think they're competitive fiber is going to be stronger than a lot of people are gonna are gonna think and I think if anything\nCoach Martin will take the fact that people are throwing their hands over there and stand season's over and turn it into a weapon for this I've seen him do it I've seen him do it when John naming got hurt at Tennessee and they lost their you know there was one of their all SCC\nA team members you know they were they won twenty games that next year they didn't make the tournament but they won twenty games without but we'll be described as their best player I seen him do it in his best season ever when John ... was stapled to the floor because he had no knees he's now a graduate assistant ... you'll see him he's the one who's walking around the sideline looking in more pain than than Michael Porter senior\nAnd and they went in and and pulled you know turned a five hundred season into a sweet sixteen run after everybody in their in their town wrote him off and there was a petition to get the coach fired I mean he takes one of his skills is taking you know negative energy and turning it into fuel that that can fire up a team\nThis team will be under talented the SEC is loaded I see it all I see what's I see it all on the wall but I'm just learned that you don't you don't say you never count you never count one of his teams out before you see what it can go out there and do\nNot one guy can replace Jon ... know what\nYou package per ear in ... years develops bird can score I didn't [noise]\nTo me prayers that dark horse to lead this team in scoring when it's all said and done Fifteen fish I think that's because you can shoot a temporary and shoot and free throw line you know you make three rows exactly right the free throw line is we're ... money but you were ... years off since\n... defense in rebounding and a guy here's my ex factor in its cage a Santos the link the athleticism what Kenny he bring in sort of those\nThe numbers that don't show up always on the box scores you know deflection may be a maybe defense down there in the blocks can he can you get your healthy because he's dealing with a foot injury right now\nAnd that that that's why I think he's even more of an X factor and more of an unknown nobody's really seen him he's a Jew coat guy I think initially was up in Illinois Chicago way back when um\nCan you get this guy to contribute some of those type of stats bending then truly I think you've got potentially three guys that can to get there may be replicate what one gigantic could do\nYeah everybody you know everybody has to to do a little bit more throw you know you throw read Nico in there he doesn't need to be a hero but he can get out there and\nYou can get into a minute it's made of or get you I mean it's going to you're going to need bodies you're gonna honestly need bodies that it's going to be an all hands on death rows\nAnd that might be you mentioned earlier like what has to change coaching wise extras knows wise I wander\nSitting here today not having talked to coach since John ... injury I Wonder today if if his challenge is yours to be more willing to play a deeper bench\nI'm so Johnson's out right so you have to have guys who you know everybody has kind of fell into create that that impact he's the oldest he's usually played with a pretty short benches the season rolls along I Wonder\nIf this season is more about maximizing your roster having some guys who can come off the bench and have a role that maybe in the past would be more of a reserve can you can you rely on more bodies as you try to find some sort of concoction that helps you replace the whole that John too left behind that is just off the top of my head I wonder if that's something that\nYou know we we hear about is ... involving more people to try to make up for for his absence\nHe's ... he said it last year this team shots threes like no other kinds of Martin team has ever done\nAnd he was willing to be almost a complete one eighty from what his teams at Cal these teams at tendency in Missouri state looked like she is shown he's willing to adapt to the personnel he has on the floor I Wonder band like ... you're talking about coming up with some sort of concoction what can he come up with\nReady for a bad cold and flu season the best way to tell it's the flu is that the flu brings a fever so be prepared with a mom or you can trust the samples scanner ... backed by more than Seventy clinical studies

bits with him and then and then and then bring 'em to us here on on the on the evening show\nNo it just depends on how much coffee I've had [laughter]\nBecause I Want to talk to him about sports I fight with him but if I just want to go on auto pilot and listen to him ran I just bring up pace of play right and then I just tune out pay to play or when they scheduled games yeah he's a big ... late into the ... and I just see starts yelling and I asked zone out [laughter]\nYou can hear Ben wouldn't ... every Monday morning here on the big five fifty\nKatie are asked you in your ... today right I did yes a marathon shattered as TLC that calm how many crazy angry blues fans all their their multiplying and it's hard to blame them\nA they're a little frustrated and I don't I don't blame them it's just\nMan it's trying to put it into words how like it's just frustrating because it was right there and they at the stadium and the this remade roster and this energy the cardinals or the postseason you have this moment every\nWhole cities yourself soul cities ready to go nuts for blues hockey and they came out and\nThey laid the dead in the opener elated or with a chance to remake the opener you go on this road trip and he landed at at the end of the road trip and I are coming home for seven straight home games and it's like okay now they're going to get to go in and it's like are they really I mean and I get it and I'm trying to be patient because\nA lot of new players it takes time for chemistry to build understand these things\nBut you know when you do is sounding alarms like we don't care enough we need to have a we ... we need to you know stop playing you know little kid hockey we need to you know he's sounding big alarms basically calling his team out for effort and energy and all of the things that should not be\nYou know a problem or you know traced back to having new players on the team it's a little alarming\nAnd the way they're losing his little alarming I can find positives and the the special teams I mean I think they're ... a lot better than last year as it should be when you have so many new faces\nFace off percentages outstanding um they're creating chances to finish more of them but there's there's reasons to be optimistic there\nBut then you look at this like the third periods in the blown leads in the defense and it's just it's tough it's just not good hockey right now\nYou you mentioned in one of the ... ... bonus to you all today dot com up to chat about you know ... being on the hot seat here already we've talked about that a lot of ... and you were very rightfully so brought up the connection you do in Doug Armstrong you know ...\nThis this can't end for your when less it's also Indian for army right and I don't think that should happen but one is\nI think tied to the other end in ... which is why I think he always going to get a pretty long leash here when it's all said and done but it's it's just very interesting to me because if this continues to go sideways [noise] um I think Armstrong's just as much to blame right\nYeah yeah I mean army was army was this was his master plan let me start there because if you talk about that the pressure of being on you know let's acknowledge what we're really talking about\nArmy picked yo as the next coach brought him in to be the ... the public coaching waiting under can Hitchcock let other coaching candidates come and go with sticking with his original plan of having ... will be the guy last season army made it clear that he was not going to make kind of moves that beat this team of postseason team\nHe was looking forward to this season and beyond he thought this would be the start of a you know the longer excess will run with myself\nTo blame for not making the posting last last year if you'd like but also look at the moves that were not made\nThat I think that's fair so now to say that you do is you know if they're not out of this funk by Thanksgiving and you're always gonna be fired then all of a sudden you know it's all new to me it's like\nIt's you're in a given that much time with a team that you've declared to be a postseason team that's all the chance that he gets to figure it out and this was the guy that you hire to make coaches waiting let other guys come and go yeah that was confidence him to do all that but not enough confidence in him to go past Thanksgiving to to figure this out\nThat seems a little premature to me and it's going to be I think it'd be hard for me to sit there and make a convincing case that that this was on the show but also acknowledge that sometimes that's not what has happened in hockey\nYou know sometimes in hockey where coaches or change like we change ... doubt it's not this is this guy's fault it's hey this is really the only thing we can change army is not going to fire himself he's also\nHey this is really the only thing we can change army is not going to fire himself he's also has not\nKind of put himself is not where you didn't have much room to to tweak with the roster he's up against the cap this is pretty much the team they are going to happy hour is not going to change so what can you change if you have to get into the post season this year in ... feels like that and this team needs to be in the post season this year they can't go through another postseason\nMiss so you have to get there at some point you're up you're back into a corner where you just have to start changing whatever you can change in and for this roster and its limitations\nLike the coach is probably the easiest thing to change he read or write a but it's your like you said it it would be a scapegoating ... it would let's call it what it is who shares the thing that happens a lot in the sports\nSo it wouldn't be that unheard of you're not trying to play both sides of the ... I don't think it's on yell but I also if it gets to that point where they're playing like this and it is Thanksgiving and you're you're looking at playing yourself out of it before it even the you know the meat of the season\nThan you'd probably have to start pulling levers and right now there's really only one lover that makes sense to pull financially and in terms of you know roster flexibility wise you can't go mix up this whole team and go get a bunch of new players you did that this off season\nSo to me it's the choices are limited well\n... ... I'm going to touch on that let's say that seven game homes than let's say two and five\nWhat I mean this this to me is really really critical I I think it's spelled out a lot of what ultimately direction\nThis thing goes over the next two three weeks with with this home stating what again if you have that type of\nHome stand\nWhat what what what are they do I mean and ... and I'll answer that question with another question\nDark Armstrong how can he fire\nMike yo and and and put in\nSome sort of again a ... a ... again we hear all the time you know this team needs a new voice you just said it two months ago my kills the long term answer for it the the foundation of this franchise into much you're going to decide when we got to change this right now because\nHe's not the voice for the future he's not the voice for right now\nAnd then ultimately who's\n... what can you do you have you don't you don't have any body it they didn't want to get Ken Hitchcock back out of retirement to come over here\n\nWell it would be the answer here it'd be a backtracking of it would be a big big proportions words don't matter results do when we're change aren't you in on the fly\nBut I think you also have to put it in context of the league\nI mean this is what hockey what they do I'm usually there is there's not really again it's it's not so much that that's the answer it's at [laughter] all the other boxes are checked\nAnd it's like okay we have to do something or maybe let's do that and I don't I don't think army wants to do this I don't think he I don't think I think he I think his number one was that this team gets at rolling I don't think there's any\nBefore you do but I think yo knows as well as anybody that in hockey if your team books to be down to heading down the point of no return the first the first and easiest place to go as a coach I I just think you\nGuys are going to be on him I mean I don't eat it should be on ... for change low who's not playing well enough to to be the captain right now it should be ... gallon is actually played pretty well but his defenders aren't helping out much Jay bow Mr looks like\nYou know looks like the Ninety five year old man out there which is to be on it should be on vitamin tears think oh\nI Know that it's like blasphemy to call out ... in this town and everybody gets their feelings hurt and everybody goes oh my God don't criticize him what if he wants to leave leave us high and dry he's got two goals than I can see that more than two points in one game this season more than two points one game he's mine is six for the year I get a new players\nIn all this stuff it takes time to build chemistry buddy you're the assistant captain dude you got to got to lead the way you're going to lead by example go scores some goals

is ... response at all I'm saying the fan base in rent to sell the anybody who expects more for lead richer cinco\nAnd says it is immediately going to result in him saying I'm leaving the nest and never turned and leaving in the middle of the night\nI've never has there ever been I mean honest to God has there been star he's a star player right we're good on that he is the star the blue songs

think pools probably was close no ... well ... in in terms of there was this belief that there was only certain days of the week where you'd be able to talk to\nYou know no no no no I'm not talking about media was I'm Talking about fans getting upset by lack of performance was oceans expectation wash okay has there been a ... or ... cardinals or blue I'm not sure how the media handles and got you I'm Talking about has there been a star player cardinals or blues who fans have been more willing to let\nYou know ditch them performance or not playing big in big moments or more overall disappointing seasons slide more than fled ...\nIt's it really and we have to go pretty far back to thinking the rams and I can't really think of any card bills that that would get you know again\nUsually when your arm layer seems to not be performing up to potential people get mad they want to see more well\nI think they signed Matt Holliday the next day he went out and grounded out and they were already ready to trade them so that's\nChanged for ... years [laughter] I don't know what is what's in it you know I don't get it or is it because it's like they've had some good players have left before the all of a sudden you just can't hardly ... like it must be talked about a goody as it doesn't get like the fans are just the fans will not when you say that there should be better\nAnd here's the deal there I Can't think of any blew that got up and do a lot of shape because they were criticizing decided to leave town bought the list of St Louis blues really good hall of fame St Louis blues that have left the\nFranchise an email we won a Stanley Cup elsewhere ... I think that\nIs the root of the issue there I mean people if God had billionaires fads\nRoot of the issue there\nI mean people I've got ... million is the ads are deathly afraid\nWho is sitting next to ... it ... its terrorists and go the next star\nTo win one she decides to up and leave town is he going to go somewhere and immediately when a Stanley Cup with a team that's not the St Louis blues I had because you I I think you're absolutely right but I think that's I think that's the root of the issue\nI guess I get it to some degree but men say Beau Mr can only take so many lashes at some point you have to look at some other guys on the team firmly the ones who are supposed to be the best players on the team\nTrenches was taking a good deal of criticism and rightfully\nSo yes in in in in Ninety One never gets any ever\nShe is a he is above the fray as they say right he's a he's basically immune to it and what what here's the deal but I I don't see a lot of ... you're talking about we talking about media I don't see a lot of media criticizing nursing go either\nOther than you know whenever whenever it if it does happen it is God Bless your email inbox and then the next morning I I wrote when was it a couple of years ago when he did when he wasn't going to talk on the final day of practice terrified the locker clean out day\nAnd there was all this chatter about is he may be looking at about going overseas as happy as he ... he didn't he blew it off\nIt wasn't the Kentucky's foundation was cracked indoors water the sewage spouting through the basement okay so we're not exactly talking about the same situations I mean ... berry came over\nVery very inherited a team that he was already a part of that one a lot of games the very recent past under griping so to say that he is the mark stoops of Missouri is a little bit misleading and I think it's pretty disrespectful not a lot of ways to gaping hole in the program they left behind\nAnd that's my that's behind to NFL players by the way I'll say that\nMark stoops you know he's a good example and Barry should point them and say look what happens when you get when you know you have the right guy and you give them enough time look what can happen but just don't try telling me that that that ... that he had a worse situation or is the kind of situation the ... at a Kentucky when he got it that's not true\nI mean I think brings up a valid point but what ... what else I see is interesting is that it's clear again on prompted that was part of his opening statement today uh it's it's pretty clear ban that Barry is aware of the talk that is out there of\nCourse he is I mean and it's not like I mean last year to year people what what do they keep talking about hot tea well because it's it is significant enough that the coach is bringing up his points unmitigated ... prompted you I'm In the in the opening of his press conference so to tell me that it's not as of discussion\nThat doesn't make sense to me when the coaches going out of his way to say hey I'm going to take a stance here and try to give you guys have been formation that I Hope you use then it shows you exactly what's going on I mean let's all the adults and realize what's happening here no one has said Missouri season's over no one has said that it could end up being a very good season\nIf anything we know the various teams tend to finish stronger than they start this could be ... still be this could still be a great season from a zoo now could reach the expectations that we thought it could be maybe not I mean maybe not but it can still be a very good season\nYou know he knows that but he's also worried that if if they don't if they don't\nGet it rolling here in the second half that can be looked at as hey if you couldn't do it this team when can you do it and that conversation is is going to keep happening if if they lose games so he's trying to get out on the right side of it I don't blame him for it but you also were allowed to factor in the context it's really there too\nAnd I ... well it it's it's fair to a you know Kentucky is forever will be\nIt is that whereas you see a school it's up basketball school you cannot tell me any different I understand football is a big moneymaker and everywhere else but there is an exception in Lexington, Kentucky it's always a basketball school and\nI think ... and this is to me a valid conversation to have if\nBecause most Xu ... since they got to the FCC you could say was it was ahead of Kentucky there ahead of Vanderbilt and they're chasing schools like Tennessee wanting to be on the same level of tendency Florida and Georgia and for Thirteen and fourteen was you could say that now\nYou can ask the question has Kentucky pass them is Dubai\nAnd I think because I I Do have a problem with with this constant well you know Barry has been beaten ranked team and drew can't do it against the winning team this that and the other you're playing the FCC you're playing the lead schools quite frankly are always going to be better than ... a big picture Georgia\nOr Alabama offer all these ... it's just a fact of life\nWhat a school that I don't think there should be acceptance that they that they're better than ... Kentucky that's got to be a school year and year out you can put yourself up on the ledger and say we're better than Kentucky and they make\nYou can put yourself up on the ledger and say we're better than Kentucky and they may have more wins then was do by the end of the urban but if you can beat Kentucky on Saturday at least you can say hey we got him and we got him in a year where they're having their best season\nAnd I think that would mean I I really do I think this game means a lot on a lot of different levels and not the least of which\nIs hey head to head we beat these guys\nOn the beat them since two thousand years or so we'll be right so I Would argue that head to head they've been worst team since then um\nYou know I don't know I think this is a really fascinating game for no reason to doubt one was you fans will never you know if they do beat Kentucky ... it's pretty big when did he do it for this team but I don't feel like they'll get enough credit if they do it\nBecause it's going to fall back on ... Kentucky well they're they're they're they're almost to talk to him in the country at this point I'm so in other didn't look good against Vanderbilt last week there's still one good teams find ways to win games in a play well in\nUm you know their their quarterback situation's a little sketchy right now but they have a one of the nation's best defense is one of the nation's best running backs\nAnd so it's kind of a it's a it's a no win but in some ways it's it's it's a bit of a trap because if you beat him he probably you know don't get the respect you there when did you lose to mold and you lost a Kentucky and even though this is the best Kentucky team that Missouri has seen since it since it entered the SEC and it's really not it's really not close I was really stunned\nI'm not usually stunned by line I was stunned by this line that Missouri's favored by but I think it was six maybe up to seven points in this gap thought it was going to be a pickle myself that I can I ducked Kentucky you'd be favored I don't know how you could look at the team's Kentucky's beaten and how unexpected\nMissouri will win this game that I think Missouri could win but I don't know how Vegas is the one that one\nWell here's the deal and I've seen I saw power rankings before the bam a game though the debate is power ... that they use to determine their line they don't use the the top twenty five they don't use swell staggering comes into play for some of their stuff\nBut the but they've got a way of looking at things that the general public does not and they hadn't a zoo in their top twenty five up until\nThe last to Alabama um and and they've gotten a zoo in Kentucky pretty closely punched together in their rankings which I can see why\nThey would I Would see it more I I Would think more three or four ... who favored then in that in that situation but\nUm it tells me a lot and it tells me that people\nGuys you know the wise guys if you will in Vegas\nThey seem was with a ton of Taliban and I think that's where a lot of this kind of comes back to a ... you know the criticism that Barry get seemingly on on a weekly basis he's got players and he's got young players that are good I I did a talent wise it's there can you then\nGet this team over the hump and and get what again it it's Kentucky but to me this would be a marquee when on a on a lot of different levels like I said not the least of which is that you can you can go out and recruit and say hey we're better than Kentucky because\nWe just beat him and I and I think that's a team you've always got to at least perception wise feel like you're better than\nYou know I don't think I don't think it's Kentucky I think that I think this team has patch has said that this season I think this is the game very old and he's saying is I don't know if that could be the right beetle ranked team that's the elephant in the room here and uh when like that no matter who it comes against or something that you can say hey\nWe had some ups and downs but here's this here's a tangible sign of progress\nI don't it's hard for me to sit here and say I feel like Kentucky's a signature when\nBut it's the closest thing that Barry what have senator your areas have since he got the job and those kind of winds\nAre the ones that an FCC coach has to have in order to convince his bosses and his fans that if the tide is turning those are the kind of wins that you rise up and smack somebody that's favored or that is is rank tire and you can point to your athletic director say look\nLook at what we're doing here this is this is a foot hold that is what this game's about on Saturday\n... sports columnist from the St Louis Post Dispatch offered and we see more ... coming up with a kickoff confidential seven it's all mine\nFriday night here in the big five fifty when we come back you know I thought that I was supposed to be that where they released the for the first time the college football playoff rankings they did not so maybe it let's do our own college football playoff rankings on the other side of this break may as well really let down by that tonight I was looking forward to it and we got to do that and the other side of a break it's two two of the world series by the way\nOut in Boston this is the big sports show all the big five fifty K.

ah\nCouldn't be more excited about the the your head\nAnd it's coming off of\nAll I Want to say the final four but it's more appropriate to coming off\nAnother final\nFour the valley and you know what do you you know ... or their tangible things that you notice in the office that are that are that are benefits from getting to the final four that you guys are able to kind of ... to the months after it happens\nI think up some of it is is a morale and we took almost everyone who could go to to ah San Antonio and that's all that was a great\nRewards for their hard work [noise] um there's just a new sense of energy we've got a revised and renewed partnership with Larry field sports\nUm [noise] you know I think what happens with loyal they're going to the final four yeah it's eight and a half million dollars over six years which is you know that doesn't change the game for anyone that helps but I think it gives hope to all of our programs that they can be next maybe not final four\nLevel that they can certainly be championship caliber and\nAre good coaches which say they've all done we're happy with the coaching group that we have I think we can see a a renewal of the kind of years that we've had and we've had two or three teams and maybe four in the tournament\nAnd said maybe this year I as we talk to coaches and you and I spoke earlier when you talk about the ... the experience of players coming back\nPluses you already pointed out Griffith terrific coaches\nAnd while it will be a gauntlet playing in the league league schedule will be I mean guys are going to be killing each other every night which is great for fans\nBut the um renewed sense of what needs to be done in non conference to setting yourself up I think I don't want to jinx it but I think you could [noise]\nI think the valley could be back with more than two multiple multiple teams\nSo I'd like to see that and you know it was it was great in years when we knew going into the tournament week that we were going to get more than one that that's that's certainly our our primary goal going into every years to get multiple men's and women's basketball teams in the tournament so\nAnd as you said earlier Bob we would be greater St Louis you play more of our teams in the regular season I Would\nLove it I think that it's in and we forgot which could we talk to many coaches is Barry Barry talking to bury about the region and I and I was not pandering to him and I'm not to you but between\nYou know Barry yourself and folks in St Louis you in the way college basketball has grown in the region over the last Thirty years and the interest um\nAnd and you see that in the Taliban coming out that there's so much St Louis but in in this region [noise] um I think the contributions made by this league are far\nClear intangible and um I I think it continues to help the sport thank\nYou for that and I and I'll say this one\nUm I I think it continues to help the sports thank you for that and I and I'll say this what's happening at St Louis you they're going to be really good this year Travis Ford is taken that that program to to new levels that helps us I think and there'll be another function here with the coaches from Illinois Missouri here that you may see on the twenty fourth [noise]\nUm and the last time they had one of these was at a YMCA and north north St Louis and the question came from the audience shouldn't be ... to ... should you be playing St Louis university would that makes all the sense in the world that is a rivalry that should happen\nTo a question about it a Doug Elgin is argue as the commissioner of the Missouri Valley conference\nDoug is we always talk about and remembers talked about it a lot today scheduling and getting those numbers right the formulas write\nIt's going to be a little different this year um I guess we're not referring to the RPI anymore there there are obviously formulas in place but what what what are you guys going to be focused on an ... and again and kind of\nEducate us a little bit on some of the numbers we'll be talking about on the air um again a little different than maybe we've done in years past\nThere there's a new metric catch a composite metric and the Google Cloud professional services as they [noise]\nGod I don't know what I mean that is where this came from is it that the formula isn't known\nHow they are blending in offensive and defensive efficiencies scoring margin differential and a victory with a cap on\nYou and what is what is considered in this one is ten points you don't want coaches wrong running up the score to a unnecessarily when the game's outcome is in in ... in doubt [noise] um [noise] I don't think it's going to be a whole lot different I think you're going to still see the Kentucky said rank ahead of\nTeams that are well below them that that's not going to change much [noise] um [noise] it it's going to it's going to have a new sense of interest in the way that\nPolls come out every week or every day they'll come out every day I'm sure as they are I did um but I still think my spine formulas very simple you got a schedule better teams and be some of 'em you've got to beat tournament teams if you want to be considered ...\nIs the formula derived from the the principles of Ken Pomeroy these numbers with you mentioned off into the defense of food an inch and see I think it can ... can palm first uh is it going to come from from his formula\nI think there there are three video analytic gurus that that were brought in to a summit actually more than that you had Pomeroy you had just staggering and you had Kevin Powell goes on the staff at Michigan State okay who is has his own KP eyes have another one of these\nAh you're addictive rankings the predicted rankings are not based on only on results\nThey are was based on winning or losing\nAnd it was weighted differently if you were home right rich or on the road [noise] this is different because it brings into effect a lot of other factors\nI think all those guys separately are terrific together and now I'm going to get my tinfoil hat on here by that anytime we have a secret formula concerns me\nI I don't think it's secret and I had a sister said I Can't understand [laughter]\nWell that and you know I I talked to somebody who was inside that process and he said it's not\nOf course she was presented the award or during the twenty Thirteen World Series at the cardinals just so happened to be planning at the time against\nUh who else about the uh with the Boston Red Sox back there and twenty Thirteen so a big day for the cardinals again to reiterate you got your Molina the twenty Eighteen Roberto Clementi award recipient\nLuis you're in contact with them all in the family so maybe we'll hear a firm ... before this week is out here on the big five fifty ...\nAnd I and this is from the cardinals may have seen and that's just to put in perspective how it was and how how how all leaning you when when he was in Puerto Rico\nPerspective how it was and how how how all leaning you when when he was in Puerto Rico and again he wasn't very ... two days after the season ended last year\nIt there's a ... there's a quote from colonel magazine are they start at five AM and went to midnight we will go go from house to house handing out bad backs of food and water that from your self\nThat's just amazing and\nI'm emotional Rene that's because the ... like I never wished as to what happened in Puerto Rico do my worst enemy this by that because it's not only no power no food no potable water\nFor months four months and months and it's also no sex sells signal for a couple of days because everything's wiped out your\nYour and he was on the ground almost immediately and like you said figuring out ways to help and and basically walking up to the start of this past season up until that point ... was was there you know lending a helping hand and more\nUh throughout the those several weeks and months and you can still don't or you can still help we just go to the foundation for dot com stash donate the foundation for dot com slash donated his daddy's foundation type and Google foundation for in number four hours out all the um or for a number for you yes\nExcellent Luis great work buddy a it's a great day for the cardinals great day for ... for for Puerto Rico yeah all the way around and as we continue on to score\nStickers beer [noise] watch if I have to stop it is gay two of the world series tonight between the\nDodgers and Red Sox two left these on the mound a hundred and ... and David Price head to head David Price since last time I probably his best\nStart ever it was just last start is best start ever in the postseason coming from a guy that follows up Chris sailing and Clinton curse on the greatest postseason pitching buried of all time\n... four plus sale went for\nAn end to eat or even close to being around to the end by the way the over under run total last night was seven and a half to obliterate of that but like the six or seven ...\nIf you thought low scoring run a low scoring pitching dual affair well think again and I kind of lean towards that being the case again tonight and I'll tell you why [noise] uh and and then not sure I'm not making money pick on this I I I Love so much being able to say hey\nI'm four and five and two right now if I make two or three more picks might be like free losses in a row so let's at least for the moment quit while we're ahead a and you know more picks coming once we get to blame dolphins [laughter] more picks coming by the time we get to a\nA college basketball season but\nAs a as these to block clubs get ready tonight for game too I think we could see much of the same especially with both lineups featuring a ton of really good right handed hitters [laughter] and um\nI just I my attitude all year long was never bet against the red Sox when they're facing a left handed pitcher and last night would have been that then I didn't make it official pick\nBut you know back in the back of my head I'm thinking it's it's ... how can you how can you go anywhere but Boston and but the red Sox here because\nThey are going up against that that caliber a pitching this this is going to work out Boston's way so let's take a look at the lineups for tonight for the home team Red Sox against rye you\nA monkey bats Andrew Ben attendee Steve Pearce he batch third against the south part JD Martinez ...\nAn ... Jackie Bradley junior and up behind the plate for the red Sox is Christian Vasquez so again they do have a few left these isn't there against rye you\nAnd\nThey will try there and by the way back to India last night going up against ... Shaw had four hits but three runs scored\nAnd he may not even be the front runner for the MVP because of the pinch hit home run by a word on unions came in a huge spot and ... when you and you should set homerun games over you know game is over for the Dodgers once again\nAnd that was sort of the creativity I I've I thought Cora Alex for\nA you know really shrewd move there instead of you know because you think it let's just step right ... well he had pneumonia is on the bench just in case for later in that game and and he paid shit Evers for New Years and it paid off in a big way for manager Dave Roberts he does go all left these against price\nBrian does your just to turn to David Freese Manny Machado Chris Taylor Mac camp kicking Hernandez you asked your ... and Boston Barnes one through nine [noise] All right hander is against the red Sox and I I\nSpoke to a Mr Jay Randolph today as we put together some of his promos for our Breeders' Cup handicapping seminar next week Jay and Doug ... will be on a week from friday to get you ready for the Breeders' Cup nothing has been nothing is better nothing will get you ready more\nFor the Breeders' Cup a than a J Randolph and dug neck when you're on the big five fifty but a J by the way through his at in the ring Red Sox inside I really like Boston tonight against those against right now you can make a case\nPrice against all those right hander ... is is gonna be right for the picking and in that last game begins Houston maybe a bit of an outlier\nWhether it's postseason or whether it's just recent recently Dave Price\nOr has not been that good and there are a lot of good writing ... mentioned there for the LA Dodgers and they'll get underway in just a little bit continuing\nAs we roll on here [noise] uh [noise]\n[noise] I'm a\nBig five fifty ... dress and a writer friday I kickoff countdown\nJim holder bend Fredrickson how Richards will join us we'll look at insights from up the Kentucky Wildcats will visit with the head coach Barry owed them\nAll on the way friday night but some things at the zoo is going to have to deal with if they're going to win against Kentucky we'll talk about this Friday but I I really think for him to do to get this and they got to prove\nGoing up against the good defensive team that they can win a low scoring close game it was a high scoring close game against Purdue\nLasting to be produced by the way they did it in West Lafayette\nBut I have to prove that they can win a low scoring close football game how do you do that well how 'bout six seen all of the\nPenalties all of the little mistakes and they were so much more talented at least match ups on Saturday ... often ... against the Memphis events and overwhelming win for the Missouri Tigers\nAnd even though they're little misty all those little mistakes they they didn't hurt because I Want to gain by what thirty two points bought bought up against Kentucky and that ... that has been excellent I I have a feeling was who's going to have to win a low scoring game\nTo do that you got to get rid of the penalties how do you fix a barrier them\nFor you look at the penalties are though we committed last week and then your show those to your guys uh\nThis week and then you show those\nThree are guys of number one is a staff we evaluated and critique them all [noise] what can we do better as coaches to make sure we don't commit those penalties and then if you have a penalty and practice then you're going to do the same thing on Saturday that that doesn't change so ah we've got a little bit of a\nOf awareness training that has gone into play for guys or commit penalties and hopefully it makes them aware not to do it again\nI get crazy looks sometimes I say ... really talented got really good players they're not a really good team yet Kentucky they they keep\nThey been a cohesive unit because their numbers don't overwhelm you and that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be great next year you better start recording better players or Kentucky but you know getting ready to walk out the door\nThere will be recruiting better players but like right now the coaching job ... says done in Lexington it's outstanding you should be easy easy coach of the year and you see see I don't hear anything about Nick Saban\nSay but it's got the best players in the world every single year you better be number one the country would that type of talent\nHas been the case and coach of the earth should go to coach that lifts his team up from projections and I look at these numbers I look at like Kentucky throws the football Kentucky should have maybe three or four wins right now instead what they've got six\nIt could be seven in one after Saturday and a legit
