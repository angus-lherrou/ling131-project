o'clock pre game six o'clock kick off here on the big five fifty right now\nWe welcome in our usual cast of characters mind it was burned and we see joined by Jim holder and sports columnist from the St Louis Post Dispatch ... gentlemen it feels like an especially leading up to the start of the show as we kinda\nCongregate in the bullpen if you will are a lot of off the comments that aren't meant for the air but I I just get a sense there is a lot of frustration\nAbout this football team actor again where the tigers I personally thought dominated and a lot of areas yeah come away with a loss against an undermanned South Carolina team\nWith a backup quarterback guys where where do you think the frustration level where should it be act right now from his new football\nWell I think you start with I think it's always productive to look at things that can be attributed to the big picture and that's what I tried to take out a loss like South Carolina you don't look at you know maybe one single play but you look at patterns or or issues that are going to could affect the team\nMoving forward and I think there are some legitimate concerns there you have some some ... some play calling questions\nAbout how Missouri was able to run the ball in the conditions with the rain why didn't they lean heavier on the run you have some again a pattern of kind of self inflicted mistakes too many to overcome um attribute that to the the third quarter of the slide that happened after a touchdown run was called back I don't necessarily think being\nA quarter of the slide that happened after a touchdown run was called back I don't necessarily think being out of bounds for my credit was a mistake probably should have been that close to the sideline but that's a tough a tough play Missouri did not respond\nOr responding negatively to me that's a that's a that's an issue um and then you also have to me but I notice more than anything it's just the\nThe lack of a game winning play especially on defense and I do lot can lead a touched on Dr he can rally a team did it but the defense fall season has not come up with the kind of place that when football games they don't come up with the big sec they can't\nPick off the big past they had a chance on that final drive to intercept the play that would have won the game it hit the mark say see in the hands and he couldn't come down to account for\n... from South Carolina that were dropped that could have turned into interceptions if two of those get picked off it's a completely different game so those are kind of the big picture issues that I think having a Z fans frustrated right now\nWe're you know vote for it I think I look more\nNot that I'm putting down with\nDefense of miss cues that were made or should that had been made or maybe they come out of the Columbia South Carolina with a W but I'm offensively again I'm not talking so much on special to be a huge although that go\nOff as simply the drop passes and the play's been Fred's are about guys making plays rather than you know I I just like you\nKnow we had the drop in the end zone Franklin I'm\nI don't know how many uh Alberto had again drops you know in an ... after eleven touchdown pass was a year ago I'm thinking I'm looking at eighty one a lot and and I'm thinking\nThat eighty one is going to make place for me all year long with the size speed and what you know what he had gone from last year that has been banned it it really has we'd touted\nThe weapon just drew lack had at his disposal at the start of the year from hall to Albert go to Jonathan Johnson to a young receiving corps that actually started really fast made some place early in the season\nBut as a whole and and obviously we can't really control halls injury but as a whole I see the playmate cruise through the air\nInterest and pass some level among the fan base you cannot donations from all these things factor into an athletic director there is important is important relationship going on here and it's important to point out Jim Cirque\nHe likes very old I'm finding it along they work together great in iron\nAnd when you're in athletics director at a football school which is every school in the Southeastern Conference every single school in the Southeastern Conference his\nFront door is always going to be football even Kentucky more so becoming football is that we're going to top basketball at but look at which makes big money and has the potential to make the most money it's always going to be football when you're in the SEC so jumpstart didn't renovate the\nMemorial stadium to become a basketball school he has been very\nPublic about his desire to be a top twenty five program in men's basketball and football right now you know there's still a chance for me to be a top twenty five program in football he thought the kind of guys going to make it in season change but he is looking to get to that goal and it is fair for him to say\nHere three that's no longer training wheels time with a quarterback that's going to go down as one of the best in school history if we can't do it then when can we do it so I think that's what that's the hell jumpstart 'cause watching to see them play out\nWho said it ... is your three there is no longer will they showed primary you're hearing here if the ... the progress is in in a win loss record you're in trouble that's the only thing that matters year three you can get away you're wanting to put it to me it's college football it's big time SEC college football and like you said\nStart didn't hire Barry so I think very knows as well there everybody else this is\nThis is make or break time but I Do think\nWhere you can point to progress we're getting the proper is this practice doesn't matter at the end of year but I Do think it's worth noting how the team has played\nA meeting of going toe to toe with the second ranked team in the country Georgia and I think you had a couple things go on the other way they honestly for a couple of bounces called the brakes on their way where they had a chance for the fourth quarter to maybe win that game again they needed breaks to go the way they didn't go there and they lost\nAnd obviously they should have won the south Carolina game again what could've should've doesn't matter at the end of the year their losses and that's going to ultimately break your back if you got a lot more of them but I Do think it's\nFair to point out these last two games and said\nThis team has played a well in in a lot of aspects invading games even while drew lock has not playing well\nWhat if drew lack suddenly starts to put things together the next couple of weeks what if he does it against Alabama I'm just throwing it out there at this team has looked good in certain areas while you're best players haven't played well and I think they still had a chance to win the game\nThat's true but I'll say this I don't care how good he may throw or whatever the case if he saw if he doesn't have the receivers or Brennan is going to make all to do a difference in the world\nIf he doesn't have the receivers of\nBritain is going to make all the do the difference in the world and and you're quite right yeah tomorrow night I mean I I can only imagine\nA you know with Alabama and and the challenges that they have into secondary\nAlthough you know people throw to get some people that run against the problem is they put all you know forty five or fifty up by half dot\nNo don't spoil my inside the numbers coming up with a couple segments Jimmy

week and I appreciate the\nTime you got to stir up the you know you'll Saturday obviously a I think you you you uh categorize it afterwards is a bizarre game where where where does that rank in terms of the strangest games you've been involved in coach\nAt the I mean you know the man and both teams have a plan or the you know the weather really I don't know where it was a strange and and uh you know the college for a while you're always going to have momentum swings and she says as a\nAs a game goes on and you know we all know different the other day we had we had a really momentum and they capture that back we battled and five a proud of our team for the way that they showed toughest and resolve and\nGive us a chance to win the game and you know they may down the stretch made more place and we didn't [noise] you know the things the fine line of for winning purchase is hard to do and\nUm but make no shoes we got to find ways to use non comes down to execute the red zone on both sides of the ball\nA comes down to the turnover margin and obviously you know when it's when it's crunch time [noise] you know we've got to do a good enough job coaching to to put her kitchen position to go make plays in the night they need to go execute so our team was was hurt my by the last one that we\nAsked so close to pull it off and on but also we look at it for three and two on on through five games we lost in the number two teams in the country ah last a very evenly matched contest out South Carolina or there's a lot of really that's all we feel like we can go play here down the stretch\nAnd we're going to need and every week to go get what we want by the end of the year\nTo know you won't say anything to discredit South Carolina but did you feel like you guys dominated on on a lot of facets of that game on Saturday [noise]\nGod I don't know if dominated I mean I think we controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides we rushed for over three hundred yards which is hard to do in any game much Leslie play\nA and then I run the transfer out most of the game there were ... you know there there were errors and other\nUm and other ways you know the red zone you find ways to come away touchdowns natural spring\nDefensively [noise] uh you know last drives obviously it's not anywhere close to winning football on getting them to go make a play with her checks that we needed to make\n'em me away some easy [noise] um [noise] you know things now the red zone there's there's there's still um now if you look for the entire course of the game there's a handful of plays and they all matter but there's a handful plays it really determine the outcome of the game and we didn't make enough of them on on on\nThe coaches easy for us on this end to ask about red zone conversion insert down conversion but but what are some of the Sixers you guys can work on throughout the course of the week in practice or to address those areas\nOr they want to match ups um foreign were on defense you know we we lost a couple of opportunities their land you know we always want to take away to slam the red zone and they were able to get inside of a couple of times it makes your margins their\nOptions speaking you know we got down to the reds number of times we we didn't convert or you know once on on a slant to Knoxville balls a little bit behind wants to Alberto had an opportunity wasn't able to complete the catch and then\nYou know an opportunity to lead Johnson Johnson out what's the space to Iran and and what and I can hurt on those three [noise]\nYou know in that situation you know that's that's a big swing appoints\nThe through continual work man determination and finding ways and I and also gain planning on getting our guys and opportunity was we've we've got\nI'm not sure that's accurate because this is a different Alabama team this sort of feels like the best teams in the big twelve years gone by that would just inundate you with us ... couldn't stop you know again\nNext David may which something up this weekend and suddenly you know they look like the Alabama of old and a snap I'm staying here that could very well happen but I'm looking at the numbers right now Alabama's played a pretty or inspiring scheduled to this point and teams have been able to move the football\nSomething fair to point out is that and I and and if this is your cat her argument I get it as Alabama's up Twenty one twenty thirty five points a lot of the time for the post office can do anything and that's fair but the raw numbers telling me this Alabama dispense brightened this ... could be had\nWell I just don't know to me it's like what's worse than would be down getting beat thirty to nothing or getting beat sixty to thirty like that that I'm asking legitimately because this Alabama team might not be able to beat ... thirty to zero but he can absolutely we must be sixty to third yes you're right you know it it is is\nWe're in the psychology of the game here a little bit but it is hard to\nKeep a team from scoring when you are when you're reading them by this much and beating them this easily as Alabama's offensively to what looks like the best college football quarterback\nIn a very long time he is the clear clear cut front runner prize meant Nick Saban has never had a quarter back like this he said good ones but he hasn't had one like this who can run as effective as an often says they are now\nIt's also worth pointing out that a lot of these yards a lot of these points are coming in second halves of games and Alabama's been taking guys off the field I mean they've been beating teams so thoroughly that they're pulling starter their their lab an essay pulling starters as if\nYou know their second string guys would start anywhere else I mean we're talking about uh Georgia level depth here I'm In Alabama is had it longer than George s so it's worth pointing out that they are ...\nThat it's all fair demolishing teams in the first half ... guys games over to the backup so they've taken guys off\nThe field before and you know first ranked run defense compared to Seventy first ranked run the sense is a pretty big drop and\nI again I Want that spirit to bring up like I said I think it's fair to bring up was Alabama isn't really playing but yet at their best opponent is Texas and in that game was forty five at twenty three Tuscaloosa or you know and it's like ... in Arkansas state and Ole Miss two couldn't stop\nYou know a ... a junior high team right now in Louisiana Lafayette Arkansas Arkansas scores thirty one and that was the game are just always in that game for about\nTwo and a half quarters and then Alabama really pulled away from Arkansas what the bunch of points on the field to the worst of all given it away left and right but they moved the ball\nOn Alabama guys I'm just saying has been you're right you're losing six thirty or thirty nothing what's worse but I think back to that FCC championship games do last Alabama few years ago down in Atlanta did you ever feel like me who was actually in that game even though the exactly right\nIf you feel like you you can move the ball and Alabama and even like let's say Alabama scores first fourteen points but it was who marched down and put seven on the board and moved to football\nSuddenly you feel like you've accomplished something when you go out there and you're picking up two yards on one Dr negative seven yards on the next drive I don't care what Alabama's put on the board you feel like you're defeated already\nAgain I I may choose to see what Alabama defense we see but so far this doesn't look like statements old school guy old school crew and the fact that they're banged up their legit lame duck that secondary sort\nThere's there's an opening where this is not the embarrassment and everybody's\nFor just why just one of his work is on the defense you focus on the ...\nThere's no opening and when you focus on the team as a whole there's no up and so I I hear what you're saying the defense is as porous doesn't Alabama defense is looking at a very long time but this often said better than in Alabama the officers looked\nVery long time factor I mean they claim to store every week to an end to\nAs to his throne what Eighteen touchdowns without a pick he is leading the nation is passing as pets or any us to sixty\nThree even he lives out now he's competing uh Seventy five percent of his past and then jailing hurts comes in [laughter] to to to dust up his resume tape for for whatever he transfers to you know after after the season I mean this is this is a business at all since\nThat I don't know that anybody is going to be able to keep up with them and they're gonna that's gonna be the only way to beat him as you're not doubt score and ... not just Missouri but how any any team that in the country is going to be able to do that this is referring\nTo Georgia game last year where they go down there to uh to Athens and I don't think Georgia was ready for that type of launch lot from from the tigers him I thought was who was in that game again two and a half quieter than than Georgia pulled away\nYou every ... every game is a different story fellas and we can't just you know Alabama does walk off the field and just pick up right where they left off against Arkansas last week every game is different and um I I think the fact that their defense at least at the moment doesn't look shut\nI think the fact that their defense at least at the moment doesn't look shut down I\n... at least for me to open the door to my second number to point to a point three yards per pass attempt a lot by the news a lot by the defense as one hundred ninth and the country so\nYeah Alabama's often looks really good the tigers decent not so much that you know kind of goes back to the point of your AC making that play late then in in gym\nMake make a play make a point when you have to end the secondary just happening\nSo Missouri tomorrow night maybe can shut down the tide Steve rushing attack which isn't the best\nIt may be that we've seen here in the Nick Saban era at the University of Alabama so the um the idea though that the tigers decent maybe can shut down that run game and keep\nYou there I don't think it was shut down while though I Love animals but at the zoo run the ball in Alabama's the question\nRight over the you know I I think that they they're not going to embarrass themselves okay but then again from may pass defensive standpoint you know you can't you can't play that the way that they have been playing in that secondary and\nUh it expects to be able to stay close no but the guy that is probably going to get that thirty five pound or stop in a few months\nJim older Ben

probably feel they can put some stuff on before they are very respectful of the Missouri off so what is the bar nights game for ...\nNobody is looking at the next weekend with kind of have a significant game because you know that's just the way it is\nGood was not that bad of a book by any stretch you don't know\nIt is a good was not that\nBad of a ball club by any stretch how'd you don't do what coach told him and his assistants might have learned after watching Arkansas who football against the cap on a weekend but go show up no one has to take English can easily or or for granted by any stretch\nThe lines of numbers which suggested Alabama's defense has been ... specially on the ground you have you seen that would be the case so far\nThe numbers are deceptive because a lot of those garbage numbers\nWere put up again you know third and fourth strengthened offenders who are in the ball game place in the day when McCain was out of hand you know coach said but it would go to the to the ...\nThat's not to say that the first team versus the some yard it's because they did that but a lot of those numbers came out the expense of the ah\nFellows who are further down the ...\nUh but you know it's a the ... the friends that that is very talented very very young and that's the big story line here it's the young on CSPAN [noise]\nBut I don't care who you are you're recruited by next shape and then you're playing at Alabama or for that matter anywhere she said you're good to\nHear good it's just a matter of getting the raft and getting fatter a sold out what the Alabama the fence story or send up off\nBefore well let's say ... Florida but somebody even point to the FCC championship game against Alabama if Georgia's realistically in the national championship hot guys they really need to some I I really thought\nLSU wasn't over its I they're better than I thought they were but I still thought they were overrated from being the top ten team\nI don't think they're a top ten team there more than a touchdown home dog to Georgia this Saturday how do you guys handicapped this I don't to be honest with you\nI don't think we've seen the real complete Georgia team yet and they're still ration teams by three touchdowns are more every week so this this came to me is very interesting\nI think that Kirby Smart and a staff were probably a little disappointed to see that to LSU a was a a was gonna was losing to Florida because he knows going to Baton Rouge on Saturday Night tomorrow night that uh\nThat the yellow shoot team is going to be ready for this challenge I Would agree I mean I I think certainly it's going to be the biggest challenge to date that uh uh Georgia has seen but\nI um I still kind of like Georgia to go in there and when I again I think it's a matter of that talent of that four and five star type talent that Missouri we'll see tomorrow Tuscaloosa\nYeah I think that the factor watching this one is that it's obviously a home game ... see that's a tough place to play\nAnd that fan base is is even though they lost to Florida they jacked up they're going to be lab that's a that's a hostile environment out the door to isn't used to that but it will be a good test for the bulldogs if ah if they're going to you know if they're going to win that clash\nAgainst Alabama and what we would think would be the SEC championship I like Georgia too but I think this could be this can be a classic that has the makings of it\nHow about Texas damage South Carolina fell as as other game Cox look to parlay their success against the tigers\nThey get the Aggies who stopped the Kentucky winning streak this past weekend they now go on the road died this team fascinates me in in a lot of different ways because I I think\nThat might have been assigned a jumbo Fisher has this thing really training in the right direction and I think the first indicator of that was how they almost be clumps and back and we too I like to see an empty and a lot\nTo out will bust ship pose disappointed I'm sure to see the fact that to a A N am maybe is in that and getting building some strength\nOften supposedly an defensively now you know on the route of South Carolina hey that places and impossible that wasn't they didn't even fill it for the Missouri game for the mayor Scott\nSo horror the rain and light but I wasn't in the beginning what the twenty percent per head huh because there was an eighty there was an eighty percent chance that it wasn't going to rain right\nThere you go so I mean you know uh but they they did not fill us to get a hearing Mike and I'm oh we're talking about the fact that there were empty seats but anyway I I actually I like Anna\n... yeah I think and then once I came I think I think you're starting to see the new to the new elite coaches at new school starting to get their footing than Mullin is an example of that and jumble fish are starting to get the same thing he's starting to put it together as teams starting to buy in you're starting to see the results of that\n'cause I don't think South Carolina's very good team\nUm and I don't know the families back you know\nAnd I don't think South Carolina's very good team\nUm and I don't know if that leads back you know they've got a backup who was good enough to tread Missouri but I don't know that it's good enough he beat them I think South Carolina play to a more greedy\nI'm must win style against ... but I didn't see anything that South Carolina Tina thought oh yeah this is this is a better team than we thought going in I think it's I think that's a win for them\nTo lines that um is it there are that piqued my interest\nFlorida at Vanderbilt Vanderbilt only it's the the line is Florida favored by seven even though it's a national I think that number which kind of ... and how about Tennessee at Auburn that's that line started Auburn minus Eighteen minutes move now it's Auburn mine is Fifteen and a half I find that a\nLittle bit curious I Know that's a tendency to Vanderbilt team you don't buy too much into right now but I'll take\nNeither of those um I think I think Florida's super dangerous I Would expect them to take care of business and uh I don't know Auburn is\n... I I just think they're going to crush Tennessee I don't think it'll be that close to call but I haven't really done anything from Tennessee that suggests\nThat are that they're moving in the right direction as hope as quickly as they hope to under pressure now he took over a bad situation he might get turned around but he's not Mullen and you're not going to see the ... like results in your one\nI just thought that that line was curious why it moved in Tennessee's favor little bit it just it it it caught my eye and I'm curious\nAbout the lines usually no I mean we've seen that with me on the line moves on was do they get to know something that we know something was curious like maybe the Emanuel hall injury\nRight is it Michael Michael going to have any impact on up to the

American this year and from Memphis this is probably the biggest game so it it next week it's homecoming but that's a dangerous game for Missouri\n... depending on how they gain goes ... winner last I I'm not sure what what\nCould have a bigger effect next week but you talk about look ahead and you talk about coming down after a big win that's one to watch and see how Memphis plays against central Florida who's often right now it's sort of rivaling arrival you know how good Alabama's often says\nWell of who've been interesting to watch for a few reasons one UCS Frank tenth and the country so if it Memphis balls out against UCF then that's bad news from us you know what I mean the ... to\nMemphis just meet the bricks often ... by the same amount that Missouri did last year so that's another

UCSB is\nJosh ... guess what most of the place that Missouri is still running can found that so I'm telling you that the plays the off chance that Memphis has been preparing for against UCF is not going to be all that different against the ... from the office that they're gonna be playing the week after that's going to help\n... again like China to option teams in a row the second time you're going to be better around because you practice ... okay another thing to look at is who what game was UCF closest to losing to last year\nThey have the undefeated season that launched Scott process or the brass got to know the team that nearly beat him it was meant as Memphis there's a bit of a rivalry there so there's a decent chance I think the Memphis gives them a tough game Memphis is either one of those things that can just not show up or they can show up and beat you they're all over the place this year\nBut we're really weird last a two lane yeah weeks but then they came out and crush you kind of you can find a good team was gay straight crush them so I think this is a dangerous dangerous game from ...\nI'm right with you and this can tell us a lot in the Big Ten Saturday Night
