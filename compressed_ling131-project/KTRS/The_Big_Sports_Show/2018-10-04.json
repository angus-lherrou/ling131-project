Jake Allen's Latimer chair sake oh doesn't talk or\nEvery day he was holding court about what twenty five minutes with Doug Armstrong about twenty minutes with a Mike yo and lots of media more media than than uh probably saw in the last week combined out there but baseball season over hockey season here and that uh\nThe preseason went by in a flash of brand new year to it seemed like I uh just uh\nLike ten minutes ago I was getting a camper ready to uh to to go up to Trevor city for the prospects tournament and rush there goes the uh the pre season and nothing like a jumping into the deep water the Winnipeg Jets coming into town\nThere here and they're one of the best teams in the west you know listen to the dark Armstrong today talk a little bit about that you know there was this time it did not that long ago where it was like black hawks blues stars some some combination of those three\nAnd now suddenly it's when a pig and it's ...\nIt is a whole new era and it's everybody else and the and the blues trying to get to a a to that level I heard you guys talking on on the drive a out here to Westport from ah the post dispatch offices in downtown St Louis and uh\nYou know talking about uh all the turnover I looked through last year's season opening roster for the first game at Pittsburgh it was also a believer in the same date I Believe it was October fourth\nAnyway that roster\nThe what would it be the Eighteen that played are Nineteen if you count the backup goalie that were dressed for that game compared to what will be on the ice\nTomorrow night against the jets seven player's stats it out of Nineteen only seven players out of the Nineteen that open against Pittsburgh will be on the ice and now\nYes can I have no need for you asking if they if they didn't know suspension was coming as you know twenty games he got a point where it came down to like this afternoon twenty games yeah and about one point to six million a dollars of law Sal and\nDeservedly still know what kind of garbage is that in the pre season in a meeting whiskey\nLast game of the pre season second uh you know is on course not looking I Know some of the Washington Capitol says while he had his head down you have to keep his head that he had his head down because he was shooting the puck I'd never seen anybody looking up to the sky and shooting a\nIt's not like he was skating with his head down and then he got hit Blind Side he didn't see it coming Armstrong said he's got a concussion he's got a a a shoulder problem an injury after that and you ... I don't know if you saw him in the locker room I saw him a an apple assist faces all is all jacked up it's all it's all that stuff\nSo the the asking move it uh it comes down and and you mentioned Armstrong you hear some of those descriptions of of what happened there and again wind up in Washington\nThe end of last year Dimitri asked uh if if possible for a trade\nOr he felt that his career was stagnating and and I understood that and so at that at the draft I informed all the teams that he was looking for a new opportunity that didn't transpire training camp by\nReconfirmed with all the managers that he was looking for different opportunity and uh [noise] I didn't get any calls and then ah [noise]\nSo we you know part of it too is when you when you\nYou you look at things a little bit differently when people don't want to be around\nAnd I was going to be comfortable uh if you are cleared waivers being part of our organization I might have been something that could have sparked him with us but I'm happy for him it gets to Washington\nA it's a little bit ironic the Washington claim them because they're going to play with spending so we actually lose two players in that transaction we lose we move Sundquist man we lose you asking but I you know I I Wish you ask me nothing but the best he's been a good soldier Yuri's he's um [noise]\nIt's been it's been a difficult time because he he wanted more and we couldn't give them more and and I will be as well as some Washington\nAnd OJT you didn't start on the beat a win win the asking me first started popping up I mean he's been around and and expectations for him had been around for some you know four or five years and it is kinda disappointing to see that and without him really contributing but if there wasn't a spot for him I admire\nThat they were able to to ah\nTo let him go and and\nAnd for him to find something else or\nThey're in Washington and maybe that doesn't happen if ah it it doesn't if there isn't any of the down\nThat was a looming in you know asking when I talk to them a earlier in camp he mentioned that you know you know and it is the problem with him as men that office and he said you know when you're only playing ten minutes on the fourth line it's hard to Iraq\nAnd that office and he said you know when you're only playing ten minutes on the fourth line it's hard to ... points but especially when they made all these offseason moves is there were there wasn't going to be an opening for him to play even on the third lie\nSo we mentioned all of the employers all of the new additions\nChemistry it's gotta be something that uh is going to be\nWorth watching an army talked to Santa Newt again about putting all of these new pieces together\nI think going to Annapolis was very big for us because in training camp [noise]\nIf you don't spend any time on the road are exhibition games we leave at two o'clock land at three thirty home by midnight\nAnd so you're really not sure what the players are during one of the rink are they what are they spending a lot of time together but in Annapolis we knew what they were even we knew they were together and all the early returns or this this has a chance to be very close group is they say those things but\nReally what brings a team really close together is winning and and you know if we win will be close and and\nUh I think a lot of that goes to to uh [noise] I Know the veterans most dean interesting quote\nTook a lot of control of that this year they understood that that it was going to be a first impression on those guys are going to be very big and and I think they made a good first impression\nOrganization it's it's not going to be you know it it may not happen right away J. T. but how would this team comes together again this this is a really it feels like a brand new core again a guy's like Petro in in ... they've been around the block a few times but this this\nFeels like a whole new era with all of the new pieces and and trying to fit them altogether isn't always easy but I think army set of winning I guess we'll we'll solve a lot of those issues but does the team to come together first before that when he can happen\nYeah they they have to get to know each other and and to a I think a rally pointed out to earlier in the in in camp but you know you've got to know where does a guy like puck what are the fees favorite areas on the ice can I depend on him for this for that\nAnd that takes a while to work out but again it's also just getting to know these people\nUh as as people imagine a a reading we see you got a big network job and you show up and you don't know any body are maybe you know a couple of the people and it it takes a while to to uh to to to to get to know these guys and as I mentioned at the top of the show\nAre only seven players on opening night\nIn two thousand Eighteen or in the middle line up on opening night on a two thousand Seventeen so you know I had a one fan it may make kind of get ... look at the the uh uh the Vegas Golden knights they threw a whole team together but it was a little different they're all coming in on the ground floor\nYou know it's not like at some players that news the system some players that didn't they all are people that were\nDiscarded by other teams and so they had a a bond right there a chip on their shoulders were the misfits remember that's what the players call themselves throughout the season and the other thing what happened was really count on some miracle in sports so I you're you're not going to see an expansion team even with the way the rules are\nCome in and do what they did for probably for a long long time so he had all these issues I think an apple is really helped\nBecause they had some structure to their days I mean they they practice or a couple of days but there there there was no practice on Monday they toward uh\nUh the Naval Academy had had lunch with a with a ... ... they had a lot of time and into their cells to to go out to dinner and maybe get a beverage or two and a I think it was all good you know in in a in that party you know he mentioned Petro\nChair cinco in Steen Armstrong Doug our ... we should mention that same group of captains they share Petro the captain Steen and tear shaker all the ... are the alternate at all I get\nA lot of that a lot of the previous core around but a whole lot of new faces\nTo try and blend in here with this twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen St Louis blues squad that ship Thomas I'm Britain we see the big blue show on the eve of the open or here in St Louis blues in Winnipeg Jets tomorrow night we have\nTo preview the defense you previewed the forwards last week and the defense is a a little thin right now let's hear from J.

Gulf geek on Twitter and ...\nSTO golf geek on Twitter and Jay you got to be honest\nWe were so worn out after that ... that we took from the European team we decided to stay on the other day and old Perry\nWell I Hope you and our executive district Janet getting doing joy Paris I Know if you've are rooted in for the Americans are after friday morning there wasn't a lot of rooting that do are a lot of excitement or to talk about it break it down but Bobby I guess we start with the captain's\nYeah I think we should and uh let's listen to what a captain Jim fewer a cat they say some of it is really confusing to me but let's give a listen\nWe're going to get a second guest and we're going to get a question ... earlier this team as a captain the brunt of it's going to be on my plate and I accepted that when I took this world\nWe came over here and played our practice rounds of prep for this golf course when I said\nOver and over and over again I have every confidence in these twelve players that you could we have a great team I Would take 'em right back into another article played all over again if I could obviously this our tastes in her mouth to come over here now for twenty seven years and the other one on foreign soil that's the goal\nWe want to be successful in this event and we want a girl we want to get better here in Europe will be the only four years from now\nYou know and I are\nSomewhere I think I read that the press to said that he would take those same troops\nThat that there is something let's say something has to change the guy that ended up playing the best of the bunch was that guy that's known for playing while on top of golf courses and that sweating censor two or three years ago\nYou wouldn't have even been on a Ryder Cup team so it it says a lot about the fact that the guy who was your back performer and left out of a ... was was that what we're talking about a team that has\nDustin Johnson Justice Thomas Georgia's beat Tiger Woods Phil Mickelson I mean on and on and on it it's really hard to imagine\nWell you know back in Nineteen Seventy seven Jack Nicklaus himself went to the powers to be because the U.S was winning on a regular basis\nOr interest was not or whether it should be for a ride a cup he suggests that all of Europe or be included in the team I'm thinking maybe Thomas beyond that few months to a issue the ultimate needle and I don't think\nHe's as any interested in doing that but he should call the PGA every American say one of your news Canadian players are in junction with us to to make it more competitive\nHow this goes south of the border to Mexico to do it wasn't like North America I mean it we know that the talent\nIs there I mean we we we we see this week the week on the PGA Tour\nAnd that's why they were all left with this disappointment and it's it's it's only when you watch the demeanor of the two teams and the way they react on the golf course ... just a you know somebody said to me well what about the trap all\nThese guys are accustomed to travel they had a couple of days to get their bearings I mean they're already over there on Monday the opiate up real until friday\nThat there is no skills I mean ... you got work and uh if you don't do something different I think you're going to be a tough situation color\nRight you've got a good point there and as far as travel goes uh I certainly want our listeners of the world to know that when that American team boarded the plane they did not turn right to go to the city\nThey made a sharp left turn on and that sort of ... half of them didn't even know they were flying I mean they woke up and then you have to be at\nA in Paris so that it is a\nGood time now in the show J uh we\nTake a look at some of the singles ah you know showing up when they do it counted well Dustin Johnson the world's number one he certainly didn't play like if you imagine in Sunday's singles he decides who's going to put a new Potter employed I mean God league a Sunday singles writing\nOr put a new partner in are you kidding me\nThere is a guy that you know ... you wonder what motivates yeah I mean he he seems to either be at\nThe top of his game or would rather be somewhere on a beach I mean I I I don't know again I don't think he's the kind of guy that get that excited about this uh another guy who has struggled mightily internationally in singles\nIs Jordan the speed and you know it was a weird the final couple of weeks for me not late in the the a tour a championship and uh like I said he he looked down the stretch like he was whining on every pot and to use and then we get the whole thing with\nOne of the guys on this team\nAnd then we get the whole thing with\nOne of the guys on this team whether you like him or not a ... and I'm not sure about him and that's Patrick Green but at least Patrick ... got to tell you what Hitler\nWe take a look at tiger and feel they've got no point we mentioned earlier we're going to give it a little passe tiger certainly had to be exhausted with that old comeback situation but quite frankly to look ... you would have been better suited\nAs a vice kept him in and the cheerleader says when he got to tear up there was nothing there\nLet me tell you something if I had the wherewithal I fly Phyllis ... and you and I practice for a couple of days at Normandy and we give them a run for their money the way they holy smokes and you know dean shambles that I'm that guy that you know what probably make the team and ... five an hour in Wisconsin and he just\nHe ... you know new essay has so many guys like a pet trickery like Bill ... and like a ... it's truly a go to the beat of their own drummer whereas it seems like you've got\nTwelve guys that are on the same page uh every time they pick it up in the the Europeans they've got to do something with getting this individual is out of this team and at least for three days or for a week come together and it just it's so obvious to us all\nAs I alluded to at the top of the show this was my fourteenth Ryder Cup a and you think it would be saying something right there that you would think that would be wrong you would think that it be safe to say I I've seen it\nAll before well when Phil Mickelson put his ball in the water on the part three\nThat ended a any chance of the United states swimming and I had never ever seen a concession a to a match and\nTo the whole Ryder Cup or ... I mean it's always reserved for the green when somebody misses a pipe\nFill them on a plane that would put it in the water and it was all over just absolutely amazing stuff what about a bubba Watson VX theory of bubba Watson certainly doesn't show me that he's really fired up about it\nBob it's almost like some of the guys don't want to be there I mean it just is you know and and I'm sure that they do and I'm sure they got so high that all that but it just it doesn't seem to work again there's another guy hit talk about going to the beat of your own summer\nHe's got a whole a Turkish girl that he goes\nYou know all this talk about guys playing practice rounds leading up to it during the tourist season and\nFear and being out there and still competing\nI mean you for everything was moving in the right direction\nYou've got a you know this maybe the second grand ... player in the world off the uh when uh for over Fifteen hundred days and that momentum coming over on that and then he goes over the planets aligned heroes and they collide it for the usa\nI'm On a foot two ideas by huge Jay after spending some time on the Eiffel Tower or my head clear it a little bit and I tried to think of a possible solutions and these are polar opposites but no one is I think that uh the twelve point or news\nShould make the team that would eliminate captains fix it but if you earn your way onto the team you're on the team second would be to have nobody earn their way onto the team captain have the liberty to pick twelve players that he thinks will help win the Ryder Cup\nEither one of those ideas appear to appeal to you ...\nIf if you put a gun to my head and a lot I Would take would be the first I don't think anybody wants to have the responsibility of pick an average guy I mean because I was just say thirty guy she could take\nAs opposed to getting in a situation where you might have ten guys are in any given year where you got to pick horrible uh but I don't mind saying okay here it is it mapped out you know what you gotta do the top twelve guys play on the ... team\nGo for it here it is a if you want to play play as much as you can to make the team if you don't want to play in the Ryder Cup finished third day you know what I mean is it might surprise me if he had a couple of guys that don't want to deal with it\nWell when we take a closer look\nAt the captain's pigs and\nBoy loses jump on the page of the time I heard a lot of criticism\nBeing directed the Thomas beyond way when he picked Sergio Garcia who had aren't yeah allows a year or when he picked to you know and pulled to the pig can reach then sent a well\nHis his the numbers in and not show him and this was really telling a United States captains picks\nEarned a grand total of two point two points\nAnd they were both by Tony female\nBeach and bow woods Mickelson ... and Thomas beyond for pigs or lay earned nine point\nWhether we lose by seven points so I mean if you want to oversimplify it all the way up to do is look at the final tally and see what the difference was in the captain's pigs and you have your answer\nBut here is the case in point Bob the majority of people who follow in copper game agreed with the ... now they didn't work out that's obvious Bob\nJust get the numbers I mean the ... economy being the only one of the ... to\nGet his name up on a on a winning side of the thing is very disappointing bill ... is is more a little disappointed when it's almost embarrassed and ... ... quack I said is the guy that he had a little over three days if it's not filling right\nWith the way he approaches to gain and it's such an individual that you know it it can buy a car so\nNot always but often that I like to agree with Bob alive but I think he's left a little dumbfounded well Bob and I think we're all searching for a answer me play better is always a good way to do it\nI I like a formula ... play better but rush still take care of itself
