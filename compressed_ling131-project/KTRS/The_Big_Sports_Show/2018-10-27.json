a huge deal\nIt is a huge deal and it tells you which direction the programs moving I think to me you know there's there's things called signature wins\nAnd if you want to say that Kentucky doesn't count as one I think there's an argument to that look Missouri's favored in this game um so that let's keep that in mind they usually has a pretty good sense of what's going on but also you know they're all suffering from the country and they played very good football this season I I've been a Kentucky since the season started\nAnd and you know they if they have continued to deliver\nThe

there are a number of\nThings that we talked about going into the game and one of them was was getting out to a fast start and you want that to happen and and most certainly did for [noise]\nFor our team on on Saturday afternoon and and you know I think of the game of momentum as is very very strong and\nEspecially in in college ball or when you have that you got to find ways to keep it and when when you don't have it on your side line then you you've got to find a way a one play at a time to battle back and hang in there\nCoaches Kentucky comes to town Saturday you know they're coming off the fourteen standing win against standard will is there something about the way they played it lends itself to low scoring football games\nWhile they're really really good on ... and you look at any

a real good quarterbacks new and they've got a a good a one two punch at Tel back is as anybody in the country and you know they don't have any problem if if they run the ball on first down and ended

is strictly outside backers so you know it's bad move on\nEric Red white or just been let go with the whole staff there in Indianapolis for the call and those were extensively was\nReally helps him at Christmas but the other thing\nI can tell he got fire trucks flying by\nLeaf\nWho was the other day he was at the\nI think it might have to track and he was a starter was about to lose was starting up and the kid is that what we're looking at a really nice year but the most important thing of all over the last four years they had a kid who's just didn't work out\nSounding the Alabama for recruiting office\nBut he never became a really good that she will now you're up there last spring when Clinton Hannah knows guard\nSecond tier team in the SEC ease tendency pay as that bottom feeder ... they did this just maybe that spot\nWhere they've liberals because for the balls to go in there to Columbia South Carolina and pull off this when I I mean I'm not sure what we've learned out of this but in terms of pecking order I think this game tells us a lot Saturday Night\nI I agree I think I think South Carolina wins that one I really think Tennessee hit its high water mark with us when at Auburn\nAnd not to discredit ... that's a big win that's the kind of when that Germany Pruitt can point to it's kind of when that let's be honest with very old I'm Still looking for the want a new coach can say look this is this is what we do here and it might take some time but but this is you're seeing here seen glimpses of the sunshine\nThrough the clouds and and I don't know that Tennessee\nIs a I don't know that South Carolina's all that good but I I really just don't think that much of Tennessee this year they got a big win at Auburn yet crushed by Alabama reality sets back in there is some friction down there you got Jeremy ... called out his team for not being ... having a roster that's not prepared to play Alabama\nI'm it's some tough times down in Knoxville they got a one to build off on I don't think they're going to get another\nThat I'll tell you what looking at the bottom of the user division and to think that there's not a whole lot of strength and I hate to say right now Missouri's in that their own three in the SEC so when you look at Tennessee Missouri and Vanderbilt\nThere's one when ten losses with those three teams and so if someone that'd be that'd be\nYeah somebody's got to be guided by the word order out and and I would agree the that sort of see when a earlier a jets probably going to be yet\nNot a lot of national championship implications your fellows protects the CNN and Mississippi sinking Saturday Night uh down in ...\nMississippi states favored by two and a half a ton I mean a ton of action in on taxes and as we sit here right now they are the popular back in this game I was really disappointed\nIn ... Mississippi State later huge a sort of right off the ballot Fitzgerald turned up all over at first driving LSU in by your bangles really did not let up\nOr down in Baton Rouge and again I I've been one that has been bought into LSU but\nFor a guy that everybody everybody was really hot detract from Mississippi State at the start of the year with Nick Fitzgerald being one of those you know a senior leader quarterbacks a veteran to be ... to me Mississippi State spin a bit of a disappointment this year and they can't beat\nTaxing am I'm not sure they have a really any opportunities left now um I guess they still do they still play Alabama maybe they do I'm not sure there are opportunities for a realistic Markey when I think they're running out of them to be honest with\nYou I think the fans are start bill um are going to be holding those call bills are going to be a whole lot of cowbell noise a sucker against a un out\nI think they're going to need a little more cowbell and not have enough I Am looking at you know three straight wins and they haven't been pretty but they've been three in a row they got their their tail whip at Alabama they came out they beat Arkansas they beat Kentucky in overtime\nAnd then they just beat South Carolina on the road on the road again I think I think jumbo it's not it's not greased up like he wanted like he will Abbott eventually but he's got a role in a little bit right now not\nYou know jumbos got a to point loss to clumps and that they very well could have one at home\nOh it's got a to point loss to Columbus and that they very well could have one\nAt home I Do but they also they weren't exactly embarrassed by Alabama forty five to twenty three or a few weeks back and he's got three straight wins you talk about ... early well maybe your chance to get you both Fisher has already passed yeah specially\nFrom Mississippi State team is lost three of us less for you that there are just a\nBig time disappointment down there uh for me in stark ville um anything else you get not a lot that stands out in the FCC this weekend other than those games dandy that Arkansas felt let's talk about um talk about the bottom feeders to me Arkansas\nArkansas shown a lot and the Vanderbilt defense again good they again they went toe to toe with Kentucky this past weekend and hung in there until the until the very bitter and I do kind of like Arkansas in this game although it is important to note\nThat the line has a really swung in this game Arkansas opened up two and a half point favorites there now point and a half\nDog to give you an idea that a lot of the action early came in on Vanderbilt not a lot of implications but again for Arkansas two teams are predictably would being hidden in the opposite opposite direction first year coach down in Arkansas but\nYou have to wonder if ... is it just isn't his swan song in Nashville\nYeah I'll take the doors and this one ... I think the defense is going to be able to go and I won't be pretty end up could very well come down to the end but I'll go Vanderbilt\nIs a crazy wiccan is you see when you don't have Alabama Auburn New donor that was the right you don't have an old ... you know you got for us it's just one of those weekends of the conference words for the soft\nWho is Missouri and uh obviously Kentucky the moral as well as Florida in Georgia in Jacksonville\nFor me the biggest game out of the FCC fellows it's two thirty in the big tent Iowa at Penn State a hawk guys blanked Marilyn this past weekend I was still in the mix for the Big Ten west in fact Iowa\nNorthwestern Wisconsin and now Purdue after being you know I say they are all in play all still mathematically very much alive for the Big Ten championship game for Iowa do they play a brutal scheduled down the stretch your starting here with Penn State\nUm can do the Hawkeye stand a chance on the road\n[noise] ah I don't know it's a toss up for me I mean this is a this is one right I Can't I have a hard time picking it so when I have a hard time picking that I picked the home team thing and then I'm going to\nPenn State Penn State getting a Penn State six and a half points favorites uh over the Hawkeye here do you like I'm I'm surprised you know Penn State pick preseason top ten obviously I I was going up but I you there's almost looks to me like a line that should be double digits in in favor of Penn State it's not one\nOf the house they went in there to happy belly and and the buckeyes they'll go through that\nYou know everybody goes and looks like Alabama buckeyes way for the national championship and of course last week had no idea that was going to take place and then there are some other things I guess going beyond\nThe seeds in Columbus and you ... you know we're we're not going to need to know but I I don't see I don't see\nParents said losing that happy valley again to Iowa\nI like Penn State and I was a different team away from Iowa City this looks to be again the Penn State could roll but we've seen stranger things the Iowa defense has been legit so far haven't really played anybody but this is their chance to get that Markey when\nAt Purdue goes on the road ...
