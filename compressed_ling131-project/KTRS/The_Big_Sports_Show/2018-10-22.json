I've had a uh as far as [noise]\nMax on moving around by the tea are at a\nMan and I still can't believe it Max's an NBA fan as well it's funny\nAnd you know on the show we've talked about the best baseball movie has talked about the best football movies with hockey season started we talked about the best hockey films and so because basketball season is in full swing as of last night and of course with my Orlando Magic playing tonight I thought I Would talk about the best basketball movies\nLet's do it um I ... it comes to my Gene Hackman me you know\nThe west or you might be on the list are the very last\nIt's arguable you're one of the greatest pilots are but I'm going to start with one which I have a connection to my team the Orlando Magic and that's a film directed by William freak and he's the guy who did the French Connection with us right yet you also did the the exorcist\nBy those oil yeah so you're not thinking in the guy who did the the action crime movie and the guy who did or did the horror film it's going to do with sports movie but he became kind of obsessed with Bobby Knight\nOf course you know who is a legend in his own time and he and his own mind ... the guy who loved to throw the or the chairs and yell at all the kids and so he got Nick Nolte each to do sort of a fictionalized version of Bobby Knight\nAnd this movie actually costs are Shaquille O'Neal when he was just about to be drafted by the magic on said was a kid named him pretty hard away or you know Shaq was so impressed with making the movie the he demanded the magic take a look at him all of a sudden\nThey're they're the eastern conference championships because of this movie it's called blue chips oh yeah sure and so it started streaming right now on I Choose any it's it it it's definitely a good film as long as you can stomach the Bobby Knight is a ... of\nOf ah Nick multi meeting he's kind of in your fixture sit there in the movie about Bobby Knight like well any five years ago I'm not going to say that I mean she she actually and ignore the a shattered Bobby Knight to kind of get his mannerisms but it's not a ... version of him so he's just another coach who get angry here in the ...\nThe Bush ships definitely worth watching shack\nNever really quit his day job sanctuary as a broadcaster now he was an amazing basketball player not really the best actor so you're going to have to forgive from here with a a a blue chips that would of course all about basketball\nThen I've got one that has basketball in the title but it's not really about basketball there is a fantastic writer who I adore named Jim Carol and she's sort of a counter culture hit the writer or in the in the late seventies\nAnd she's sort of a counter culture hit the writer or in the in the late seventies and um she was just amazingly brilliant he became friends with Patti Smith the started\nDoing some punk rock music a couple of great records has a record them Catholic Boy which is really really good but he also did a whole lot of heroin\nNow here's the thing if you want to be a really successful writer maybe don't do a lot of trucks unfortunately a lot of them do whether it's mccaskey drinking himself to death or what have you and the way I mean for whatever reason creative people tend to ah ah do that so he wrote a memoir about his younger life called the basketball diaries\nAnd it was so named because he was a really talented basketball player in his Catholic school and of course that went away when he got more and more into heroine\nLeonardo DiCaprio players Jim Carol in this movie\nMaybe I've seen it then it has a really fantastic soundtrack including a fleet from a chili peppers it's got Pearl Jam on it and one of the coasts are Mark Wahlberg right after he was mark and mark\nIn the funky bunch and there was a Mark Wahlberg why seeing a movie now of course your modified box office our National Basketball diaries kind of a depressing film obviously with all the heroin however if you've ever read ... work he's an amazing amazing poet and writer [noise]\nThoughts on Netflix today as ... and at the Capitol was probably about Ninety five or so and so the kids before touching it gets right around the same time as Romeo and Juliet and that same kind of in a way yes you've ever so basketball diaries is what that was called\nIt we've got a comedy that when I said the so called people now to go for I guess there is a basketball movie seat off\n[noise] I never saw it never so I Know yeah I Know I haven't ... I Know\nNow I Know you'll love Jason Bateman do she was Tina wolf to T O O rights ... which is a horrible horrible terrible well he was like his cousin or something is like oh ... mixed as an\nAdult faculty Fox yeah was one of his first big starring roles and I'm right around the same time as a ... to ... he becomes aware wolf but it sort of hiding it from people write in and murdering people and said he throws tigers and uh and goes out as they were all on the basketball court\nMade I'd asked one should do you want to his whole school rallies behind him as a just a wolf as long\nAs you know I don't think that that's about what ever actually work in real life because think about it whenever I was in high school I had a lot of our hair out of me and Jim all the time he had like an entire face covering hair hair everybody's cheering for\nThis just and she will not a true story [laughter] member on him in the eighties comedy classic\nWhich guys and I've seen to a comedy failure a giant flop at the box office will ... yes\nDoes routinely dismissed on line people who love Talladega Nights or or the other sports movies you learned a lot of sports I did like it though I Love this movie it's called semi pro Woody Harrelson than it was fantastic if you Andre three thousand from outcast\nAnd this guy I'm double Will Ferrell as sort of a he's a he's the cook a cool foreigner of and a BA team called the Pelican Bay 'cause this is yeah and uh and it's just I'd love to swim I thought it was extremely funny and I was having a ball watching it and give it a really positive review\nOn my movies show and then it just died on the vine nobody ever talks about it and that was dramatic on Amazon right now called semi pro if you like Will Ferrell give it yeah it is very funny\nAnd then of course you were talking about earlier guy who's yours the hack\nThem arguably the greatest basketball film of all time it's got an amazing speech at the end of course which is what you want in the sports movie like this\nAnd that it really is no better character actor the Gene Hackman or watching him a lot of these young men to victory is just an amazing amazing story or as we hit the brake here because a medicine that we have to go to traffic which is fine I wanted to give a special dishonorable mentioned\nTo a movie that a lot of young people seem to hold in high regard and all this is a film I I'm forty okay guy so I was a bit too old when this film came out I never saw\nAnd um I kept seeing younger people people in their late teens early twenties say well there's things that a work of art this thing is a legend this thing's amazing I Can't believe this and I finally washed up to other dictators string it\nNow I understand it's not for me except for forty year old is for is for a kid I get that bad movies\nLike if you say space than you are still camped out talking about a movie that LeBron James is talking about doing the job might as well and now I'm\nSpace GM is it ready and stick it laid ever on TV I always sit and watch how creepy is the introduction of Lola Bunny I like you know how creepy as the introduction of Lola Bunny have you watched it recently now go to YouTube and just typing Lola Bunny first thing you tell me how creepy and that's you know I\nThink it has some added feminism ...\nMichael Jordan and outside of mine and we thank you and your age child sorry I'm On my\nBill Murray who loves the NBA as well yeah that came in it just because he loves you land so he did a random cameo which is really funny but it was based jam or wisdom is not a good move ...\nJazz dance as to the max on movies are let's get on your on line if I'm Out on Twitter at max on Saturday deal this is max you're listening to maximize movies on the big five fifty K.

I don't say Maxwell and doing All right you and I had a date earlier this week we went to go see\nHalloween because you were on my case about this for about six months max you have to take me to this movie\nBS I was I'm a big ... grew up watching it as a child and I was very excited for them to do a sequel not a remake to the original one and yeah I Want to talk about it with you on your show today\nSo you and I are sort of the um exception to the rule most people have seen Halloween hundreds of new John Carpenter classic one of the best slugger pictures of all time just I think I voted in three different format to love that film I watched a million times\nHowever very few people have ruined the gauntlet of watching every single Halloween spinoff remake side pool sequel\nAnd you and I have ... we shared an office and we realize that when we're talking about all the different sequels and prequels in cycles that we've seen all of them and even the bad ones I think we've enjoyed a little bit\nJust a little bit I mean I like the Halloween five revenge Michael Meyers you seem not to like it I kind of agree with you it's one of the worst in the stadium or if they're out there doesn't explain a lot\nYou're a big age too old fan I Am Jamie Lee Curtis is she's back in this movie and I think it helps the franchise out a lot\nCan we agreed that the best Halloween films as a rule involved Jamie Lee Curtis\nAbsolutely because you have for dinner and you know hairs and the general Harrison four or five and she wanted to come back with six but they recast or for that was probably for the best\nSixers are one of the worst ones but of course she was also in Rob zombies Halloween Halloween to try to do that you told me that rose like wow that she wasn't so she's been in for as well or dental Harris has been in for Halloween films as Jimmy lord\nAccumulate Curtis as worry strode has been enforced and it was in Halloween\nHalloween to back in the seventies eighties and then of course ... and H Forero which is really what they should have called this one which is called Howard [noise]\nGet downstairs [noise]\n[noise]\nTo explain the people the concept that uh the daily McBride uses screenwriter here because I'm very surprised she wrote that he's he's a comedy guided this is the end of your high and there's a lot of really funny films but he loves and held in franchise like like you and I have many teamed up with his good friend David Gordon Green threat who directed pineapple express which he was also in\nAnd out to do this new version of Halloween to explain the people have this is different than the other shops\nOr this one is different because this one is a pretty much a sequel to the very first one so you can cut out Halloween to back in Nineteen eighty one I Believe all of them\nAnd that is a very major distinction because yes what happened in Halloween to\nUh and that one just they were revealed that they are brother sister didn't return is Laurie Strode and mark on Mars or brother and sister and this one they ...\nThey are not relate as the first time that that's been scratched up because every other timeline and yes it's very confusing but the foreign timeline would they know Harris still had a family\nConnection robs zombies to ... made the family connections huge runners and of course even ... her brother so this is the very first time since the early eighties and that they have not been related to me it's a head scratcher\nMichael mind seeing them being killed his sister\nIt's a head scratcher Michael my scene and being killed his sister when he was six years old and he came out to eat just tell you why we want to get him inside his mind\nMichael Meyers murdered five ... he's a human being we need to understand a transfer\nAnd happy not to ... to the ... the idea that already we saw him\nAnd I think he might speak with you\nThis second one is because it's a it's a it's a head scratcher like it really is because it's one of those movies where there's nine previous Halloween films\nBut I I don't understand the motivation of erasing the family bought\nAnd to uncover is involved in this movie for the first time since that second film back in the early eighties or use executive producer here you also does the film score he also did this war for that first and second how in film\nAnd my favorite aspect of this movie is that score is really wonderful I'm there it's a ominous moody and are really helps the movie when when the movie isn't great the music always is and\nI I like the ... of all the original score of this because it picks up a little bit you know the results growing Halloween it's very slow very frightening but this one actually picks up a little bit of some drums behind it picks up and because if you if you watch the movie Michael Meyers\nIs not as slow as we know that he's very fast paced this time around and he's really out to kill a lot of people and they even said back in Seventy eight you'll you'll five people ... he\nHe pretty much doubles that troubles that almost think\nSo he's trying to think I was thinking of it might be right around that same number I was thinking five or six I think so you get a lot I'd have to really think about it until about five people in that first first time you ... you and I were talking about how this movie would be received a very differently and I think I think it will do well as the box office but it would be received very differently\nHad we not had any sequels ever if this was a very first movie after forty years to involve Michael Meyers\nGilead cheering in the aisles and a true enough at the screen that we saw at the Esquire people wearing Michael Meyers shirts somebody to even get in here where the line around the block so the anticipation for this is awfully high and I think some younger audience members might\nNot realize the Jamie Lee Curtis came back Twenty years ago for age to older and they're so excited to see her back now how is she in this film proceeds phenomenal she's a great actress and she's a great once again as a slightly different more hinge Dolores roads\nWhat's terrifying that meant that there is no rhyme or reason that really it is nothing he is nothing in in that ... that and they get mad at [noise]\nIs they embody mental pure evil and that's why it's so terrifying\nYou have the younger generation aren't used to it and it also pays tribute to the older generation because you had the grand daughter and she's an only in high school and they had this like get together party over at the high school and it kind of pay tribute to resurrection a little bit so I don't know if you noticed that\nAnd then you know the older generation Jamie Lee Curtis in her daughter who kind of pays the whole image of the Halloween four or five and six a little bit\nThey're boys so uh yeah because in this film Laurie Strode Jimmy ... I'm ... obsessed with the ah the babysitter murder of Michael Meyers which they didn't name check in the movies or the shape at one point answer her daughter's taking away from her by child services\nWhich is sort of similar to what happened to the character Jimmy lord played by Denzel Harris and the foreign trilogy a but here she's played by Judy Greer who is an actress also known for comedy and that that that is why I'm a dentist McBride wanted to her because she could do something more dramatic here and she's fine she has a standup scene towards the end it I'm not going to spoil here at all [noise]\nUm until March Madness and that's why not get that it's all good but\nI just I I feel for everybody associated with this with this tiger basketball program April second to the fourth\nIs is about for the tournament that I teach tournament April ... the two finals\nOh yes that's a final okay ... and again and and obviously down to Madison Square garden right cause us to say when I started I think it's like a day or two after a selection Sunday I think it's a day I finally started to say but anyway\nTo after a selection Sunday I think it's a day I finally started that Tuesday but anyway there is this a few again it day here and there were there's no basketball maybe around Christmas Time to think there's a couple of a\nCouple of days around Christmas when uh they don't actually get out there and play it's all fun and good a ton of point being is a ton of college basketball is coming up and I and I feel like being Suzie as ... who is gonna is gonna ... gonna be damp and do a little bit and it's a shame [noise]\nNow I tweeted this out last night at the end you'd feel free to hit me up anytime they these next two and a half hours will will read them as we go along or you can call it nine six Nike T. R. S. [laughter] you know for those of you folks that are listening that are you know true\nDie in the wall was outta tiger football fans\nWhat what what's that moment what is the pivotal moment where you were you just say there's no doubt this program is cursed basketball football anything and everything it's on the table what\nIs that moment because I asked her top five ... ... ... ... and and I and I got a lot of the same\nYou know fully kicker against Nebraska fifth down against Colorado pie said knee Nineteen Ninety five second round of the NC double a tournament against UCLA Norfolk state\nThere's a lot that\nPivotal that one that stands out among the rest some that I didn't hear\nThat I I certainly think deserves some consideration\nDo you remember Ricky Clemens Ethan\nDo not okay so he was the uh the point guard in mid to thousands who got into a little bit of trouble it I'm sort of snowball from their Ricky Clemens basically brought an end to the Coen Snyder\nRegime at Missouri which started the kind of sounds like a D G below ... while she was Ricky Clemens didn't uh didn't that seemed like a great dude and into it it's it's\nIt's just one of those moments where you're you sort of shook her head and said this is this is this is totally the zoo\nAnd it it did not work out all that well how about the about the miss miss feel go against South Carolina back in two thousand in Thirteen at home which quite honestly cost the tigers and opportunity and that has seen it granted they lost Auburn a several weeks later in the SEC championship game\nBut it hadn't been to beat in South Carolina\nWould have gone into that game against Auburn as the leader of the Columbus to get to the national championship game maybe ... or the no question about do you want to feed them the FCC you're all on your in the national championship game no arguments absolutely no arguments\nOn I think about was when the committee picked um Kansas over ... was that\nOh we have the ... was after the o seven single seven yeah yeah I get ... and I heard that too that to me it didn't bother me as as much as I get it there was all a lot of people that were tipped off\nBecause it was a slap in the face to visit will be Kansas you beat Kansas on a neutral field\nYour the better team why is Kansas is going to be cs game and you're having to go play Arkansas in the cotton bowl Darren McFadden by the way was dominated that came out and you remember back then it it was like at ten am too frightened early wake up New Year's day was it was already playing\nWas Arkansas team that had Felix Jones during McFadden Peyton hill a song same team yeah and they ...\nThey did for zoo Missoula role demos that scene because that was when the zoo that was when the zoo was briefly number one in the country\nOr for a week where it was changing every single week and it was that are that Arkansas team had beaten no at the time number one LSU and that was remember that Arkansas team gave the birth\nOf the wildcat quarterback Darren ... running the ... [laughter]\nIt's like [laughter] that'd be remembered I became a thing in the national football league for what the next four to five years or using the wildcat quarterback you know who did this\nOne guy with a Miami Dolphins a white mounted on up out why he's he's dead I get on this one on U.S foreign out stuff that goes to it but I don't it while yeah Tony a\nTony ... nuts Tony ... Tony Soprano yes Tony Tony Soprano has had it passed how I was to penalize has not dead as as far as I Know but that Miami team was utilizing though with the wildcat quarterback and it wasn't a it wasn't it was that guy with\nThe Auburn the running why brown Ronnie Brown brown yeah you're\nAbsolutely right Ricky Williams was there to anything you you know they did they use Ronnie drives the wildcat quarterback and Ricky Williams would always be linked to his right southern sting Tibet he played with a kind of like Williams that all of our to feed [laughter]\nCadillac Williams has to run like a Cadillac so does this give that some ... you know your ultimate your\nPreeminent moves zoo cursed moment\nUm to me I think the the fleet kicker to me is is probably number one\nTo ah to Nebraska because that's what I still vividly remember but there are a lot of candidates there's no question about it but again it's it's it's a downer Jayanti Porter done for the season for the tigers let's continue here on\nFor one gigantic coming out [noise] as we go along blues\nPlay tonight against the Winnipeg Jets\nFinally feel good about uh you know again the only give up a goal Toronto is pretty good for on the board you get a win on the road takes a little pressure off tonight if you if you were to go have a ... trip then facing what seven straight at home\nThe pressure Neal could be a Mets because I I think that's all I'm\nSaying it's going to tell us a whole heck of a lot\nAbout what this hockey club does the rest of the way that this is this is really going to get second very weird for me to say that I I I'm not one to buy into October and November hockey\nTelling us the whole lack of a lot but this to me is going to be critical for a team that's gotten off to sludge or to such a slow start Alex ... said earlier today a courtesy of the blue note productions that\nIt's the first time this team politically game\nWe have played welfare of games are just trial for some reason or another and [noise] there's always the\nFirst time you've played a full sixty minutes and it certainly did show on the ice tonight after he sat out the old healthy scratch ... back in the lineup here's Mike yo\nI mean it's pretty good lectured hourly both come back on the line of obviously that was a that was a real difficult decisions are tough ones when you've got a guy as professional as having that especially with the career that he's hiding you know how difficult that is for him so I'm happy to see if I can wind up and a for profit there's got to do for a while for us\nBut I mean you you just moving forward you can't utilize bomb Easter on the first pairing right you just can't do it\nDon't I don't see how you can't I I was there in a tight spot here with 'em or trees or sounds like we're going to be out for quite a while I mean he's fully formed by St Louis but Mr has been awful\nIt will be out for quite a while I mean he's fully formed by St Louis but Mr has been awful this year I I don't see how he can play more than eight minutes a game well\nYou're in rewrite be with with four to those injury sort of forces the hand of Mike yo and and boom Easter again how prominent role is it a tonight will ah will just have to wait and see but you know quite frankly I liked getting done up there in a higher high profile role we talked about that with the tea last week\nIt was soon ... only going to get better it's tough for him and he's gotten up to a pretty rough start tougher him a tougher to really be\nAll that much worse moving forward to be quite honest with you but what if there is awfully good to give you you know you've got the opportunity to get a pretty critical\nDivision when and like I said that ... when you when to out of there at the way that things started\nThis Canadian trip started to to go back and get another win tonight really sets you up nicely but like I said I I I think this upcoming road trip is going to be significant and\nA a big test no question for the blues moving forward ah let's move along one more hit here on our sports\n\nGame one is set World Series Red Sox then yes it's the Dodgers it would've been fun to see the brute crew I tell you what game seven\nGame sevens are usually pretty electric and there was so much to watch on Saturday Night he was like you're going back and forth get me to get me gave seven oh skinny or to produce Ohio State get me over to\nWell what else was going to give me over yeah give me over to the blues getting if you had so much all happening at once we Christian yellow ... in the first inning smacks a home run off Walker buell er", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "22"}
