I'm ... Hill who he was very quick he was good won't be one defender or last week called got pulled out of position a couple of times so it was able to get in behind him when he vacated the line\nSo I think you'll see Tyler staying at home more often hold him but he doesn't give you the presidents are over ...\nSo it'll be interesting to see how that played out offensively for St Louis fc feel positions Tony walls and Louis oh we'll talk about first those too\nYeah you know I think there they'll they'll certainly protect the to send our backs it will be very difficult for okay see to get through the center of the park um\nYou won't have the conductivity that you have with wall but to you know to really frightening I mean it's amazing to me that you can lose somebody of wall falls ability and still have Tony walls and Louis silt and as your center midfielder level\nWe talked about it a number of times but if your first time on the broadcast Tony walls plays anywhere and when he's a fence he can be a shutdown guy yeah\nFor sure he's he's a he's an impact guy and he's a good complement for\nFor Louis on the wings estimate field it's cutting ... acres on one side of Joey college tree on the other\nMan you know it's where we started and gone through a whole bunch of different rotations and now we're we're finishing with it a ... diem is a very tricky very explosive unpredictable tough to deal with um that that'll be interesting match\nUp Richard Dixon with ... diem I'm assuming ... will be on the left side 'cause he likes to come in and hit a which is right and college street has been studying and very good as well and you know I think the thing about ... he went through a time during the year where he struggled to get time remembering what they're like three or four games where he wasn't getting any time\nUm and just a competitive nature of the team the maturity of the group uh he is one just fought back and now he's getting human minutes now up\nTop it's a new combinations and we mentioned Carl Greg is out with the injury it's Cory hurts sock and Michael Cox how nice\nIs it that you have the luxury of of playing a guy that has had hardly played any ... any minute but hasn't had a major role in this team and Michael Cox and be good enough to to put into the team for this particular game\nBy the way this is the third week that we're going to say this is the biggest game in franchise history it is but Cox now is is getting a start in in a game that's extremely important and playing alongside of uh of hurt suck so\nA Anthony certainly nobody's questioning his choice he must have seen something in training over the last couple of weeks that has warranted to switch\nMichael got speedy can play a lot of different ways though too is not just the one guy from\nTony in and let's let's also ... we can't forget this St Louis played Wednesday night and equal put in an incredible amount of work and that and that particular game so\nMaybe what he's going to do is flip the difference for a ... and a and hurt sock and we'll see hurts all get sixty or so and Dick would try to finish up again\nSpeaking of the reserve lists for St Louis tonight up top set Rudolph Albert decry got out he jumps in Austin march ... veteran backing off this Jake federal so I'm\nSure we'll see ...
