I had been I'm Sorry\nI look at it a little bit differently that there was some talk in the PGA within time that the next event St Louis might get might be the Ryder Cup so so if this is what goes on there then signed us up we'll get coverage out of this per day for for for a year if if if the next Ryder Cup if one of those is going to come here with all the drama that plays out\nThen do you think uh we'll all still be working because the next one that is available\nIs twenty forty working less funny about being a lot of working with them on\nThe next Ryder Cup is twenty forty Luis wants to chime in\nFor me I'm going to be working on that now main St Louis but maybe going to the news to arrive customer ones more than one more time\nThan that's got to be the number one priority over everything else right yeah ... it's the most glaring\nWeaknesses on this ball club for a team that was trotting out Paul beyond as their number three hitter for much of the final few weeks of the season that that that should tell you all you need to know as much as I think they need help\nFrom the left side in the bullpen as much as you could use it upgraded third base in in right field first and foremost you have to find that number three hitter by or what what's the old seen ... by hook or crook you've got to figure it out right here right now\nBut the cardinals are traditionally not a team that says hey we're gonna do and you know blow up our whole roster around the woman guy and we add there in the past years especially they'd been I've seen that identifies a weakness or two or three and then I go out and try to fill them\nWe've seen that with extra fallow they wanted at center building we'd off here um we saw that with my ... sooner they identified the need of a cleanup hitter and they went out and traded for\nMarcel you start with Brett Cecil even we have a we need to really go get them my clique so I think I think that's probably going to be similar here I think they're going to identify their weakens positions that would be right field where there is a bit of all a bit of a bit of a stress point that we just spent some time talking about the other one is is third base\nWhere I think that's another spot power producing spot that could hit in that third\nSpot in the order or something in the meat of the line up like your right fielder could or should and then you have that to me is is is this but at the spot that you have to look to upgrade if you want to be better next year Jericho as in the past put up numbers like a starter could there his power is taken another step back his powers dropped significantly\nYes it was three years with the team um dramatically show to download download eleven home runs this year and he's having a he's had a hard time staying healthy is proven kind of over the course of the time here that you really can't rely on him\nHealth wise for a whole season as a starter he's\n... he's good at the ... guy I'm off the bench rate just to the point where you think you might you might want to make them more and then he and his body gives up on your body breaks down on your show third base is really the the the spot where you look at\nThat the easiest place to add\nAnd and who can add there that take away from the you know the teams trying to improve it even let the majors in air the season also let the majors\nSince the change to show so that was he was on a magic cure there that far but they need some better defense and I didn't have anything to do what they had left to do with the managers than in some people thought I'm so third base to meet jumps out at another place you look at\nBut the managers than in some people thought I'm so third base to meet jumps out at another place you look at you know there's a case that can be made first starting pitcher um I think the I think I entered I understand that and I look at the both pet is just as you know yes every team needs to do both and maintenance than the off season I don't even\nSpend that much time worrying about that because it's literally the equivalent of you know of of spring cleaning when you when you build a team you have to picture both in every year for\nA new one who's freaking out about the open eye to eye in my opinion is ignoring some some rather large issues that should be at the top of the grocery list for this team\nI ... and and obviously\nThe or the left handed release who is something that could certainly work itself out along the way then Fredrickson with us in a then again he's got a five question column up on S. T. L. today dot com right now I'm\n... and the third base a little more Ben because it ... does your salary goes up here along the way the cardinals to have him signed I think\nFor two more years but uh but he's very dramatically decrease used as the contract goes up and as you said the power goes down a new we talked a lot about noon Gorman there a first round pick this year he's still a few years away and die should not act as some sort of\nA you know stumbling block to upgrading the position right now but you know outside of\nMany Machado through free agency Ben ... is there anything that jumps out and it's something that is that it could be released you let's say on a on the trademark it\nWell the the the most obvious obvious to their base options are going to be free agents and they're and they're playing in the postseason right now it's my wish pockets there's going to be a free agent after even with the brewers and it's and it's Josh Donald than it neither of those guys jumped out to me as guys who used to have that said that right that this theme\nAs Mitt thing but we stock assist played okay but the brewers\nPowers there I mean I don't think the major wildcard or what if the lights up the postseason and prove that he's healthy and and is that guy that MBP guy that the cardinals have been interested in for a long time I think the cardinals are gonna be watching him very closely\nUm this postseason to seek out he does not they would make that decision based on that but you want to see that he's healthy and you want to see that he can still be the\nThe guy that he was in Toronto for so many years so that's that's one ants potential answer at third base because as you said you don't really want to give a guy a mega contract to third base if you think no one Gorman is gonna be the future now it doesn't mean you don't get a guy who can help you more than you've had\nRecently but I don't know what I Want to give a super long term contractor guy that's going to be you know manning the position that we think this kid's going to be able to play here rather share to know and government is not\nAnchored to third base he could end up at first base I think if this building doesn't improve so you know the cardinals know about that better than that idea where he projects long term but Machado to me is a third base and I know he says he wants to play shortstop\nBut uh I mean if you look at the numbers he's much better at third right and I I think I you know the the other option is if you want to get in the shortstop debate you potentially move Paul the younger the third where he played coming up to the miners and I think you'll be fine there but the problem is that probably weakens your fans because\nIf you're going to get a short proper so good that moves Paul Young to third base that\nAre the chances are that's going to be a defense for shortstop who probably is more\nHelpful with the glove then is that right well all the young place pretty good pretty good short stop I mean the feeling bibles run saved\nThe truth that that I I like rank Tim third in baseball shortstop if he'd had fourteen runs above average\nSo is that how the cardinals view of the major league baseball views it maybe not everybody has their own metrics but Paul the no slouch at shortstop you got a lot better this year so the the the crowd that justifies moving hinder third just to get a glove to me that weakens your probably weakens your office\nBecause then you've got ... young thing and even more powerful position and probably a worst hit are playing shortstop\nSo I Would rather keep all the un where he's a power plug shortstop and then go at a at a at some sort of an increase bat at third base\nI think it depends on who the players are I I Can't evaluate just tune yeah I Would probably be a weaker guy that was probably going to be weaker guy I probably don't want him but and then the other thing is head to head straight up who's better defensively at shortstop\nOr young and then ended up\nWho's better defensively at third base your speaker out who the best guys in the best spots are it's not really I think we all sometimes not you are talking about all of us people in the cardinal nation were you worried about oh gosh I don't want to hurt his feelings and say he's not that good\nDoesn't matter you got to put your best guys in the best spots and so if he ends up being the best shortstop excuse me rather than third banks okay but if you bring somebody in\nAnd maybe the only difference is this guy's got a little more range wasn't moving ... why some third base it's it's not that big a deal I don't think\nWe'll have lightning miraculously struck the cardinals signed many Machado you know he could he could catch for all I care he's on the team still play but\nBut seriously you'd you'd put the guys were their best served in in maybe it wouldn't be keeping the youngest short in and shot to search ... played it in the big leagues where his paws not\nBut I don't know I Would be interested in McCain does opinion after each get a couple of hundred around her ... you know rather than to that\nHow you sell the ... the opening when we go recruit Mandy Machado are you telling them you're going to find him and plan where he fits fast or you're going to tell them and pledged to end that he gets to play short stop you know that's going to be I Would imagine that's going to be a pretty big chip in his a bargaining with teams during his free agent\nThat if he's dead set on being a shortstop and he's going to want to have a team that tells them hey you're short stop 'em and then at that changes and that opens up the door to have you told me one thing and did another you know that that can cause consternation never there that opens up kind of a Pandora's box of what can happen\nIt sounds like he's on shows like June golfer\n[laughter] yeah so I I think I think that's going to be a that is going to if he determined to play shortstop but she certainly seem to be you know when it came down to this trade deadline then that it'd be a that could be a a a discussion point for multiple teams as well\nAlthough ... who they are right you know the plates and search for the Dodgers though\nYeah some but he has made it very very clear that he is a shortstop and that's what he wants to play\nDon't cast also has a senior community and miles what to set up a consultation in tour and go on line to stone craft at tightened the dot com or skim past of loud ... dot com\nThe next generation of home improvement has everything you need to do projects smarter faster and for less every day the Home Depot more saving more doing\nSports show why do you are a\nSprint and we see Bob Ramzi bin ... five fifty shades she our ass\nAnd a lot more questions than answers will be out there after mole and company have their season ending press conference but until then we can do speculate and guys I\nThrew it out there before the break on touch the ball players that you think that you would rank ... and and we're not including Dexter Fowler or read well all\nI Want to get I Want to understand the rules are not going to be taught you need to understand the rules who we think the cardinals thinker untouchable or who who we believe should be untouchable\nWho you believe should be on TALK to no one touchable okay that's too there's a quick answer Ben from from ram or what they are if\nYou give me a good enough deal OK takes hours of entertainment and let me interrupt real quick here's the problem with St Louis fans and I noticed it\nShouldn't be looking games all these years I called them the cookie bakers in the sweater ... little bill Akins rah rah rah and\nThen you know you you don't make it to the tea or you lose in the United states but it's okay because we are going to bake cookies and its sweaters for our little bill against you know by the players and go when that's what sports are about winning and we got the same thing and cardinal nation\nWe like our guys oh he's such a great guy we we all know you can't get rid of him he's awesome I bought his Jersey [laughter]\nNo but if you can improve the genie among them who had been\nI think it goes to the other way to hear from fans in the channel it's time to say well don't you think it'd be good trade that carpenter and our values I\nAdmit that then candidate trade into it they held him where he can get a designated hitter and say\nOkay for what I mean this notion that get trade this guy\nBut the note they'll tell you what for like well you know trade him for a a a reserve outfielder no you're on a train 'em for you know the guy who was going to be your face facing your team for years to come back [laughter] pins on what the trade it for it I get that all the time all the\n... cardinals fans they they they seem to determined to think that the number of of of of mediocre bad players of the of the cardinals give up can some out there can be a magic\nNumber ... ... they would give them to get them one really good players like I Can't\nTell you how many times I hear things like where we package Brett he saw\nDexter Fowler anti on her own meal and Mike\nMyers then do you think we could get trout it's like yes the angels want to give you the most valuable player single player in baseball for four and bad players that's that's\nA great deal of the profit or what\nPlayers they don't want to give him and then of course they'll give you one best player in baseball now are are tend to um my uncomfortable if I make me laugh it's very short um it included\nJak clarity I think it'd be really good um it also includes Jordan heck because I think I think I think I think the cardinals can can shake the men do really elite closer and he's got stuff that nobody else has and baseball guys are making the league average league minimum for the foreseeable future which are like\nYeah I think my list begins and ends with some clarity I think that that's the one guy who you can project as a top will be order are toppled the rotation ace you hands him at a at a club control\nUm and it's it's\nAn actual in the area of your team I don't think you have to mess with Ben you mentioned it a little while ago about whether this team needs to go out and tinker with the rotation you don't need to the rotation I think we'll take care of itself next year I don't know exactly who's behind ... and Michael is with those two guys who were there\nFlared he's going to be around for a while I again is the easiest to young winter down the line I I don't know that might be a stretch maybe he'll contender year or two but you have a hundred club control he looked dynamite all throughout this year he's the one guy I'm not giving up\nUm it again you can get trapped sure I guess everybody's available if you're getting trout but um you know in the real world real world trades\nHe's the one guy I I I don't think I'm a I'm part with\nYeah and I get you know I hear this argument sometimes like turning a waiver and and sure maybe he could but waiver wasn't doing this\nAnd I'm not ready to throw the book out on the lever yet either we ended up at second year um but ... like the guy is is is washed up and beyond repair I mean he may be turned into reliever down the line I don't know but but I think\nHe was the ... pretty good player and then he's gonna he's gonna be mentioned the national the ... year discuss on those when that awarded him out rightfully is um he what strike out by rookies and it was like thirty he wasn't even close\nHum he led strike outs by rookies and it was like by thirty it wasn't even close\nUm he he was written up really elite category this year and he hit the wall toward the end of course he did it career high innings pitched\nHave never been there that Grider that is that that last leg of the major league season ahead somebody 'cause they ask me well what does what does this all about the ... you think that while they they when they want championships down and in the minor leagues too will get their season those those championships in the month before the the regular season then\nThese guys when we say they are in uncharted territory they don't know you don't know what it's like you've done it and now he knows what it's like\nAnd if we know anything about jak he'll be better off because of it and uh I just think you've got the right mentality and the right vision and kind of the as you just have the maturity beyond us years here I think he's a bulldog\nComponent that their value for a long time and he doesn't need to be the eighth next year but he might need to be the year after ... ... miles Michael is to me comes back at that guy next year I mean this we don't talk about a mile but her agree hum he might be uncomfortable at this point uh he\nHe was on the pictures of the national league and that's not you know no no qualification to it whether you look at his record as he ... he didn't strike a bunch of guys out so maybe it's not the sexiest sexiest starter but you look at you look at the way the team played a game that he started\nAnd and ... everything from a zero eight two innings pet to got to hunter innings which is very rare and where and this game where we're this team be filed Michael is and we were all we were all thinking the cubs they're the colonel should have got ... some of us\nI'm not me necessarily but uh there was that for that I hear that the cubs you'll get darker vision the cardinals get this mild Michael this guy how do you say the name of the Japanese have tons of ... on on the air at well it turned out to be pretty dang good\nWell we've got to run you're in second bend but you know the interesting thing about Michael is is I don't think the conversation is going to be should they train them I think the conversation would be shooting extend them because you sign for just one more year\nAnd I think uh I Would look long and hard at that you don't really like it here\nAnd he seems to have the right mentality um he wants to be here he wanted to be here you've got family in the area you're not paying more though in the remember this is the guy who wanted to your deal the cardinals wanted to give them more and he said no I Want to years because I Know my value or go up\nIf I tear it up and two years that's how confident he was in so far it's called the shot and he's like or it\nProjects in with the St Louis Post Dispatch ban what are you working on now I guess again kind of waiting it out to see when we get the uh the mole farewell press conference and then the circle blue cheese\nYou bet yeah I Would like to hopefully that's I don't know if that's going to be tomorrow what I haven't heard yet I'm with I\nHave that soon if they're going to do it um clues I'll be there Thursday\nUm got some new football back up back in ... ferrets plenty to break down there to the long chat about six six hours a day that's the only not calm so the recap from that will be up in the morning or you can go through and read it in its entirety and then they'll ram or likes to do uh every uh every Tuesday\nNo question about it you know one ... one quick taught about uh your colleague thought it was a really interesting story 'cause a lot of us were competing\nAfter the fact Christian yellow ... and ... Gould who was on yellow which early I mean like just a year ago will get for 'em but he really broke down today I saw\nHow the cardinals kinda got in that spot where they didn't get them and I thought it was really really good insight kind of inside baseball stuffer excellent job\nYou bet yeah well he ... he he's been holy over my head off season because I just wasn't sure if it was a good player but I wasn't quite sure that he was this kind of play I don't know that many folks were but there was adamant that he was your next breakout star he called it he did but he also points to the fact that\nThe cardinals had missed on Stanton the brewers one of the trade\nYeah a buddy to trade I was given a second at that point we're not saying they were going to trade yet which had mold yeah let's come spring training prepared to be a Marlin\nIn hindsight yeah you you may be bought from out or you hold out call their bluff and you prioritize getting tricked or what a bit more competition for you would've had to pay more because of his contract that I think if you if you look at what the what the brewers gave up they'd probably gave up their version of a player to eat dinner type\nWherever we got to go back for hanging out you'll be back with me talking more Missouri Valley conference in the eight o'clock hour Chris Klein joins us next talk in soccer here on the big five fifty K.

on the property our kids come and they trained and they and they eat here and they go to school here and so we're really touching every aspect or like\nThe hope is that that we can develop\nA players that will not only play for the galaxy in and play for our national team but we're really push the sport forward in this country\nWhere you you mentioned the national team bearing in than missing out on the on the world cup this past year I Know a lot of folks were were disappointed to see that do you see the national team is it is it heading in the right direction from your vantage point Chris\nWealth than the national team is one thing and the sport is soccer in this country is is another and and they are linked together so the fact that the the U.S team didn't qualify was a\nIt was a setback but it was also an opportunity for everyone to take a look at\nIt how we're doing things and and what we were doing\nA international team of collectively with within the last to work together so that we can have a national team that not only qualifies for six seats in a World Cup and so certainly president of US Soccer we have a new approach where we're likely to have a new coach for the national team and and we hope that this is\nA defining moment where we can look back and and everyone kept saying this is the reason that we're successful on the twenty twenty two World Cup and then ultimately with the twenty twenty search World Cup being in the u._s. um being able to position ourselves to really\nUm you know not only ran out of our group to make it far in the tournament of something that we're looking at and\nIt needs to everyone that needed it need people knew drank people and and the pressure ranks to push us forward child but the real defining moment for this for

get acclimated to the Missouri Valley conference\nThank you it's been a good day so far um this is probably as early as as I've ever done in media day so yeah I don't know quite as much about my team is as I've had in the past but um\nYeah I don't know quite as much about my team as as I've had in the past but um [noise] you know very exciting uh does this just means basketball's right around the corner a I grew up around the valley a played in the valley of coach ... valley so it's it's a it's a it's a special day for me to come back to the valley\nCoach hum is our first opportunity to talk to you since you got the job if you can't kinda ... what were some of the details about you are taking this job did you did you think it was going to be a possibility that you'd wind up in Springfield [noise]\nWould you know when the job first became available is definitely one that as a young coach that's had a little bit of success it's on your radar as the next step if you can get your name involved it's such a good opportunity from a basketball standpoint so uh it was definitely something that I Would have [noise]\nYou know when given the opportunity or if given the opportunity would have definitely been all over and when that opportunity presented itself\nIt was something that we you know tried to put the full court press on and and and try to make a reality so very fortunate to be the coach at Missouri state we we've got things in place that that should be able to help us build a consistent winter and I think that's what this is all about you know how are you going to be able to consistently developed\nGraduated to consist develop championships we we've got those things in place to do that so it's a great opportunity\nYou know with the the the infrastructure that's already there it doesn't mean it's easy to making the transition even with the team that you know one games and that sort of thing [noise] talk about when you you get hired you hit the ground what were the things kind of as you stacked up priority right why is that you had to take care of\nOr you know as soon as you take the job of all the focus should be on the players and and uh the ... the way the landscape is now you you gotta do recruit the guys on your own team and so that was my first priority was trying to figure out who is staying and who is going in that process took about\nFour to five weeks because there are guys coming and going everyday changing their minds and things of that nature and you know you kind of get you have to give them that opportunity because they they didn't sign up for coaching change\nAnd then there's some other uh factors that way in like a PR things of that nature and I'm just you know it it was it was tough uh those first couple of weeks just having an understanding of\nWho was on my team and then once you do that now you have to go out an ad which you feel like you need in order to get your program started in the right direction so outside of the recruiting aspect of my current players in in ... new players the only other thing I worried about was the people that were going to help me do that and that was my staff\nAnd so I had a pretty good idea of who that was going to be in and we just had to go through the [noise] the paperwork and and get all those things are a finalized but we're recruiting when you take over program has to be the biggest thing and and uh no matter what the program was like before\nIt's always going to be a setback when you have a coach and change [noise]\nWe're visiting with coach Dana for the new men's basketball coach at Missouri state you know coach your name had been bandied about for a few years is one of the young and up and coming\nCoaches did you hear that shattered while you're at Tennessee State what what do you think as you know some of the great minds of college basketball had had your name at the top of those lists a lot of those lists for sure\nYet and you know it's hard not to hear those things especially when when we were at a program like Tennessee State that had never ... I mean they had one in Thirty years\nAnd we had the biggest turn around and the NCAA one of those years that I was there and uh I mean we at one twenty games for the first time since Nineteen Seventy nine or something like that and and and you know when you do those things at such a young age it's it's it's just\nIt's almost impossible not to have your name mentioned somewhere [noise] I'm I'm so out of I was not surprised but I'm obviously you know we understand that it's a year by year business you know you've got to be good every year you can stay\nYou know that stuff in the past and and um when this job became available we felt like they were going to try to hire a head coach so we we felt like that this would be one that we could try to get involved with it and hopefully get and and I think some of our success at Tennessee State led to us getting this job\n[noise] and then we you know we talked about recreating we talked about staff and then you've got a schedule too and I notice you've got the uh set tournament in Kansas City hall of fame classic tournament that is a fantastic opportunity for you your club and really the league\nYeah I mean it's a it's a ESPN sponsored exempt tournament in in the middle of the week I mean you know you you really can't get any bigger than that and and then on top of that three teams who I feel all are going to probably been in the tournament this year Nebraska USC in Texas Tech\nUm as well as three really good coaches and then it probably four team out of that to the needs to be a writer I always joke was the owner of the day I was I mean we should be in this thing and and your three or four [laughter] but um we were excited because it gives [noise]\nOur university the opportunity to be on a national stage and um\nYou know obviously I think when you look at that field and you see us in transition\nAh we're not picked the when it but but we got the same opportunities everybody else and and how we kind of go about games is\nIt all you can win every game that you play you know there's a certain amount of things that you got to do in order to get that done but uh we're we're thankful for the opportunity and and and the with a good showing could probably find a way in more tournaments like this and then the next couple of years coach\nI Know you weren't there last year but they had a player by the name of ... Johnson who was pretty good data is very staid and he's gone and I think maybe a reason why there's so much hunger for successes here you have this ... you know NBA player and a\nMaid and maybe some folks look and see maybe we should have gone a little for fire there in in March madness maybe we should have had opportunities in the NC double a tournament what it is\nA kind of a two part question the and the expectations and the energy down in Springfield as you take this job and what does this roster look like after somebody that again dominated the ball so much like an ... Johnson is gone\nI think the biggest thing that we're excited about is our guys are doing it for us a little bit in terms of that culture piece um uh\nWe were pretty selective and that type of guys we want to recruit um you know trying to find guys that had a little bit that competitive edge to them\nUh and you know so far in our workouts this summer and fall I'm with you we've gotten that out of them are in a lot of its um because that's that's kind of how they are all wired anyway you know you put a group of guys like that in a room together and you get some pretty spirited practices\nCoach you bring experience or a long time experience from the staff at Creighton and obviously a program at a community that loved basketball program what are some of the principles that you bring from their sheer to drink\nI think the biggest thing I I was Twenty years and when I first got to Creighton or were they\nDana all they had just gotten there you've been there I think that was his third year if I remember right so they were just on just breaking through as well so it went from four thousand fans are back in Nineteen Ninety eight to almost Seventeen thousand fans at night\nAnd I think there's a lot of similarities between what uh Omaha and the ... in terms of cities and as schools creating a private school in on the holiday inn drink a private school in the morning and I think we can do some special things in Des Moines because it is a a city you can recruit too when you walk kids a\nMeal of off the plane and then they drive into downtown the they're really impressed with what the city has to offer and then you have the\nThe academic side of it to sell as well and now we've got to do our job on the basketball side of it and I have a brand that people are excited about watching and then enjoy coming to the games and you know that starts with with getting good players that um you know people want to come see\nAny or a veteran Laden team last year again coach you're not there but uh the uh the turnover of the raw string you mentioned it with the number of scholarship players you had when you got there um how do you put this roster together where again you're

I'm not I'm I'm I'm excited that it's becoming relevant and others so excitement surrounding a program\n[noise] yeah and and being in in one of the very biggest media markets in America so therefore the world told me about your relationship with the media because I Know you've always embrace that part of your job\nAnd you love to talk about the kids in the program so has that has that changed is the season when along and now in the summer\nIt's funny you said that room or the um one of the ... when a when I got there everyone told me you know you can't get it done a little it's a pro town to protest right yeah and um I said no it's a sports town\nThey're going to love a blue collar team a team that does things the right way and to watch Chicago embrace us but this is cool though this is part of it\nPretty much I joked about this at the final four um we went through a stop just the fact that you're sitting here talking about I was joking when I was we were playing in the\nFinal four and if that's true it is true this is a funny story especially for media we have a young\n... as a sophomore that works for the oil the Knicks\nHe was our beat writer in so many press conference I'm Talking about twenty games we'd sit there and they put the little a press conference call me up there and they had to Loyola background standing there with a microphone\nAnd I'm looking out now it looks like I'm at a press conference but I'm looking out the one to one word and it ethnic shelter glasses he's asking me summit the final four accord a press conference on a media the media it's a world when it's a press conference like you you took her in the super bowl it goes back and back and back and back and back\nIn all of a sudden standing up he's like Nick ... from\nFrom the whatever Phoenix and he asked me a question about um something that happened during the year like a thing and I said Nick\nYou wouldn't know that because for twenty two games you really only boom in the past that hurts at all to laugh at and what what are the things that was a really good it\nWas a to watch the Chicago media that the Tribune the sun times all the news stations they followed us around everywhere we went and they just love the story of the kind of guys we have so\nYou mean there's a picture of me and her highlights at practice and it's I'm standing there before one of the games like that I think it was a before we went to the sweet sixteen\nAnd it is I'm On the court and sometimes a media person will come to the practicing and dinner due to what it is like ten deep all the way around and uh just cool to see how\nChicago embraced us and I I I look forward to lick the continuing that and um and with with you know obviously there's time demands and all that but that's because we're relevant and that's what you want I Want people to get excited about our story where we came from and where we are going\nCoach there aren't a lot of programs that can have the type of success you did get to the final four and bring back the number of players that you bring back this year how how do you think that will you know maybe speed up the process you guys kind of picking up where you left\nOff you know you can't you can't get to the to the level we got to with one or two players we were seven eight deep you know we we we were good that we lose three those we lose three ... and all Lead Belly player a bed Richardson the defensive player of the year and Andre jak Sussex man of the year I'm so\nIt's time to get real starting tomorrow and be in great shape hopefully being passed the you know the little back issue there for a couple of weeks it's it doesn't mean anything\nIf Jake gambling doesn't come out there and perform tomorrow night and time and time again no matter who you talk to about this club insiders outsiders fans ... riders it doesn't matter it always comes back to the gold tender\nAnd it's going to come back to Jake gallon starting to\nThese comes back to the goal tinder and it's going to come back to Jake gallon starting tomorrow night for the St Louis blues now are you hearing from jak Armstrong a couple of moments ago talking about the great start and then the miserable middle portion of the season\n[noise] this is a club that not used to miss seeing the play offs going back to the can't Hitchcock days this team does didn't miss the play offs and when it happens it sort of jars you and and unfortunately we're starting to get used to missing the playoffs in cardinal land we're not used to it\nWith this blue is called especially when you get eight teams making it out of each conference here's ... go on missing the playoffs last year\nI think everybody more motivated everybody ready more and more and all the time to go to the ... like the golden it off or whether it's going to play in the\nAbsolutely right and with this club it's it's even\nA it's emphasized even more because they've never done it before [noise] and when you miss the playoffs and I think we're all rub the little Raul by that last year and I think Doug Armstrong yeah they are among the best off seasons that we've seen by a general manager in this town\nIn a long long time I kind of go back\nTo that off season we're because it was so critical and it turned out it was just one move but when Mogahed Lance Berkman before the twenty eleven season that that to me might be the last just ban or off season for St Louis general manager where you can look back and even at the time he said one up Berkman really\nIt it was a it was exciting to have a you know switch it or if he's magnitude coming to St Louis [noise]\nUh what what Doug Armstrong has done here I think rivaled that because there were a ton of moves that got done and Alex ... slow obviously not one of those new moves but he sees a lot of new players in this locker room\nRegarded well whether it's a workout area as little wires very for these guys that are around it off her for her to work at a level of their work and I feel like\nYou said skill with she said work ethic and I think there's a there's a hunger it it's not like there was a time I think ... and it's something my keen and did some Twenty years ago you go out and you get\nLike veteran experience guys who knew how to win the Stanley Cup that's all fine and good\nBut usually guys that have won the Stanley Cup or old\nThis missile blues team they got a skill that got young skills they they got guys that are hungry\nAnd that are are ready to contend right now I don't know if you remember that Ethan or a might keen and going out there and just finding all of the uh uh all players that helped Keenan along the way in and tried to ... a match that altogether Stefan motto is the name that rings the most true\nOf those days with my Keenan dishes or group that is young they are athletic and I I think again among the most dynamic group of forwards that we've ever seen that we've seen in a while in a blue uniform\nRemember that ... that you're talking about but I remember the guards on first took over he signed Jamie laying and Bernard and Jason are now who are well past their prime by then and they didn't really offer very much\nYeah ... it's and I get it and I understand why guys do it it's almost as if you do it because you feel like it's like the final piece of the puzzle that's different you go out and get guided deadline that you feel I can put you over the top that want to cut before that's not what you'd do in\nJuly and August in June when you're putting the team together you're putting together that core that foundation\nOr not the funny thing is that we'll probably talk about it in the seven o'clock hour uh I'm not sure how much room to blues are going to have to make it any more moves\nBy the time you get into the into the regular season a not a lot of room under the salary cap right now for the note but a lot happening today Jim Thomas will be in Studio with
