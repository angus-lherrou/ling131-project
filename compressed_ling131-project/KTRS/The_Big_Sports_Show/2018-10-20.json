'cause that was last march I did I get up a homecoming I think I think most of these guys get a steak 'n anybody saying they admitted it and it is a fun time you have a lot of friends that are coming back\nUm there's that that just that energy around campus you see the parades you see the house decorations you see the you know the the older folks showing up the town trying to show the young kids how they could still uh\nThey can still get down usually doesn't end well for them when they try to go out and do that but yet they come back every year and give it a run and it is a fun time even more fun when you\nAre able to get a football when and his team badly needs one\nUsually schedule Patsy for homecoming get guaranteed when it it's it's an opponent of the American Memphis\nBut they're the ninth highest scoring team in the country forty three point nine points per game in off the bench that can absolute we moved to change so ah maybe at\nThe start of the euro especially with Memphis turning over the uh the quarterback range new QB this year with a with Ferguson having moved on\nBut it's still an off and that when it's right is as dangerous as ... as anybody so I ... at least if we're being real here it no it's not damage not Georgia but you don't really have a chance to catch your breath with the Memphis Tigers you know\nYeah you're a loser excellent points and the fact that as a micro relatives or what third year I Believe and I think he has\nFive wins against power five teams which is pretty good and when you look down the line they'd been new double figures here the last ever since she's been on board so you know you you don't\nI I guess I grew up thinking Memphis hoops you know it just\nOf on a metal or not to get into these days now depending already exactly\nEarlier Vatican two of these days not offending our enemies than I Am a\n... but uh you know you look at a team that takes a an unbeatable team a central Florida last weekend and and they're up thirty Seventeen at halftime and so the Memphis ... really should have a lot but he just shut off the second half and they lose thirty one thirty\nAnd so unfortunately and a central Florida is certainly got a good team and um\nI I think these are these ... tigers are where when you go and in your team notes you have a pick of Gerald ... you know and he he leads and you know a boatload of office of categories\nOf for a deal on schools um he he can be a load 'em and and plus as you to get out of their office who will they average over forty points a game so [noise] uh it'll be tough tomorrow\nAnd instead of you know the the a C ... a a league that was ... again there and one of the group of five leagues bought because of central Florida last year end this year South Florida under Charlie Strong and this is a league that's got a push because\nThey're the prince fun brand a football and they got some legitimately good teams that as being like you said Jim beat in power five schools banned so this is this is it's not the sun belt this isn't the Mac them this this is as close as you get close as you get to being a power five school without being of our five school\nAbsolutely and and I would also point out they've got a heck of a coach in my ... I mean this could have been a a slip and slide after Wednesday left and it wasn't like the ... come in they're taking them to to ball games in two seasons they've got he's got Eighteen wins\nInto both parents under his belt entering\nThis game and a loaded I mean a loaded office it's not just Darryl Henderson either Brady White he has been one of the most efficient pastors\nIn the country they're putting up massive points they can ah they're they're gonna predicated author run game which I think works in Missouri's favor but it's not just sterile Henderson I mean this game if Missouri defense doesn't come to play\nThis has you know middle Tennessee potential written all over it and there's nothing worse than losing a homecoming game to it to a um you know to a non conference opponent it is the\nAnd I've heard people say I wish he'd better than high pulls off at school of course he was he had a couple of years to learn under it to to be shocked\nThat oh this ... this may not be as good as Josh ... often swell up get of course well the ... and and and and maybe a week for now a month from now it's going to be better I expected will be but uh I I think we all probably had some uh\nUnrealistic expectations that it would just be this scene was ... it's\n... I was one of the few people who didn't it wasn't\nYou know you're right you're right about that guy never play your or\nEver ever and you put\nThem in the X rays lay on and not that's not necessarily knock on barrel but what are you going to be any names\nTo they're going to be some there's going to be some ups and downs has never call plays before um he's not like you say he was like a quarterback whisper that was not something that was his skill said he was ... ... um the fair to ask with the mother receiving play they've gotten while you're not seeing more of that\nGets hurt now everybody else's you know no one else has kind of stepped into the void I'm here to talk about talk a lot about needing to recruit better I haven't heard a lot of talk about I Need to make these receivers that are on this team better I'm a senior you're tied into I thought was going to get drafted next year to me take a step back I don't know that Alberto\nIs screaming to me and I felt draft prospect right now so I think there's some things offensively but I think it's fair to mention to hear\nMy biggest question about this team is still the defense um ... well the the thing the office was supposed to do this season was to give the defense of better chance to be good\nAnd when you look at the time of possession that has improved there were one of the worse than the league last words in the country last year in possession now they're about middle of the pack what does the defense had to show for it nothing hope they're okay against Iran game they're getting towards the one of the worst passing defenses in the country\nAnd I don't see how it's going to improve maybe they're going to play some worst team that's the only way that the passing numbers are going to get better because they can't get consistent pressure on the quarterback and I can't cover anybody so the office has done some things to make things better for the deepest of the defense is let the office down\nIn front of synch him older Brennan we see its kickoff cats make five Fifteen when we come back to head coach or a tiger is very old I'm joined us here in the big five fifty\nStory it's called the ugly truth about timeshare reach that given down your family fiber about buying a timeshare you need my\nHelp hello I'm Chuck McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping folks canceled our timeshare contracts and and that process started what's now called the Tom shirt cancellation industry\nTom ... the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end what are you my timeshare you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they won't for angle maintenance and assessment phase sound crazy\nCrazy thing is this never ends\nIt's an assessment phase sound crazy crazy thing is this never ends even when you die your families now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to stay calm office now I guarantee if we can't answer your chapter ... you'll pay nothing\nCall for your free information get eight hundred six nine one Ninety nine Ninety nine that's eight hundred six nine Ninety nine Ninety nine eight hundred six nine one Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDays John Candy for Alan roofing and boy they have grown by leaps and bounds brand new show room breathtaking place not analysis ill and they're still taking care of everybody's roofing siding and got her needs to\nTheir location Janelle is still Missouri you'll find them in St Peter's Andean Casey bill Illinois\nDoing your homework since Nineteen Seventy two signed them on line at a roofing dot net that's Allan real\nThings take your debt beyond ordinary ... products from decorators from post caps and lighting to ... to composite ducking\nDecorators offered the products you need to bring interior design to your outdoor living space all backed by extraordinary warranties including their industry leading twenty five years structural twenty\nFive years Spain and face and twenty five year removing replacement limited warranty minded dealer decorators dot com that's decorators with a K go beyond ordinary\nYou will fall in St Louis meaningful hunting season and our ... once you can play this long to have a whole money blind and tell us more than say\nThe purchase of any hard side box by undersea the free money cheer in prison never a bad time to visit our GDP in valley ...\nAnd you know they've got the best and the most and yet he anywhere else in three to five and three hundred asking are you the expert about their special this fall visit our duty and the only part I guarantee you leave ready to play\nSeasons are place for everything [noise] the big five fifty K.

thanks for having me on and on and I hope everyone has a great week we're looking forward to having an opportunity to play at home on coming game against\nA really good opponent in Memphis and our kids are excited about it I'm excited about having the opportunity to play a pro and it's supposed to be weather wise that outstanding a fall afternoon and and uh we're we're looking forward to having a great week of preparation and and go player ...\n... coach I'm sure it's going to be great to finally have some fall weather for football this weekend a you know looking back\nCoach this past Saturday a in Tuscaloosa your team and opportunity to play number one I'm your team doesn't come out on top of what what kind of lessons were you and and your team able to take away from playing the Crimson Tide\nAnd the number one give them credit they're number one for a reason and you get to see it in a up close and personal they're they're good in every area [noise]\nUm I thought you know if you look at it two or three times after the after the game's over after the fact on on the always take lessons on the experiences that of of things you learn and and apply moving forward\nUm there were ... times the games Thirteen to ten\nWe talked about wanting to get out to a fast start uh you got to eliminate big plays explosive plays on defense and not turn them all on our fence we didn't do those two things we turned it over and we gave up\nYour shot early on um I thought our team continue to battle I thought we played physical\nI'm not I'm not saying we won the physical battlefield from start to finish but I thought that\nUm you know that we we stood in there and continue to to battle back and forth and they're they're a a really really really good football team and I would suggest the [noise] the best that that I've ever seen in person and you know I'm I'm I'm starting to talk [laughter] um I have I have\nA lot of success moving forward but also know that our our team and then there's the the the facts are we are in and look at what we've got the opportunity is Romanian\nStrict streams and were three and three we lost number one for the last number two and then we lost a tossup game [noise]\nI'm In South Carolina would be really really good Purdue team and we've got an opportunity for will take care of business prepare the right way and then go execute and continue to work together like we have looked at this point we've got a chance to to be right where we need to be\nYou mentioned Purdue coach they won three in a row since ... three so you're absolutely right\nAbout what the boiler makers have done um you know what you mentioned the quick strike Alabama has against you guys to start and then you eat your team really did respond I'm sure you can I'm sure there's plenty of things you can look back on it and and and try to find ways to improve but that was a spot I thought you\nWere an a you know other teams may have sort of crumbled under the pressure I thought you guys really bounce back what would you see there after that initial Alabama score and then the response by your kids\nWell I thought you know overall defensively you know and in some of the situation as they were put down from from turnovers or things like that backs against the law thought that responded pretty well now the\nI'm giving up a sixty or Seventy or touchdown pass when when you you really you kinda know what's coming um that's that's not good but there was a point in in a couple of situations or other night where they were just better than us then and that's hard to say and admit out loud at times but\nYou know I'm also a realistic on\nA similar situations that we're in and and and the outcome of it now that doesn't change anything on\nThe way we're prepare the way you go to eat and the expectation level you know a of going into a competitive arena and and walking out with when that's the that's the end of the day that's the story on what we want what we're looking for so uh we're gonna continue to work on on all those things the fundamentals of planet clay and efficient football game\nBut also having a chance to uh go cut loose and and go play and and are are are kids are excited again about having a chance to play at home and get back in and let's get back at it\nThey're all ... mine rushes of forty or more yards loving plays a forty plus yards um you know in other words he gets to the corner you be looking at is back\nIn ... this is again one and this and this was a game Jim where you turned back there I don't know how often will call his name or my Kelly will call his name on Saturday but it is incumbent upon that defensive line to get an enormous push\nTo where okay if if if the bee Jay's on making the tackle and one of those linebackers have to be an ... to allow that to happen they've got to get into that backfield push that Memphis off and some line back because if you're going to have a chance\nAt containing Henderson you've got to blow up that often supplied to start\nYeah big game for the line backers you've got to be playing downhill you got to be you have to be making sound tackles 'cause if you try to arm tackled this young man he's going to be gone and uh and and they're gonna they're gonna try to establish the run I mean to me it sounds it almost makes you sick to your stomach to say that Missouri to make a team beat them through the air\nUm because of how bad the best defenses but if there is a team that they play where you feel like that's what they have\nTo do this was the one you know it today I had heard an individual talking about it was a former coach and talking about the secondary talking about the line linebackers alignment\nAssignment than tackled the three things and it's just it's right there alignment make sure you know that these guys are being put it in the right spot right and then carrying out your assignment\nAnd finishing the tackle make it look tackle and it was it sounds pretty simple but that's a that's the way it should be and we certainly haven't seen that\nIn the second with a wide open spots but it's still so makes me sick about the south Carolina game you know the twenty seven yards to the ... uh to set up three game winning feel go\nGuys are second number two\nAnd that's the number of October wins so far for Barry owed them in his tenure at the zoo and those two that came in ... Idaho and Yukon last year and a force that it did start the run of consecutive wins November was fantastic berries November record 'em in looks a little better but\nUh it it it does sort of under score a how difficult to spin and one of those October losses was the middle Tennessee homecoming lost a couple of years ago this is a ... this is the time now for\nFor this football program to turn it around and it's you know and berries call that a turnaround that uh it it it it it's got to happen it's gotta happen right here and we we alluded to it a little bit earlier\nIt's it's got to start now against the team that uh again that the odds makers day you should beat\nThe on the line we'll talk about that a little bit later the wind is about eight or nine points this is a game you should be done I wouldn't I wouldn't say comfortably ... but um I\nI think they're gonna they're gonna have to find a way to do it and uh the the jumping off point now for the second turnaround form a zoo the second year in a row uh ... this this is where it has to start\nYeah I mean you're talking about a very grim season if he loses came on\nSaturday to Memphis um and that's not take anything away from Memphis but playing at home homecoming against a a non conference opponent these are the games that are that can be the start of something or they can be\nThe uh you know the the game that starts at the beginning of the ... here I don't think that's being too dramatic um that we all looked at this game\nAs the point where ... could and should go on a street um we looked at that this off season we said look they're going to bed when they're on conference games\nAnd I got to go through a three game ringer here\nWould be a big big boost that they could get a win against South Carolina\nBut then once you get to Memphis and after that you got to roll and uh nothing's changed um guy when you're on ... this is the last one and a and and no matter what you know Missouri team in the in its third year on her head coach should have enough talent and enough pure\nAdvantage and skill that they should be able to beat him beat this Memphis football team so if if you can't and you have to ask yourself a here Jim start why is why is nor bell and your three better at Memphis the my coaches and your three that's a that's a blunt way of putting it but it's a completely fair way of putting it\nAnd I hope I hope you know for the sake of the fans are for the student athletes the that they feel for all\nAnd on Saturday under don't tomorrow afternoon because\nUh it it means a lot obviously to the staff to to various F. and and the players or whatever the case that should that should be able to they should be able to get that down and you know I kind of look at this\nThe only they're at home tomorrow when they went to South Carolina everybody was saying well you know what you know the uh Vegas was kind of looking at this was kind of pick 'em tight game will this game they have Missouri ... by about eight point jump to take care of business boys no question\nAbout it and I just wanted October games winning the home games for burial to alter important as well inside the numbers here as we continue on kickoff got done when we come back\nInside the numbers here as we continue on kick off guard when we come back Jim holder has his uh a lot on the interview it's a sister still Bradley on the other side of this break in the big five fifty\nTo link Saturday October twenty that Arnold golf club for the two thousand Eighteen Arnold golf classic and help support strong family ...

Williams was there a but then other than that really hadn't done much had gone through some coaches that\nJust couldn't get things right and then it wasn't until justice one came along and the tigers were able to you know some good recruiting for a really good coaching and in fact on the map and\nUm you got to the American athletic conference championship game last year so it's pretty incredible the support for the tigers and it's written pretty incredible watch over the last\nYou know how long have I been in Memphis sixteen years you know that that first time that they went through a ball game\nWith the Angela Williams was you know first time I've been to a ball game and over Thirty years and people were really excited about it but that makes it kinda went back to their tires were still the same old tigers and now\nWe're talking about tiger football in the summer um there's there's a passion for a third excitement about it and then the patient for each season\nThat's grown where people are talking soccer football in the summer which they've never had before so let's sports men were really good so far so good now leaving a couple of games in bringing the conference people are so disappointed that the Congress actually three lots of the season will be very sexy war\nRob in Memphis\nA good sports city\nReally good sport I think if you look\nYou look at television ratings\nFor just about any sporting events and you're going to find in Memphis topped three top five almost every time\nEspecially if it's college football especially if it's envy you will find them\nAre even and I fell football for that matter for non NFL cities\nWill be among the top in Birmingham seem to always be two of the city as far as the rankings are concerned so yeah I think I think it's a great city if they don't feel part\nOf the law\nIf they don't feel part\nOf the love of basketball\nIs you know kind of hard to wait for the last week you grow up just knowing the game if you live in Memphis so that's a real big basketball city but football is work there about whether it's SCC and spent the tigers are the NFL\nIf our city and you know and they love all their sport so they they love baseball the people will watch that people watch all star game ... playoff somebody at a lot of cargo fans that are here to the red birds of course are here so yeah it's a it's a it's a really good sports town and it's a really knowledgeable sports as well\nFrom Fisher is with us on the kickoff confidential going behind enemy lines looking at this Memphis tiger team for\nSaturday afternoon homecoming actors do Rob you mentioned the three losses from Memphis is the most recent coming in central Florida on beaten and of course they lay claim to or at least a piece of the national championship last year so it was a huge game this past weekend in Memphis and they fall\nAnd just to point shore and it was an incredible football game a little little rain there at times the conditions were a little crazy I Do get a sense that uh that the team feels a little deflated coming off limits what had to be circled as their biggest game of the year\nAbsolutely there to play you know I mean very disappointed and then to have the first top that they had against UCF where they fast food dominated the book I mean they had the game and control\nSo that's a again we don't expect to be very close but again the should be close\nDeath Valley again LSU in Mississippi State by your Bengals by six and a half the odds makers say Ben you've been on LSU fad phase in coach owes team\nOr they bounced back after the last the Florida and and beating the Georgia Bulldogs ... and ... and just being in Georgia, Georgia which fourth quarter dawn game was over\nIn the fourth quarter down in LA ask you this is another big one though because Mississippi State um leveled off a little bit after the fast start but still obviously that's under a touchstone spread this should be a pretty big dean but suddenly now LSU can have legitimate hopes of\nYou know plain Alabama here and a few weeks with with a chance to to actually their name in the in the playoff race yeah I'm\nI'm sticking with coach Joe you had me a doubting myself a little bit and look and they came out and delivered in a in a very big game against Georgia and that man that um is it okay to be impressed by us you but also disappointed in Georgia\nYesterday and I started Georgia was just eliminate or Jewish tests on the other there was a tough on dogs and it shows you that that LSU got something going there may be George is not quite as untouchable as it as it has looked at other points this season but uh I think I think coach oh is I\nThink had better coaching gets credit for I mean he's keeps goofy he sounds funny and people like to me for all accent and he gets all the kids fired up to play and they'll run through a wall forum and I think that's showing\nYou know I I don't think there's a there's any any doubt about to LSU on on Saturday but especially at home you know you get that you get that game at home I'm On a Saturday Night or in Baton Rouge shoes it's it'll\nBe big now Mississippi State can put up some points but I I think this was another year where you have somebody behind Alabama\nThat might be ready to maybe take take kind of a shot like ANL money yet Johnny uh\nQuarterbacking and he goes to the Tuscaloosa wins again or ... but the um\n[noise] um right\nNow it's it's yellow shoo shoo steps below Alabama but uh and I think they'll take care of the dogs on Saturday Night\nInteresting game here well at least in terms of the wind to me right now is Andrew build that Kentucky started eleven and a half it's come down a little bit it's a Kentucky by eleven right now and some of the action would would leaning lead me to believe some of the professional gamblers out there like to Vanderbilt I'm\n... I I Want to see Kentucky come out there and bludgeon Vanderbilt is Kentucky\nIs this real threat in the SEC east or because you you can I think it's fair to argue has Kentucky Pete yet [noise] uh and I think this kind of gives us a little bit of a barometer as to where the Wildcats are at they should win but I'm interested in seeing how\nBig they went against Randy yeah I I like Kentucky to cover in this game either coming off a by week they have one last five in one that was that a and M. and overtime twenty to fourteen um that's a good football team so they've had to buy we just do over that loss um I ... I\nA good football team so they've had to buy we just do over that loss\nUm I ... I still behind Kentucky all season I didn't get off of them after no after they lost that at a un and that was a hard fought game I think they look good meanwhile you have Vanderbilt\nComing off back to back law says they don't have the ... they played Georgia and Florida I mean they're beat up they are so I think Kentucky is going to I think Kentucky's gonna role in that game\nUh Kentucky as a temp best overall defense a was a big schools and and guess what and they play of physical brand and unfortunately form a zoonotic tomorrow homecoming Memphis\nMan a Kentucky you know at home plate and dandy and then of course Missouri gets Kentucky\nUnfortunately they they come to Columbia but I'll tell you what\nTheir that starts a\nNot how do you say it is it an murderers roll well not really but\nKentucky Florida they're doing a whole lot better to have you know they'll have Georgia before they come and play a Missouri and then a baddie and intimacy and in Arkansas in and of course tomorrow's game will be the the last six\nInteresting if I'm Kentucky I'm watching how Missouri plays Memphis because they've got running back and bending Snell who's comparable to understand so you can't stop Darryl ... than the Kentucky I'm watching a much that film going how can we free Benny Snell against these guys\nAre burning old miss this one of the first games on the Saturday slate Adel miss opera singer ... barely the guts boss could be permanently docked if\nThey lose people every year every year we turn now every year in every in every year I come back and win and now the Auburn roll again\nBut if he loses if he loses he's in trouble\nYeah I was yeah and I remember last year when it when he was gonna get ran off an an Arkansas was going to hire him and they ended up giving them the monster extension yeah okay let's all just every time every every guest seems to be teetering ... figure is a way to save his saved his rear\nEnd it was two years ago that game against less miles of LSU where it almost seems like a loser leaves town match at Auburn what analysts miles got fired all your writing\nGossip is stuck around he survived but this would not go over well after losing it home to Tennessee losing to an old miss team that hasn't been able to stop anybody\nI mean they can't stop anyway but they can pass some oil yeah they can only do they can no question about it and had to play defense it'd be pretty good huh [laughter]\nSo the ... or early ... game on Saturday fellows Michigan Michigan State it's in east east East Lansing\nI'm I'm really on the machine bandwagon right now and this is going to tell me a lot because this is a rivalry game ... of course Michigan's always been the big brother Michigan State little brother at Michigan State has owned this rivalry a little more lately\nI think Michigan wins it tells me a lot if Michigan goes in there and brothels Michigan State they throttle party look out ... I think Michigan might be not only the team to beat and the Big Ten but they may legit bi national title contender ... I think as his best team in Ann Arbor\nWe are all Spartans on Saturdays boys all no question about is right here I Am coach khaki do for a uh come up that's again he gets on every like three weeks ago in three games a lot of a sudden you the best coach in the country do you go by the time for some humble pie in Ann Arbor\nOne more in the Big Ten is Ohio State Purdue Saturday Night David blah and the boilers they've won three in a row but guys are still favored fly to touchdowns does it does this game and treat you at all or the buckeyes role\nIn the book as well but but ... but at some point ma'am David Blau I mean he he needs to stay in Missouri up an edible basket and he was the opening to David ... experience in West Lafayette I mean he would kick him out of a shell against the tigers and he has a look back since no question about it Ohio\nState they go in and they won the big game in happy valley a couple of weeks ago you know the all white out all this that the other uh\nThey'll take care of business I think so too us Lafayette I think they've survived they're tracking last week against the very story Minnesota teen when they go for student at all the way but I still when they uh they should be able movable fairly easily or do you ... yeah\nForty six to seven love he's in trouble right boy love he's got to be in trouble as you're not that beard he's trying to go into the witness protection program\nWe are your levy [laughter] fried or to the gym older brand and we've seen with the hard Richards joins us after the break here on kicked off countdown\nLiberty mutual insurance knows your focusing on the road right now so we'll just describe the advertisement we may hold you\nThere she is the statue of liberty printed on a premium sheet of paper that message reads liberty mutual customize your auto insurance so you only pay for what you need you'll think wow this is top notch marketing that makes me want to reconsider my insurance provider\nGo to liberty mutual dot com for uh customize quoting you could save coverages underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company that that we ...\nHi this is Stuart Rosenberg I'm president of tourists American mortgage hilly workers are the biggest investment that a person's gonna make in their life\nYet most people don't know anything about it for mortgages and more which doing that to me where we can go all the different types of mortgage programs in simple terms of you and me here really become an extra hour after the first show listened to mortgages it more ... at its new time Sunday mornings at nine AM on K T.
