I don't remember who told me but I've never noticed that but you know the Blackhawks don't\nHardly play any Saturday Night games for their entire ... at home in Chicago really and I guess it's because they did kind of reserved for a Michael Jordan and the bulls even though Michael Jordan really for the balls or\nTwenty years uh you know the United center I guess the bulls get first if somebody like I ... I ... I couldn't believe it was like three or four maybe even less than that Saturday Night games at the Blackhawks get for the entire season that's unbelievable\nIt is and I can always remember growing up to ... that Saturday Night blues home game it was an event and it's it's still it's still kind of at an event last year the blues that only like a partly because of some scheduling ah ah you always have the the the valley in there but uh what else was in there wasn't there another was it wrestling what else we don't see see that's the\nLast year or is that what was then a ... a year or two springs from now we'll have the NC double a first round a there are a rise scenario\nThat's always good but the the blues requests recruit requested more home games it wasn't just a matter of that other events in there but the the league for whatever reason just in grab amounts a grant up now this year a lot more I think the blues might have\nTwelve eleven or twelve Saturday Night games including this one with the uh with the hawks\nIt's it's certainly valuable real estate there's no doubt about it and you know before we go to break to you know this ... deal it's more than ... years since he's a well it's I mean what he didn't even students step on the ice at all last years you know how about a guy that has been played meaningful hockey JT in two years and regular\nSeason game it was like my ... was Mike Yo Yo's first game when he took over for Hitchcock was it would have been February of two thousand Seventeen it gets hurt\nYou always joking about that you know talking about how we're we're asking about how anxious fabric wasn't he has been he feels good he feels maybe beyond good he feels great and he's chomping at the bit to get out there and\nYou said how I should say matter I've only had him for one game now he was he was in a one preseason game last year and to pre season games this year but yeah as far as regular season it has been a minute as the kids say\nAnd I I'm just curious to see\nWhat what do you do what ever at least eighty it it it helps it helps your depth out a little bit oh yeah and I I think with anything else is going to be really curious to see what he can do and where he's at physically run if he even\nComes close resembling the player ah we thought we might see color will\nEver get it back after every major or a knee surgeries and and the thing it earlier in camp he he was not having issues with the knee but\nMaybe because he was over compensating or whatever\nE but maybe\nBecause he was over compensating or whatever he he he had a sore back after one game he had to ship and and a growing issues and and I just think the thing it's one thing to\nBe in practice and being hockey shape to that respect but out in the game as just a whole different deal when you're you're playing a game and so that's why it took a little longer and I think you make a valid point\nWho knows what to expect from ... will we get it back for all he's got to be rushed to for a while and that's why I think uh you know maybe two or three conditioning games maybe start 'em out on the fourth line here and just say you're just going to play eight nine minutes\nYou know the blues have enough steps on their on their a top three lines right now and you know what if you're a little sore after one game it gets to the game or two they they really want to maybe by mid season or the end of the season that's you know the assumption there was that they'd be in the height of the playoffs at that point you know who knows if that's going to be the case now but\nBut by by the end of you know having just\nJust all all the way back by the end to an end of the season I mean they they they're they're taking a very patient approach with him this time I think last year I think and again I was brand spanking new one of the I think maybe just the time between the surgery when he came back I was a little bit of a rush\nJumped out of somebody we see blues you're on the big five fifty K.

phenomenal golf coming after him and and the teachers to another level Bob and the day before\nOn a par five he had three hundred yards the green energy and his caddy we're talking about well I mean first of all everybody in their right mind taking three would put it up by the green tea is deciding whether Cory ... was too much from where you have this as a whole different\nThing I mean I you know I think the fact that he doubted Bob ... in the mix in the ... for George these the ... the guy says the Jay and Jay's on and on and on with guys guys it it's very impressive\nHe he seems to have a I don't know he's like the X factor to\nMe you watch him play a\nAnd then you know at least for me and I'm just speaking personally maybe listening to the groomer feel differently about him but I

day\nOr that their tour card and and their first help was let me keep that thing because it's so golden and this is a different attitude from these younger players it's about winning it's about achieving as much as you can laugh about just making cuts in learning\nAt such a great point I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because I distinctly remember being in that environment\nOf fires or a you know new to the PGA Tour a sure maybe Ninety percent of the conversation was about keeping the card a ten percent of the conversation was about winning now\nI I think maybe a foot completely around and uh these young guys that come out with a brace in December or or whatever it's Ninety percent of our winning then I think about keeping the card you know if they win they will be keeping that court\nI don't want to sound like a old fogy because I'm not but I mean you know these younger players had no idea about uh how different\nThe money situation was\nHow different Lee a grimy situation

viewer foundation and and what you are attempting to do in the north Florida area\nThanks Bob uh sure well we found a semi foundation is growing and we have a\nCouple a couple of pillars I call them or that kind of find my foundation electronically foundation raises money first of all for the for the north Florida and we've been doing that for ... thousand\nWe've raised over ... three hundred thousand dollars for the first year north Florida and foundation started that we're really proud of that and we do that by various Gulf of it that we put on 'em\nAnd we kind of cleaned up every ... years and they could crash and uh to create that it would hurt the\nRaise money and winning organization so I'm as well we just started this year ...\nWe're in Vacaville and when I brought that idea to the dark county school or to do all county um they really embrace that they really love the idea because even though they they like knowledge that they do that programs in the school that address but\nNot enough things out on the problem is growing on the whole issue with the family or community and they want to be\nIn effect it would affect family sort of the community and they want to be more sell hats off to do a county school board to we want you know to raise this issue\nAnd bring it to the to the wrong way in school so in schools and after school so they're partnering with my foundation and we're excited about it so we're going to be in all the schools and Duval county\nFor going to be an after school programs like the boys and Girls Club or a an organization called communities in the schools\nWhich keeps the kids after school in the schools\nAnd has about a two or three hour program for the kids that they cover their homework they cover meals they cover\nA activities and the cover issues and then one of the issues\nIs is Dr bowling campaign [laughter] with the first in North Florida involvement with stop the bowling campaign my foundation he now has become centered around kids in Jacksonville and or the development of a new\nUh to protect them from violence keeps adding a developing healthy habits and we're really proud of everything we're doing\nWe're speaking with my teeth in part of a prominent as a bully get away with it because\nThe kids they bully don't want to share their with their parents or share with anybody I Do my embarrassment about the fact that they were bullied show makes it easier for bullies and mine bright\nI Would say that a lot of parents are doing great things with their kids that the kids don't we share\nThis type of behavior this type of treatment with the parents because in a may not be cool you know they may be embarrassed they may feel bad they may feel like their parents might jump over board so they don't say anything and I can tell you with with my with my family\nA that was the case and not to get into personal stuff but\nUm I find out with a lot of kids and families that you're right they don't share that stuff and they just trying to keep to themselves you know and then\nGetting faster you know and then um you know for whatever age kids whether it's eight years old twelve years old sixteen years old\nThey keep it to themselves and it's not it's not good because uh nothing's nothing's done about it a lot of times the problems\nAre multiply they get worse and you know no kid no no clear to any age deserves that type of treatment so a lot of times the kids don't report it whether to the school or to their parents\nAnd the behavior continues to bully feel like they're you know they're not getting the accountability to them so they just keep doing the behavior and I'm the king and they and the kids who are receiving that\nYou know they they don't deserve it and then it just kind of like this perpetual behavior and that's what we're trying to do with trying to change the mindset or trying to change their mind set here in Jacksonville\nThat it's not cool not cool at all to do that and we're not really we're not really going after the bully the actual bully what we're doing is we're acknowledging the behavior with talking about why it's bad\nInto the media they\nAll play video games all day or do we like to repeat those kind of peace has apologized\nBacon really be\nAble to come back to the second for you if you had the you look at like he's not
