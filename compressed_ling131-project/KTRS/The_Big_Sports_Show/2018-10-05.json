Will Shortz by the time but also what it does is it just the increased competition of raises the homeless levels because I think\nUm I I mean the cubs level whether it's called it's Fisher\nI'm obviously drives the plays the same phone back to 'em because they know that if they don't perform and said it'll cost level the chances are they going to be out with St ... guys because if somebody ready of what is that good stuff so that should be made huge difference um adults that hopefully we can\nWith the ball he's a\nQuick that healthy quickly and unable to help us with his final push\nCoach it it it really seems like a ... a ... things for you guys in ... she recently ... explain from your vantage point his level of play\nIs an excellent ... suffering from\nWhen you when the ... with a ... and it was live up to the major surgery in Rome agents that we just got off the street here to ... and then I kind of ... um again was was it difficult balancing act um\nAs to when we gave him the opportunity to come back here and I'm a I think he was ... it probably is ... I'm a ... which was to be expected at one of the Congress ...\nTo ... number of weeks and then it got to stage a fruitful which part of a hill because as a coach just off we we felt like we have to almost go with what a little outlets\nAnd they've got their work cut out and they have a little none of not work cut out we have a little bit of work to do uh I think uh you know I Know we'll talk about Phoenix you're even more but\nUh the result feeling night I'm almost say is unexpected are expected but we knew that it could happen the results are you in San Antonio makes it palatable and uh and now we've got to get some points in these next two games again but we still control our own destiny\nWhen you when you learn in particular from that Phoenix match Dale it's it's on the road it's anything on the road I I think you know you're you're taking your chances what did you and and we knew Phoenix among the best teams in the west we are going to be tough\nWell you know we talk first off to Moscow masses inform let such huge uh he was very very good made three or four outstanding saves\nUm we also found out that we couldn't press Phoenix uh we you know we have talked about how we had been a good pressing team a team that can play up temple or make teams play faster than they want and this is the first time in a while the we got pushed back into her own half of the field\nNow is it a change of systems that will need to do if we get to play Phoenix again or\nOr was adjusted Phoenix was sharp on the on the night and the addition of ... just added a little bit more to\nTo their arsenal I'm so ... it's a ... a little bit of of of something that Anthony and the staff can look at it on video try to figure out how they can play a little bit more in the front of the field and what we did in a in the Phoenix game\nWhen when you say that and you know the the strategy that we've seen the depressing style and an aunt has a way of of being able to adjust and really play for the opponent\nHow do these next two games shape Bob Ford the type of strategy you think he's gonna want to employ\nI think the Tulsa game it fits really well I think that they you know they don't have an excess amount of speed in front of half of the field or in their front for players are so we can we can press up against some without being overly concerned about the space behind is ... is one of the ... there are wide players has a has a bit of pace\nBut for the most part they're a knock it around team tried to get to the front half the field combine and create chances\nSo we can press them uh and I think is probably in our best interest to really knowing where we are with the table and the need to get four points into games this is a game I think we really want to come in and and influence the temple\nA okay see and the other hand has some pace you know Christian ... is one of the faster ... played here for a year and a half\nA he's got a lot of pace in and they've got a they've got some guys that can get up and down the field um so that's a you know I think learning\nAs I can get up and down the field um so that's a you know I think learning a bit from Phoenix will help us a dictate how we're gonna play again so Casey\nSo we talked about it a little bit on Sunday mornings for Sunday here in the big five fifty Katie are asking you have been talking about the formula the number of points that magic number if you will not completely like baseball is that in a limitation number but you gave us a keen number fifty three points\nIt's fluctuated a little bit from time to time and that's sort of gone with the way some of these other teams have gone but Dale let's do some math here\nAs we look ahead and look at what's San Antonio still has left in front of them to matches winnable matches against Vegas and our GV and St Louis\nAgainst Tulsa and okay CDO glove homeless swing luckily those Oklahoma teams coming through St Louis give me a scenario let let's let's start with the bad gives me a scenario where St Louis does not make it\n[noise] well [noise] they're going to make it but [laughter] but you want to cause that if I Would I be sure if it was still in the mix so what what is what is the let's start with a worst case scenario is off San Antonio has to win out\nRight and and do our GV is playing much better now than they were earlier in the year there in the bottom half of the table because of their start um so our GV Las Vegas San Antonio when both of those games at home they end up with fifty two points\nThe most agonizing result would be for us to get a win\nWhich brings all sort of fifty two points but not get that extra point in a draw would you leave us both on fifty two and would leave a San Antonio with one more wind than us\nIf that happens then that's the first high breaker that's the first\n... the ah the result would go to a or the the tide burger we'd go to San Antonio and they would they would get a playoff spot\nSt Louis cannot clinch though this weekend San Antonio does play Saturday Night with the law St Louis would not quite be able to Colin clinch\nNot Clinton but boy what sure it would sure make things a lot a lot easier\nIf San Antonio loses Saturday St Louis can college where the next Wednesday night\nThat struck a or even a draw if\nSeen it tells you write in San Antonio loses on Saturday and they're sitting on forty six points and we're sitting on forty nine it just takes a a draw in one of your last two games to put you to fifty San Antonio must win out I mean there's\nA there is as sure we could lose both they could lose both I Know they couldn't lose well they would win one and lose one and then they would go through on wins if I'm not mistaken about diluted that scenario um but uh I lost by San Antonio all but puts us into the into the play off from\n\nWhat about the spot they're going to occupy Dale\nSwipe Reno ... at at at at this moment swap is I'm a point ahead Reno comes in a few points ahead do you still think there is an opportunity for St Louis to move up the table from eight\nThat's a good question I Would say\nKnowing that ... has a game away at Sacramento or will it looks like we'll be six seven eight more likely seven or eight at the state I mean you you\nCould have snuck away what the point here or an extra point there and he moved up but I think at this stage we're seven or ...\nThe last in Phoenix hurt their chances are you're moving up\nYet of moving up but not in my mind obviously it hurt your chances of getting into the play off but you you had to expect one figuring um the total points at the end of the year that that would have been a tough one a Phoenix result in Phoenix would have been a difficult point or three points to get\nThe Knicks is good and and we mentioned it they're there in second place right now in the western conference this this period where they get a week and a half off what what do you think they work on in particular to ah to get ready how how how beneficial can this be\nCould have been even longer had they had that gained gone through this would have been a a two week strand yeah without a match what\nKen this week and a half and do a to get them ready for those final two man I think the first\nThing is that it allows it can allow wall fall to get healthy or you know he he got pulled into fifty third minute um we need him desperately to be healthy so get him healthy number one number to\nRecharge the batteries a little bit let the guys get a day or two off our aunts who wants to do that whether it's two days in succession or a couple of days what day here in the day there however wants to to handle that\nAnd then I think really it's it's just a matter of maintaining sharpness I don't think that you start to implement new plans a new ideas in for these final two games uh I don't know Anthony that well but the time that we spent together on the radio all the time I spent with him alone at the at the soccer park\nTells me that he's a guy that that lays the groundwork early um talks to the players about the importance of each game as a game as part of a season not a special game where players have to be\nUp for individual games he'll he'll have the guys prepared as they would for the second game of the year or the twelfth game of the year at a thirtieth game of the year it's just part of the the routine of being a pro and I don't think that uh that he'll add anything additional to the to the repertoire\nStill ... and we see the keys to the match for next Wednesday no match this weekend\nBut we will get you ready for next Wednesday the abbreviated match against Tulsa on the other side of this break ins are saying he lived for an interview Toni wall scheduled to

requires a solid product pandas superb installation you get both\nFrom the contractor members of the flooring industry council their crews install Flora layers have four years of classroom hands on training\nUm yeah I watch it back um and I do every game but um\nYeah we had styles where we got the ball pretty well marked on the first time or we didn't create that many chances are we at times where we are dangerous [noise] um [noise] for the most part I think they're the same from our mistakes\nWhich I think like you said we have a we have you know stayed away from that area for a while um then I get the seconds it seemed like that dynamic and um\nLive all the capitalized those opportunities we kinda hurt ourself with those um you know and that kept the ball for awhile and their heat I think we there came a point in the game where we just you know I probably would have been All right off the road like three points but\nI think there came a point where we are just out of here with the points and you know move on to the next long because at this age\nYou know every point it's crucial obviously that didn't happen um you know about what can you do I think that was good we were organized decides to promote the game and like I said I came off you know in a bad area but you know that happens so\nMove onto the next one kind of thing\nTony walls is our guest are staying you law

and of course you hear him on our kickoff countdown show here in the big five fifty Katie are as she is in Missoula legend user mystery sports hall of famer he is partner\nMy Kelly on the tiger radio network is our good friend Howard Richards Howard good evening sir\nGood evening burning always a pleasure to be with you\nAnd Howard this is a special occasion tonight because you've got a great friend with you talking about something that I think is always important and should be top of mind for all of our listeners out there\nYes and and without further ado it like to introduce to our audience Mr Scott Garcia who's the president of premier state income planning\nScott welcome appreciate it good to be with you so let's jump right into this let's talk about the importance of of what you do why is the state planning important and who is a state plenty for\nGreat question probably the reason is they planning is so important as we really don't know what's gonna happen from day to day I ever think you'd be going great in your life and all of a sudden there's a sickness or death and you know a state planning if it's not done properly or not done at all there's some really really bad things happen to not only your family but you asked that you have that you want to go to your family\nStay planted probably for anybody who has assets and the state of Missouri the cut off his forty thousand dollars if you have a state of forty thousand dollars\nAnd you know a state plan or you have just a will you're gonna be a really good candidate for the probate process and probate is actually probate courts\nSo going forward looking at me what we're talking so urban conversational okay so in [noise] in in the situation um what if someone has a will well what if they only have a will someone does what happens\nIf they have is a will hold and we'll have to go through a program under Missouri law\nAnd what that means ... the word probate as far as a Latin word that means prove\nYou know when somebody dies the word probate means what to this person owns and what did they oh and the settlement of at a stage is gonna have to go through ...\nAnd with probate there's costs in Missouri the first hundred thousand of your state six point six percent will go to the pro big court won't go to your family or there is also a temporary injunction put on your property in your assets are could be up to six months will ask you the minimum is six months could be longer\nAnd then we are public record somebody goes through probate anybody has the ability to go to whatever city or you're in Cleveland this example because we're in the county I going to lose it all the probate files and I can make a claim\nAnd you're probably to set up the mentioned in the newspaper also so when I mentioned the cost of pro Beijing six point six percent of the first hundred thousand that's the minimum that's not taken effect somebody contesting or state and those things happen all the time\nSo clearly there's a misconception because most people are under the impression if they've got a will than their coverage\nSixty one percent of all people\nIf they've got a will than their cover\nThrough sixty one percent of all people based on the statistics we see I think that if they ever will they're going to be OK in of white probate when actually having a will and only will guarantees that\nPerson and probate interesting [noise] so why don't people plan for this process is it is it because they're afraid or people don't want to think about death and dying well what do you think\nOf that so I think number one people don't want to think about getting sick or dying or the information really isn't readily available most people think well if I Want to know about estate planning it's for the rich and famous and actually that's not true getting back to the forty thousand dollar number I mentioned almost everybody listening today is probably a candidate for probing\nUm what I think happens is most people don't have to go to an attorney and spend money to learn about how to avoid probate we make this process very simple because we give everybody a one hour free consultation to learn more and it's not only death what what we see in our in our situation with our company is\nYou know let's say there's a married couple of going down the highway you're going to a vacation and there's a terrible car accident in both people are in the accident or they're in a coma so somehow somebody the paramedic finds out that there's a phone number and the gentleman's wallet and he calls the\n... the number and it's one of the the people who are in the accident their kid well their child than calls their brothers and sisters they go to the hospital say that's my mom and dad what's going on well the hospital administration to stop that process and say well who are you three and there and say well what are the children are the people in the car accident while the ministers Minnesota well how do we know that\nWell the fact of the matter is they don't know that\nAnd now we've got a problem if you're the one in the accident you and your wife for you and your husband or in a coma and nobody can make a decision for you not only that bad but you put a tremendous amount of stress in your kids\nAs much as we can all the men why didn't the cardinals go get Christian yell at you I still think the ... trade was the right one to make and the success and at the time we were all applauding the marshmallows Luna trade\nI Can't remember every anybody standing up and applaud him but my colleague signing and like the day it happened to the day he was traded to Seattle nobody said boy\nThat might leak signing good thing the cardinals brought him over for\nWhat some Seventy or eighty million dollars good thing\n[noise] but there's going to be a lot of people showing skepticism over\nBill do its comments about being open for business and whether or not this franchise is really truly going to make a play\nFor the likes of Bryce Harper many Machado\nI I've I've come to this conclusion remember a couple of days ago we talked to bend fighters and then as men you know what what are some of the possible plan B Harper doesn't work if Machado doesn't work and let's let's be honest the odds on favorite certainly Machado the odds are it's not going to work\nAnd the ads for Bryce Harper unfortunately is that he's going to wind up in in LA or\nI I I'm Wondering about the cubs because of there's you know Jason hey we're talked a few years ago I remember when he signed with the companies say they've got a [laughter] everything's training up everything's pointing up words for the cutbacks where they've they've soon ... there soon to be

going to be in a couple of years\nI think it's a bad luck for Chicago and and [noise] and I'm Wondering how really truly active they were going to be this off season they're going to be very interesting to watch but found the cardinals I here's my mantra right now right this second\nI'm looking for the big bang free agents and Harper's ... ship it somewhere down the line say a curse Shaw

Shaw can opt out\nOf of his contract in and become a free edgy has its it's this off season ... can opt out with a sixty five million remaining on his contract so I guess who knows I I've said though from the very beginning don't get a starting pitcher you don't need a starting pitcher you're pitching trying to think it's gonna work out for itself but on the cardinals at this this is my approach\nFinally the big fish land me the big fish or\nIf you can't if the the big fish aren't biting that day go back to shore ... bring the fishing boat back call it a night\nWhen we we don't want one of those we we we don't need a little fish biting and signing with the cards thrown back if you catch one thrown back\nNow that that that may not ultimately lead to\nThe world series next year but I I'm trying to think big picture I really am\nBecause with all of these big contracts that have piled up Fowler\nCecil week\nYou know you've got ... for ... which works for a while but now suddenly it starting to look bigger than it really is worth\nLess it's a big name throw it back\nLet these other contracts hopefully fade away\nLet these other contracts hopefully fade away um trade them away or again they they just end at some point right\nYou need that money to fall off the books you don't need a new future dead money being added to the books and some of these like Microsoft is for instance there's a name that's going to be thrown around as a possible plan B\nJust say no on ... and this is coming from somebody that sort of advocated for moose blast off season\nI'm In less you get assigned to another one year deal like the royals did no no you if you're the cardinals you can't sign the second rate guys to big name contracts you can't do it it's going to hurt the bottom line so maybe you don't get harbor this time\nMaybe three or four years you can hit hit on trout may be in another five or six years you can hit on and Alex Redmond or a carnival is Korea\nDon't spend big money now to where it's hurting you done one because the cardinals have a built in excuse that if they don't get their guy this time wells because we've got all this money all this money going to Dexter Fowler breath to see so\nWe can't go on land that we got her ... graders for what was your opinion be if they if they pursue ...\nDonald soon to me didn't depends on the depends on the money now you get Donaldson for a year\nGreat do it absolutely I'm not sure he's going to be interested in a in a signing like that when you sign Josh Donaldson to have here's the thing I mean if we watch this movie play out with Donald sing the last couple of years pencil amend for missing Seventy games next year\nWhen he tells me he could be great\nOn the bench that a couple of days ago let's see\nLet's see how the play offs to go and see what he does and if he can earn a a big paycheck but are you are you hot to tried for Donaldson\nWhen St ...

S. and\nOne of the teams that it's been just rolling all year long a CBC they got a big one tonight against ... catching up with the CBC head coach Scott angle and it's got to integrate start to the season for you guys in coming off last week\nOne of the top teams in the nation for you guys to hang out and play with 'em you got to be very impressed with what you guys are doing right now\nYeah I think our guys getting ready to play last week um played a great weekend preparation last week and it kind of even blood in this week's preparation they kind of knowing now what it takes to kind of plan a high level\nUm you know anytime you have a high emotional game like that you always wonder how you can respond next week into I'm curious to see how we play tonight ... there's been this week obviously coming off of that type of a game of high level\nNot only just here in Missouri and in the metro area but nationwide plane that you know nationally ranked team\nYet we're very very weak a practice the guy's really locked in focus [noise] um I think you know when they got a number twenty over there and every thirty four over there that it's easy to get your focus on them because they're they're very special ball players are we talking about those to definitely be on it that St John standard that type of caliber player and you've got to get guys there to try to\nTry and group tackled him you can't give them open space and you know hopefully that's what we learned from last week\nYou know I just continue to be more and more impressed with what Brad Stone for you at the quarterback position that really seems like this year you're giving them a little bit more responsibility a little bit more of the play book and it's paying off in dividends for you guys\nBread and a quarter back I mean all the intangibles yes got to do throw run a but it's a decision making isn't getting in is in and out of bed plays a to those touchdowns were bred check because it gives a certain look and he checked her run and and you know he did a great job with it so\nHe's playing quarterback at a high high level and a lot of people don't understand what it means like where like they just think you're throwing them all but you know he's planning a position you\nKnow but also the offensive line I Know when we talked in a pretty easy and you had guys coming back but still a new group matching together [noise] boy and they come a long way\nTo have a you know coach the notice team does a great job with him he does he really gets into buying in um we're unique and that we really try to focus on every type of defense we might these are guys understand if they switched to the forefront of I switched in our front where our judgments are [noise]\nUm so they're able to make those adjustments almost fly and you know we know tonight ... them to shift to move around that\nYou know we feel like we got a good plan for that but our guys being veterans being experience they they probably the most anything that people can show let us well\nAnd I think a lot of that has to do with the schedule that you guys have played I mean you know when we talked earlier this year by you'd as being the affiliate member of the south western conference over in Illinois you know playing\nThose two teams and then getting into the emcee see you guys are pretty much seen every type of defense every type of front that you're going to see so that's got to make it make you and their coaching staff who really good to your kids can't make those adjustments and go with the flow at the drop of a hat\nI think so I think that's where the evolution of football's really related come to that there's not such thing as the five three monster anymore there's no such thing as a for for me they will play different ... different defenses most defenses are multiple now so you get from her for two or three different defenses\nThat was new about four years ago uh you know I think written a reminder of the first thing we had to play and versus with three different defense of front so we kinda got our toes wet then and now we've kind of you know it is that our bike trips there every week 'cause we we do\nWe plan for what we think we're going to see them we always playing for what we might see to\nAn end defensively you guys are just ... you know obviously we're not going to you last week of the gauge because that team is just that bit offensively but I think defensively you guys have just really really played maybe better than last year's team\nYou know we we talked about that as a defense of ... you know we will have the same a lot of the St pieces we had last year we brought back in ... in which you know as an upgrade a little bit there and then we lost on our board so we are trying to figure out that second safety the rotation right now we've got George Marshall major Jones in the mix there doing real good job of first year players\nAre ... but you know they're not a great job um yeah they don't get enough recognition and we know they know at twenty and thirty four all about and I said they're they're excited for that opportunity and\nYou know we really just got to try to limit their space and they understand that\nYou know it's an I ... we we all know what they're about they're coming in honor incredible streak was well planned extremely high level uh M. C. C. championship up on the line tonight you know talk about what you guys have seen on film and what you are going to need to do to get another um C. C. championship\nWhat'd you break down there all friends you know it starts with our guys up front they are very very good um they're they're they lay offs and guys I should but they just replacement looks like duplicate so they did a great job with a with their line\nUh you know everything goes through twenty and thirty four they're going to get in touch with her going about forty five forty or forty five touches tonight we understand that a and a quarter back you know he surprised me gets a little bit you can get out of pocket he can\nHe's not quite the on when it comes to run but they'll still run them enough to to keep the honest defensively you know you got to take care of their to back or they love the bullets in them and find Thurman Thurmond's dynamic and\nI Know twenties going to be out there on defense as well he'll be blitz an off the edge and do a whole bunch of different things we just got to try to minimize 'em all the different looks we can get and tried to play a little bit at a temple that kinda wearing them down and it gives us a lot of their guys do go both ways\nYou know that was the one thing I was going to ask was you know is tonight it'd be more of a ball control type game for you guys do because you know the numbers in the ... maybe ... really on your side or they're going to be one where you're trying to get put on the gas pedal and go all night long\nYou know I think then every time we have a discussion like that as a staff it's you know it's not quite our nature to kind of and to not go fast similar ... will temple but we also understand when her and he's been four minute drill or something like that but uh you know I expect you know Paul over there and try to sell the game down a little bit and and you know granted out with\nYou know ... and started quarterback I'll be surprised you know I think that there they know what they're doing and we know what we want to try to do and it should be an old fashioned a ghetto and cc grind out\nBecause they know what they're doing and we know what we want to try to do and it should be an old fashioned Gil FCC grind out\nYou guys are in the middle of a meat grinder for three weeks you said job last week it would be I can I and then then you get the the crafty veteran toys ever you know in rockers come into next week is weak nine kind of going to be a blessing for you guys have that week off before starting district play\nYeah I think so um we we can solve the last three games will be our guide whatever schedule and then when we last week nine I Know our boys were little upset because they lost the game or a chance to play high school football\nBut I think it can be a blessing for us we'll be able to get a you know bodies healed and you know try to get that role going for classics and see where in Texas this year I'm In\nThe district has really turned into an interesting district when you looked at it on paper to beginning of the year\nYou guys here's would central just met the unknown Marquette the ... the Mets been playing extremely well higher chance the Marquette last week even though they lost the Fox they're they're playing some great football so your district is not going to be as easy as a lot of people may have thought the beginning of the year\nGoing on I think he also forgot pat and they'll have a great job this year the Smith knowledge it's definitely\nYou know four or five teams that are planning a high level um and you know that's why I think seating so important um I understand in the way Missouri's playoff system works I was playing St john's probably could hurt us in the polls but it's going to help us in the long run I think as far as competition and seeing what we saw so [noise] you know it kinda even itself out of\nTrust me being on being a member of that panel on a pulley did not hurt you guys the way you play them last week I flat out said\nAfter seeing that performance day to day you guys are right now are playing the best football in the state of Missouri and\nThat leads me to my next question just a parity this year you know you it's great to see this ... making the comeback was was what Steve is doing and [noise] you know the markets of the world playing well and you go down the Jefferson County Fox playing while and stuck with", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "05"}
