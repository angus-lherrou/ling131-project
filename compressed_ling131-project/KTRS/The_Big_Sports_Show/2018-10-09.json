there it is a one of a kind\nAnd I can't wait to hear are all calling some flew back what you would you closed scrimmage that you saw this weekend was it that's what you tweet about the the building was just it was ... show coverage of practice okay well it was a closed in only open the play by play broadcasters and we don't know\nBut you got you gotta think sounded like they were looking pretty good\nI thought there were some really nice things happening uh with the ... and uh the most pleasant surprise most of it wasn't a surprise the most pleasant surprise was seeing a guy who I tried to kind of downplayed for the last four months and that is tremendous bell\nHe's real deal man you can play\nYou've stayed it's not like you're down on Isabel but you've been very religious\nAid it's it's not like you're down on Isabel but you've been very ill and we'll see you know ...\n... this this guy can do it\nSpring point guard right and the key is like I could see Seventeen per game six to ...\nWell I don't know down some shot I don't know about that because um you have so many weapons joke you probably don't need any one guy to do that um\n[noise] but he's certainly capable of that many points a game um what you'd like to see is um scoring out you're up for scoring percentages to be high\nAnd also your assist per game to be high and your assist turnover ratio to be very good if you do all those things the wrong numbers will take care of themselves\nYou know what I mean like a guy the guy has in baseball that that's the one common language we both had live high on base high slug all the counting numbers all take care of themselves can\nCounter and say that I and in St Louis and Travis word they've put together this tremendous roster some size ... cents room protecting shooting\nEverything is there but what hasn't been there the last couple of years and obviously you've Isabel is one of these new additions\nHis team hasn't been able to score at a very high rate heaven for somebody that could come in and theoretically get between Fifteen and twenty I see where you're coming from\nBut I don't think it's the worst thing in the world if Isabelle ... and again I mean he's not going to I don't think he's going to get in the north of twenty like he was at Drexel last year but a visible somewhere in that area where the Fifteen to twenty and that requires didn't take I don't know\nHow somewhere in the neighborhood of Fifteen shots per game I I'm On board with that and having do win in the neighborhood of maybe twelve points a game Gordon around twenty you\nKnow I don't I think it would I I don't think so uh Jordan good when there's a star player is a star player and I'm a I'm going to disagree and I'm gonna I'm gonna use history as an example um one of the great transfers that\nSt Louis basketball's ever gotten was a young man from Las Vegas name H Waldman yes who uh was a un Elvie player\nFrom Russian and then are not terrorists go the other the kid and then um\nAnd then you have to you know you move those guys around a little bit and I I think that'll help\nI said this yesterday and JT I fought back to comments that I think can Hitchcock would have made and again like Saturday and again having non studied the tape the film afterwards and you know just watching the you know the live deemed broadcast\n... how much did the blues sell out on Saturday to score as opposed to preventing\nChicago from scoring and how much have they done that obviously only\nScored one goal on on Thursday but it's got to thinking a little bit then it you can't feel I hurt my ... or do you know there are some really good goals and I'm thinking to myself or they're really good goals when you give up science\nObviously the fifth one coming in over time I'm a you know I I I don't know how you can be happy with the way this team played in any fast it other than some individual performances I like the fact that O'Reilly's already got what forces\nThat's kind of what you brought him over her own as an individual in a vacuum performance is going to okay that's what we were hoping to see but again as a whole big picture remmer uh again it's two games but I I don't think you can really like\nWhat you saw at collectively\nThe blues is a group in any way shape or form\nIt's only two games but to dismiss poor players it's early right that some counterproductive see I think so I don't think that's the way to take it out she wears this was not this isn't I think this is where you you say this is not a we expect to play this is not how we're going to play and gentleman\nWe'll find somebody else\nIf we're going to continue to play this way more of a chef who I was thinking of fire yes\nI thought he ... he if I recall he played a few minutes late with more ruining her Riley but he shoots left I Would have thought you know or maybe one of the other kids a move up\nUp there but anyway I just hey he knows his personnel or at least she's learning is personnel you don't know there's there's things more than just numbers that you try to click you know yeah I'm a nuance and chemistry and synergy and those kinds of things that\nMight take a while for them you know usually I don't worry about anything until Christmas when it comes to National Hockey\nDon't worry about anything until Christmas when it comes to the national hockey league but to really horrific games in a row that you you got to go up because now we're starting to season was ...\nI like to say wake me up in April when it comes to the NHL\nBut we\nWe we again we kind of\nNot actually [laughter] we want to go to the penalty box here in\nCheck in with Luis ... of course covered the game for a son or for boats Thursday and\nSaturday well yeah um I think I figured that Joe is not putting what they're doing is protecting gay gallon\nBecause on the mood on on Saturday was this is not ... fault is the effect that small and then he would tell an Alan yet to yeah and then yells set on Saturday to it after the game that this thing is not playing hard winning hockey\nAnd that already looking which of the players that are in the combination\nPerfect perfect segue hear Louise to make use of comments are trying to find those guys that can come through and crunch time\nIt's brutal and [noise] like I said this is not what hockey there were fires right now so this is\nJust as we can we can try to analyze or figure out whatever the reasons are maybe with maybe we just say that we're maybe I'm maybe with more competition guys are thinking that if they will score a little bit more of them that'll put them out of the game [noise] um [noise]\nThe really the way that you're going to get ahead of the game is is when have less than when I'm when I signed it that's how it's going to be all those guys\nAre going to do things that just went off the game so that can be keeping the ... obviously that could be often too says he's going to get more opportunity if somebody is hurting us and he's going to start to lose opportunity that's that's just the nature of the game\nYou know the second half of that clip is kind of more like I would've expected from somebody like a king Hitchcock and and sort of like a you know for all the goals you want to see if you're losing it there's there's something fundamentally wrong with\nThe with the core of this team if you're again if we can get another four goals and regulation and lose five to four and overtime I yeah I even get a score for like you did Saturday square one like you did on Thursday it's not a winning recipe remmer and\nUm the team is defending ...\nStarting goal tinder Jake gallon this was a lot of tourists and go after\nEvery month or the humans are\nRight away normal if it goes thing with a sometimes do first came in from Jake it's\nJust like you know a\nLot of the support him with ...\n... ... if I don't know if your goal is to blame on also find out the waste will help him like ... you know take all sorts of each other it's a good one to give up so many goals but again like I always said if I'm not from the\nUh you you you're used to be do you feel strongly in this room or I Will just say all setting goals not Jake gallons fault having said that ten goals\nDoesn't look good and doesn't speak well to a\nProjecting Jake gambling forward I'm afraid\nFirst of all you really appreciate blood Vlad the way he handled that that would that's produce those guys are you in a teen guy I think it shows maturity um you know that we're hoping to see from him anyway and that's really really good you know I'm\nHowever and yes the defense was not very good and that includes the foreign words you know coming back to play in the defense of zone yeah it was all bad it was all terrible and the team takes off that's absolutely right\nUm but you know the booze up\nOver the last half dozen years she might they always make the wrong decision goal tending wise\nGoal tending personnel they always choose the wrong direction I I Can't I couldn't do any better I don't pretend to but you know and I normally don't believe in results oriented thinking but when you sit back and look\nIt is it's ... you know in the end it's about results about your team and they have not they've not done the\nDone a very good job at that particular position now I I think of a you go back and you should you look at take go back and look at two of the goals I Can't remember which ones on Saturday Night but go back and look twice ...\nTheoretically your best guy\nSpawning completely around his back to the park and given place now you could argue well here's a guy trying to do too much 'cause they were okay I understand that\nShe still can't do it you can't do it you can't turn your back on the play again he's you know he's scrambling and they're you know they're losing momentum and I I get it I understand why it all happens but if you're good at team if you have a good team you don't do that\nSo those these are the little things that they have to achieve individually then collectively and then as an entire group to be better all those little things have to happen\nThat big blue show tomorrow night with the tea something to think about leading into tomorrow night and we can talk about with Jim but\nYou're you're a guy that doesn't worry you know you'd ... you'd have a team spent three hundred million dollars if they could be as you always say it's not your body\nYou know they've got they've got a a a a ceiling right well especially especially in hockey there's a there's a salary cap and Catholic so you've got to figure out exactly is easy no my question is is\nIt had they not already been committed long term but chicken Allen West off season and even with ... and being older if they were both in that same place the British hit free agency\nWith the blues decision had been would it would it have been different ...\nThat I wasn't even choosing Jack Taylor but he was signed and they were sort of in between a rock and a heartbeat where I didn't ... oh they were or I might have been the guy they ultimately wanted it and I was it was a tough spot to be in ... you know yeah that's too\nI feel forum tough to put a winter out there they don't they don't want first of all they don't deserve and they haven't earned sympathy in pity from the fans what they've earned a winning team the fans are I mean what a winter out there it's been over fifty years by God\nI mean there are Little Rock in a hard place that's a bunch of bologna though\n[noise] get out of a rock and a hard place you professionals and find out what the topic find a way to win that's not good enough and they would sit right here and tell me that I'm right\nThey were telling me I'm right the fans and immediate need to quit making excuses for him\nIt's [noise] it's funny that did the berries getting all this blow back right now because it's completely different than theirs start last year when they were you know\nWhatever it was um after that terrible month of September and they got you know they got the barn doors blown off\nBy Auburn and Purdue in basically a two above the first three weeks or the the\nTwo of the first three weeks of the season but\nYou know these two losses rumored to me I I think it showed that there were some mistakes being made and I know somebody like you it's going to be you know kind of cut and dry wins and losses but I\nI I I think to me this team is showing enough it with your best receiver having not played a this past Saturday and and really was a non factor against Georgia because of the injury there's enough I can take away from this and and be\nFairly optimistic if I'm I'm a zoo fan you know take away the fact that they're playing Alabama you just expect that is going to be a loss this weekend I think there's some some building blocks from this past weekend\nWell what you don't like though is that you had a game [noise]\nHad to write in your hand we have no doubt that show no matter how many games you when you should have won one more [noise]\nIn all those things matter at the end when you're trying to get a ball and make more money and do all those things and um this is a game you have\nYou had the game [noise] I agree with you ... you take away some really good things for three of the four corners you our plate South Carolina in my opinion yes one hundred percent [noise] third quarter from hill what [noise] what you\nAnd I don't I don't have an answer on how to fix it [noise]\nI don't know the personnel I don't know the communication issues [noise] but [noise]\nThey didn't handle a diversity\nAnd rather than okay you made a mistake we stop at now is just collect ourselves get back to playing like to know how to play with a kept getting worse and kept getting worse and it looked like a completely different team and the rain and they felt completely apart [noise]\nUm that's the thing that's got a\nStrict and coach Olbermann everybody's craw up there because they had a game and they let it go\nBy them not being able to handle versatile really really frustrated there\nWas a it appear to be a shock to the system berries did it after the game or you know you looked at his phone and said twenty percent chance of rain but he said uh I assume that eighty percent chance that it wasn't going to rain so when you see something like that in your ... and yours is almost predisposed ... say\nThis is the way it's gonna be an ... and ... the type of conditions they saw I guarantee you never entered any of their minds that it would be something like that that was for a while they look biblical storm\nComing down on them and it wasn't just like two minutes your two minutes there that was a good half hour forty five minutes where it was a constant deluge\nAll those things are true\nBut you you you can't accept that as a team [noise]\n... you you don't care what you don't care what\nYou got to be able to react to it positively you can't just fall apart and they completely fell apart\nAnd it was a ... and that's why they are frustrated [noise]\nDamage next\nIt down on the matter [noise]\nJust you know the country that's why I'm not even really that concerned about losing the Georgia might be the second best team in the\nPeople in Georgia might tell you the best team in the country where they might you might be right so that but then what you've got to do is you've got to find a way to learn from the first games of the first as she see games [noise]\nBeen learned from that and figure out how to win the rest of the [noise]\nIt's going to help to get hauled back for starters and whether that's this weekend are moving forward um my point is has been here [noise]\nThey've got time they're still write the script it's going to be difficult ... it's going to be difficult to schedule does not lay out in a friendly fashion form a zoo but it's still in front of a ... there's a lot of time left and I I don't get the uh the [noise]\nAlmost just brushing and wearing a notion that ah that that the berries and in huge trouble he's got a lot of work to do a lot of there's a lot of season\nLeft would address that for a couple of reasons one is I hate for people to lose their job I've been out of work it's not good [noise] and uh so I don't\nI don't I Try not to get involved in those things and the the other part is I don't know what the suits that ... thing I really don't know [laughter] and many ways they probably don't know to like you're from the big boosters sure show solve all those things play into it and I'm not trying to duck it [noise] um [noise] what third\nAnd there's nothing to talk of all I'm saying it's he's got he's got time and there are a lot of people that are just sort\nOf brushing him aside and I think it's it's way too early and you know you I Know I get a ... but you you you talked to have your recently saw some people every now and then a ... to ...\nDo you see the Texas Oklahoma game no being any great detail lock orange put a forty eight and a gym powers mentioned walking in a little earlier that\nMy ... got fired as defensive coordinator down there in Norman and and the suitors bomb to basically fall out of their cat bird seed there in the big twelve ... forty forty five ... maybe the ...\nTheir cat bird seed there in the big twelve\nTaxes wins forty forty five ... maybe the game of the day in college football\nIt doesn't always ... and it didn't remember this game they're like ten years ago when we were staying Bradford in colt McCoy a Mack Brown is the head coach Bob soups on the other side this was the game of the year in college football not so much anymore but\nThere still is there though what it is no doubt no doubt about it still matters there it matters in a big way and a Texas put themselves right in the middle of the big twelve race you said to hear from beginning river that\nThe big twelve it's going to be fascinating to watch this race [noise] um if they get\nTo Italy you happy it might have one loss\nWell they got they got through West Virginia runs the table and that's what they gotta hope to stay in it [noise] stay in the high\nTech word to weed out though [noise] and with a with just one loss [noise] I I wouldn't completely be ready to uh to write off taxes they look awfully good right now\nWell I Would if there are four or five teams that are undefeated [noise] all\nRight wing and you get to that point shirt there if they're\nYou know we can do is go by now right there if we're going to go by what is happening now [noise] um [noise]\nYou know [noise] their hopes got to be on West Virginia and there's fear is when you get a yearly championship\nGame and now now everybody's got a washer and that's that's where I Do agree with you [noise]\nThe ah and then is this kind of fun to start [noise] stacking up the teams that do have one last now and who should be ahead of\nGetting really up to a group of the\nUpper level one last teams it's funny if you break it down the way I Do buy buy who beat who writes not by\nPundits opinions [noise] Kentucky's [noise]\nThe head of that group [noise] she beat Florida right and ah [noise] had\nTo tell us you beat Miami and I'm Flora\nBeat LSU right so it starts all stack up a little bit there and then you know Texas is over Oklahoma so you start to see how they start to get in line a little bit [noise] what\nWould it what's interesting is if Georgia and Alabama went out and they play in the SEC championship undefeated thinking we're a long long ways away but it it clearly does look like right now ... one Georgia's too and you mentioned a lot of people in Georgia or maybe didn't the bulldogs your number one if those two teams run the table\nAnd get to the SEC championship game what is to become of that team that loses\nAnd I've heard this All right ... you take all your job in a way far ahead I've already heard it brought up a ton this past weekend that if ... if that were bought a loss SEC runner up\nIn the championship game what are the chances of them getting into the playoffs for an undefeated let's let's here's an as an example and undefeated Notre Dame team as we mentioned last week and what happens\nToday if it's Notre Dame versus Georgia [noise] they would vote for Notre Dame Notre Dame versus Alabama [noise] assuming you know saying Georgia beat Alabama in the gym\nIn the checkout found [noise] ... that's ... that's how I Would vote but that's me predicting how they would\nThey could still lose but their schedule is really starting to shape up nicely and they\nWill you've done was demolished attack you got nine or ten defeated teams left undefeated teams [noise]\nSo [noise] you know a lot has to happen for we start breaking it down but you can you can sort of see how you know one last will knock the team back for a while now if you really like chaos like I Do what you have to hope is\nYou get everybody know undefeated teams then it really gets swept then it\nGets fun of all I'll say this just right now on record undefeated Notre Dame I don't care who is in the SEC with one loss I don't care who's got his undefeated in the pack undefeated Notre Dame is in the playoff yeah\nYou know the brewers are really playing in in the end and the Dodgers ah their studs it's really fun\nRebels you tomorrow night ready to go that spot Ramsey or Britain wasting the prep sports report is next we'll dig five fifty

to make a nice run 'em I'm telling you CBC\nWe'll talk about them quite a bit here tonight and later on they've got a big one with rockers that I think is going to go a long long way to determine\nWho's gonna win classics even though I can tell you right now after what I've seen at a CBC the last two weeks they're the best team in the state all classes there the probably one of the best teams in the mid west\nAnd the state um I mean they're just playing at that level and I made the comment to you and ram or a little bit ago\nThey could be most division three schools and some a handful division two college schools they're that good old statement that are very bold yeah but I tell you what did this and I said it's friday night on the Fox to RB's perhaps on\nUm this is the most complete CDC team that I've seen in covering high school sports in the last Fifteen Years and I'm not afraid to say that against some of the great teams that they've had that have one state championships\nThis team is balanced they do everything correctly they don't make a lot of mistakes\nAnd they just are they're just doing things the right way and I think this team is going to go along the I think they could win the state championship and plastics very very easily\nThrough there shouldn't come as a surprise to folks in the ... this\nWeek state ranking starting with plastics that CBC is the unanimous choice with twelve first place votes six in one in class\nIn ... choice which well first place votes six in one in ...\nNo no no change and this week you get you last week we had a battle a two top five teams and classics this week we got to battle a two top three teams in CBC rockers will get a really good gay John where CBC is even though I think CBC\nTakes care of their business at home friday night against rockers that we're all be during the press preview Sean friday the unclear so from or perhaps Casey is going to be joining me and we're really going to get into that game and break it down a little bit because it's probably the biggest game in the state of Missouri\nI think so and maybe again among the biggest games of the year when they when they get the get together and what what's uh when when they meet again in and they couldn't be ... so that's okay are opposite gotcha gotcha a are modeled\nAs though they would they would meet in a state championships and Airbus rocker still has to get through leaf summer west to is the number four team in the state\nA eureka number two off of a monster win against Kirk would I actually stopped up their\nEureka was leading at the half or ... you know they were tied at the half then eureka scores to go up on the first possession then all of a sudden curb quid goes touchdown turnover touched down to take the lead twenty Twenty one and then the wild cats just turned it on to to another level\nAnd took care of Kirk would so eureka moves up the number to de Smet number five now they moved back up\nAnd they would it looks like as of right now the Borgias than ever to team Kansas things one is that they play and a two story that tradition certainly in terms of fan bases would get together more than likely I'm at the lake\nI Would be All right to see that game oh I Would road trip to see that I'm On I'm On\nBoard with Kim it's in the past Pacific can probably either ... or union right now the find themselves in it but\nUm I if\nI'm pretty sure came buttons in webs a Web site at the brackets native saying get they get weapon the quarters and and obviously find they're pretty tough test their wallet does drop out after getting a a frontal by Lebanon\nWill do at pat and build this Friday night will do Kirk with next friday night so we'll do lose\nTheir other and the rest of the way I got out of school and I'll tell you that they they wouldn't\nDeserves some consideration to be number was\nBeating to class you know one and I agree with you if they can knock off to classics one scene\nTold again I Want to get a commitment from Jim Powers right here regardless of what ... does so it can we get a commitment from you that you will vote would do more than ... ... and they beat pat and they'd go if they'd be two classics teams throw it away\nI break ranks and I vote blue number one because they deserve it they just weren't would be a thousand times better than what weapons is without a doubt everybody hurt me sent her to hear first turn it here first\nSlum or let's move with the class three where um there is talk about the ... of the race you've got to split their ashes top Odessa undefeated six first place votes but there's trinity five and two with six first place most of their own\nSorry they're going to split the vote the rest of the way they're just they're both gonna window last two they're both going to split the vote and it's going to stay one twelve one eleven\nI just that's the way the trinity place to hide this week to take care of that you know take care of that stuff Odessa is extremely talented I really think\nBarring something stupid happening\nI'm I really think you could see Odessa trinity and the state championship game\nUh you know rare three seven into\nThat district file between trinity and Ritter is going to be really really good but once again I just think trinity he's got a little too much in the tank for cardinal Ritter Maryville forecast they'll five um ... it's just you know class three right now honestly it's Odessa and trinity's world and everybody else is just\nKind of hanging out in it there's some powers though in this in this class there was no doubt about it the bottom half of the top\nTen has Mount Vernon six in more than six St Clair still hanging around their number seven with six someone record uh Springfield Catholic comes in there at eight there six in ... southern Boone and nine five and to read spring\nTo pretend that five and two ... until ... burly savannah in Kennett all receiving votes as well\nNot a lot of changes their Mount Vernon starting to\nKind of sneak up the poll just a little bit but everybody in the top five of just taking care of their business they've done everything they're supposed to do and that's the way it should be I mean ... when you get to this part of the season you better be taken care of what you need to take care of on friday or Saturday\nAnd if you do that everything's going to be fine\nYou let everything go and then we see what the district seems will be like next Saturday\nIt's going to be fine you let everything go and then we see what the district seems will be like next Saturday evening\nIn class to Jim and this is the phone class at least at the top because I I I think these two teams are on a collision course Lamar getting all the first place votes they're seven into Blair oaks\nSeven to know number two way through seven into number three Lutheran north hanging in there for three play the sub scheduled for last in in at five record is six in one of the top five you're Jimmy\n... beats Lawson last week that's where the discrepancy is Luther north you know finally playing people in the state of Missouri taking care of their business there they get farmers on friday night which do beat you know pretty handily I Would assume\nI ... but the thing is blur oaks is playing at such a high level that aren't always do I mean but but then you add the the X factor Tesla page their new head coach the old Jeff city coach\nSo don't sit there and Charlie folks and Jeff said he was the coach it wasn't a coach look what he's doing it Blair oaks okay I mean you know the bottom line is titled page can flat out coach Blair oaks had a great group of kids coming back but their schedule has been brutal this year and they're beating people\nCents less so do you have three schools and ... got Jeff city Elias ... yeah ... is ... obviously there are always lower in class or the the better the foot but always a matter of football program\nI mean I hate to say right now you know what the pecking order is blur oaks ... city yeah I hate to say that you do with all the tradition and that can stadium you hate the heat you have to go down that road but unfortunately that's the way it is right now and then you've got the Ford school coming on line in the next two years down the ... city\nSold now it even splits the pile up even more which makes it really interesting but I tell ya it right now\nLamar Blair oaks body that's going to be a good game if it gets to that\nI think it will just depends on where is it is it the ... I'm not sure I'd have the late\n... I'd have to look to bracket to see where it where that would fall but they're going to match up I think both for Columbia so that's where that's where it's going to be a lot of fun\nRustic less to his court county six and when it's six Monroe city six and seven making five and to their aid Palmyra six in one there none have jumped from the non ranked to the rank their number two with a record of six in one more Callaway drops out of the poll\nThat he thinks the other I mean pretty much have a moving in a north Callaway dropping out after losing last week I actually had Lexington and there are over a but I like what lessons done this year so you could flip flop those either way but really just you know good group down at the bottom part of that\nPoll fair grove playing the sisters of the poor every week there's seven\nAnother one sniff of the Titanic had made that you're fortunate thing is you know their schedule just as being kind or they're they're beating the people that are supposed right but the unfortunate thing is those people just aren't really that good clearly clearly a class war and hate size seven\nOr eight oh seven first place votes western six in one for the first place votes Fayette sixty one in three east people can get in the first place vote six in one they're four and more saline at six and a woman or a five\nTime work at a time to talk of the guy from the ... trade ... Porter from Roosevelt has a lot of great ties down from the ... everybody have ties playing terrific football right now\nUh you'd I knew it was going to be close between them and western I actually put hay Taiwan western too\nFaint playing great ball he's Bach you know they were the number one team last week they lost a tough one um over the weekend mar saline sitting at five valley Catholic moving up one the number eight I mean class wind is just going to be an interesting class to kind of figure out the rest of the way\nRash of a class one pierce city seven into their six Lincoln sixth one there's seven valley Catholic five and two the rate cast midway seven no Milan seven and oh\nAt number two and\nYeah and I and I had penny down to number tense lot I mean I was really surprised that they dropped down but cast midway it's playing fantastic right now and uh you know on the line is is the you know those teams are doing what they need to do right now I mean that's what you're supposed to be doing you're supposed to be winning ... games get ready for district play at the end of the season\nFor great things about penny great things about Hamilton penny\nOh I I Love that team I mean you know they've had some tremendous athletes and I've had a chance to call some of their championship games and then for the last what do they really really [laughter] I mean you know their their rights ads of battles with valley I mean I was just terrific\nShip powers that Britain we see it is perhaps sport support powered by the high school sports caravan time for our first break GAPP what's coming up next we're going to do\nA little ... gel and I I\nReally feel I missed that we haven't gone there just yet but you know trade Porter over Roosevelt second year coach five and two on the year but thinks he's done with this program\n... it's really cool and so I I wanted to get him on tonight to talk to him about some of the cool things that he's doing his kids are playing well but it's still way that he's getting out in the community and really promoting the program which is really caught my attention being the south to the guy who else have you heard a lot of the great things as well so we'll talk to trade Porter next\nBut we'll do that all the other side of the spread of the big five fifty K. T. R. S. Missoula football color analyst Howard Richards\nMy father died without a well I I ended up finding insurance policy in in the new and and when he knew from being through his affects\nScott Garcia premier estate an income planning\nMost people are the understanding that if they have a we'll build like probate that's all they have in most cases they will not have white probing too which is a vast majority of people find that out too late and really they planning is not complicated can be with us it's not complicated we have a Nineteen Ninety proprietary process we can do most of the state plans Ninety percent of it with a Ninety minutes\nAttend the next educational workshop Tuesday October twenty third\nAnd Thursday October ... pm the pasta house in Arnold, Missouri called three\nWell how much better than we got in a\nBox that costs you hate that before so we did a lot of work with him this summer as well\nAnd just a bad day with him on the ball on them this year versus not even being able to run players last year\nAnd then even at Danbury or we had great success but the thing is you know for two groups you know we have two programs now with Cleveland enroll does that who weren't very successful you know they they like winning they like attention they like to give the people people are actually coming out the games now\nSo that alone is when I feel has banned the momentum to keep them on the goal because now they're not the laughing stock of the league anymore\nYou know bringing them myself for South city guy\nAnd I actually lived up in power grows area about five blocks away from Roosevelt\nWhat you've done to galvanize that area and get out and get your guys out to\nDo you know community service and getting you know the community behind you is just unbelievable to talk a little bit about that and what really made you try to go that direction to help get the support that you've been getting\nWell get coming from rural Missouri friday night lights and ... and ... and the whole cities yes six thirty ready to get your gas you get your food and it gets to the stadium\nSo knowing that ah the cargo east they have a park they had meetings almost I think is the last two months I when I go to a lot of those clocks park neighborhood association\nI go to a lot of there and beans I was actually has a ... a week ago so it was banned the state's going to community it's hard for me to see it costs you can't just sit back and go to work at a school and not be invest it in the community and they get their school takes parks and so\nOnce I once I got there and I think that I had a support system around the school it was easy to kind of dive in and work they're mad with those committing these people were\nLeaving us but he wants to hurt our savings and loan as are in America you can kind of get stuff done\nGo to you know I covered high school football for a while a lot of the coaches that have come in contact with I I get a sense that they're teaching lived life lessons along with teaching the game of football what do what if any life lessons do you like to sort of been hard on your team that are sort of\nA you can associate with the game of football\nWell you know it's funny that you say that I feel like it's part of our success was me as a as myself [noise] taken a backseat to the game of football uh last year we would want in being on ... and I knew we missed the third dimension so we we got we got a guy we gotta gotta have\nA friend of mine from the AFC gay who actually came in a in a lot of faith in our kids and\nCity kid I realized that you know a lot of them didn't grow up in churches and uh so I was able to get asked to come over the words a lot of my patients hadn't ban who didn't know\nSo uh that that for me you know we got out or we were on the FCC hotter with our school actively uh we got kids one FCAT camps I actually work and they have stay camp in summer or so I think that third dimension of cultural\nOverall is if a head matches behind all access that a lot of people don't see\nSo you know everybody talks about bat values of family football\nAnd you know do the three things that I never use a man that I don't ah criticized for student if you know last year I had a kid that was a Islam ... who has the list for a ... you know I respect his face enough not to punish him what happened miss\nAnything there any excuse their family base you know I just take it and get ready because I Know it was something bigger and football\nSure no doubt about it let's talk a little bit about\nYou know the rest of the way you you got Miller in a big big match up friday afternoon five o'clock\nOver gave way and then you finish up with the south city or to Sound City battle with bishop to burn a couple of games that you know one for a conference championship the other one you don't want to look ahead into the district play because you never know what can happen talk about these last two games\nWhere you know real courage cat and may have been the cream of the crop for public high league probably for the last six or seven years I Know when I moved here that's all I heard about and I actually met through Harvey when he was coaching over last year he retired issue here\nAnd he's not there anymore so I got to go when we last last year and we got limited from playoffs I went to a Lutheran or I Want the Lindbergh and I went to ... to see what those programs are doing it I wouldn't doing practice wise\nAnd you know the discipline in a tough issue that all those programs hey there's something that I had to go back and reevaluate my program on and we'll get older you know they they have a lot of discipline kids they got a lot of good players right now\nBut you know I feel like we got just as many and it's going to be a shootout or it could be you could go either way and uh I like what they're doing over there they got a new coach charge 'em all Cooper who would opt ... last year\nYou know so he knows this stuff he knows what he's doing so it's a different than mine it a ... office in my head coach and\nYou know we were just going to battle it out and saying with the bird you know they got a new coach Tyrone marred she's a good friend of mine actually talked to him about three hours ago\nBut it just hits your wife should narrow it in the same business you're getting us\nAnd you know we stayed at right now we may have to pay them\nBack in a bad week so you definitely can't look ahead because it any more it's hard to be the same twice\nSo you'd be ... if if we beat them and then it'd be hard for them to be us again or we'd be if they beat us it'd be hard so definitely can't look at it because we had a mutual pony early in the season with ... percent and gaps in hand to vote for it was pretty handily or early in the season for both teams center so it's hard you can't compare scores\nI definitely want to get through the aid first before I start talking about the bird well I'd say well one thing I Want to\nYou see a first before I start talking about the ... well\nI tell you what one thing I Want to mention and I know you're ... guy um what about ... making a move up to number one in ... in the top that pulled this week\nYou know it's funny you know being part of repeal [noise]\nYou know I was at each prairie ... money yeah more and more to it you know that graduated I went to college there year they they get well after I lay off each for two years there we're over ten on and on ... I went down there one day I we were\nFive and then what happened to forward and I came up to a shot\nSo being a part of the reviewers you see it coming because a lot of those kids don't have that ain't right now our fingers were born they were a fresh start and try to orange or\nSo you've seen it come it it gets worse than patient and going through the process and they went and got a buddy of mine to be their head coach he's eight native a dummy Robin ...\nSo you know we say that comment being down in southeast Missouri but they did with down there you can kind of force feed her future because it's not a lot of traveling is that a lot of movement in some of those kids have been trying to get his fourth fifth grade you know it just the chemistry there\nAnd I know you're proud of your roots done in the Boot Hill area and\nYou know what I Know exactly where he is Perry is I don't know about it is and I've been to have died so I don't know exactly where you're talking about coach well hey I Know it's a busy time for you we appreciate your time\nAh so you know as as south city guy in Britain themselves to the guys were so happy and so glad to see the success for Roosevelt uh this year we hope you keep things going and I know you'll be talking a here throughout the rest of the season\nI grab a gay guys know prompt say us manage\nWhat a great job trades done over there I mean ... what they've done just to galvanize that area and tower grove east is just unbelievable and they've you know we done the stadium and it was it the ... it was the kids and the coaching staff\nThat that was out there painting and cutting the grass and we're doing things and you know what trays done is just really really cool and it's great to see that in South city\nIt's it's hard to you and your battle that perception\nOf a of of schools in the public schools in inside the city limits of St Louis it's a\nIt's hard work and all the job he's doing is just remarkable\nYou know the thing is you see you see the football field up a Roosevelt but then you go down the street about three miles and you see the ... you know you see\nA you know gateways stadium with the artificial turf then you go to you know the ... then you go north the north east academy\nAnd yet in order to be successful you you've got to take care of your house in in trade brought that hard work and wanting to make the best out of a bad situation and that's what they did up a Roosevelt it's really cool to see\nWhat your powers are Britain we see is the big sports show the big five fifty Katie are is on the other side of the brave we'll look ahead to some of the big match ups coming up this weekend is huge Trump sports report power by the high school sports caravan of the big five fifty [noise]\nHave a question for you what to foreign companies have been in St Louis favorites since Nineteen\nSeems seems to be worked out\nA bill getting is a Carolyn Kendall bets on as it seems like the the front woman if you will be a mood or the majority stakeholder if you will in this whole process for the first time ever I'm a I'm a woman\nA majority stakeholder in this entire deal\nThat that's that's pretty important isn't it and\nEntire deal that that's that's pretty important isn't it and it it it that's probably another pretty huge aspect that separate St Louis from all of those other cities that you mentioned\nIt dramatically dramatically Brennan separate St Louis uh along with the woman you just mentioned colonel and Kendall bats are there are six other female members of the Taylor family involved um the St Louis team would be the first\nFirst female majority owned club or the league's history and a really for all intents and purposes is one of the few and all of professional sports\nAnd as we talked about so many times of the league as a sport for a changing America some of the new expansion sites are going crazy a number one at the top of the list\nIs that land to they have the MLS all star game this year against your event is in the same stadium where the south and play and everybody knew well advanced that even know what an all do have not and not ... had already signed excuse me what event there's\nBut due to the lay off after the world cup he was not going to be even president in Atlanta nonetheless\nSeventy three thousand people for an MLS all started getting making sure that this in Atlanta it's taken off their uh it really started this new uh participation phase with the fans all the spectators in Seattle which started the drove over thirty eight than party three thousand so\nIt is really taking over in various pockets of\nThe country and one of the main areas that has been sorely lacking uh since the inception of the league in Ninety six is dead center in the Midwest in St Louis would link up obviously against\nChicago, Kansas city Dallas Houston uh Columbus little further up eastern United States but nonetheless it's a perfect fit but in particular in particular all those other cities I named\nEvery city every state just about gone soccer crazy now takes its lead from the city of St Louis that established the popularity of the sport in our country starting way back in Eighteen Seventy five\nYear bill let's go from the sublime to the ridiculous I Want to challenge um some members of the soccer mafia and also a a generation of hipsters\nWho you talk shocker or I I only watched the ... I only watch the Premier League new mail less if you have a lot of recession\nYou are not you are not a genuine in St Louis soccer fan okay I'm not\nNaive is an expansion team I Am a last bit of gunfire and music in the ... take on top of hops for liberal or Manchester\nCity of course now we understand that however\nIt's MLS is coming to St Louis you claim you are a soccer fan is mandatory that you get on board\nHere we go I agree and you know what I'm I'm John you know me I'm always going to be signed the wise guy angle yo yo yo know but you you know what\nI think that um to show that I think people will respond the way you suggest he's just looking at the crowds for St Louis fc\nYes precisely a average you on a regular basis a well a little bit for thousands and it's for your job and I've written in ... to ... probably yeah probably the biggest games\nOr in their short franchise now are all night\nAnd we much that we want to make a note of the fact that tomorrow night's game or not not starting at seven a third of the novel star climates at seven o'clock tomorrow against also that the rescheduled game from July fourteenth a window Armageddon\nFenton the weather was just ... again yeah\nSo a ... or say has an idea they have the chance to get into the playoffs right in front of them get they get six points get they get six points from these two games and the ending up on what happened for the other teams in front of them they can go from where they are today ninth place\nWow would be huge ... they are totally changed team from last year no unfortunately they ran into some injury they lost three players three players were injured\nAnd their last away again in Phoenix but nonetheless\nThey have other players a step in a and they'll give ... all they want tomorrow night that the thing about ... says there in last place they're not going to come to play they don't care yes they do their professional soccer players they're playing for contract either for Tulsa next year or to get awareness someplace else in the league\nBill correct me if I'm wrong you mentioned the six points they could uh you know sort of climb all the way up to six but a beginning ... if they get for Bill Murray and right\nYes sir Yes sir or even even Antonio ... one of the in their favor of St Louis hep C is that a game was left right everywhere from the league that they're combating for that final playoff spot only has one game and that San Antonio's last game on Saturday Night will be played at the exact\nSame time as the saying was that the okay see energy again so this is really intriguing and it gets the schedule makers that somehow some way and once again they prove that they know what they're\nDoing yeah I tell you what the tomorrow as we were kind of we were looking at this week or so ago and and we're kind of plenty when can they you know socially college and we thought OK maybe Wednesday night\nOf this week would be the earliest opportunity well San Antonio kept winning so yeah it could Saturday it really does not matter what it would St Louis does\nTomorrow would certainly I'm a I'm a win or a draw would help um ne ne will regardless have to have to play for their lives on Saturday because let's say they live bill let's say for some unforeseen reason\nThey lose tomorrow then suddenly I I don't think they would have their own destiny in their hands I Believe in that point San Antonio could wind Saturday and it wouldn't matter what the home to you know they're really under\nThe gun because of the the the a number one I'm a ... a ... a number of when you have a which shows San Antonio would come out on the edge but a bag of an ideal opportunity to do it\nUh is Anthony ... says told me he told me just yesterday that\nSome of the players were down after the last game uh that uh San Antonio won an Anthony who said I was just the opposite I thoroughly expected San Antonio\nTo win all of their remaining games just because of his position in which they find themselves so or they're not in the process not changing anything they may or may have to change a couple of players because of injuries and their first eleven\nUh but this is a solid team that really took hold in the middle of the year and a interim over a ...\nTwo or three weeks uh [noise] yeah about two or three weeks time period they won four games they caught a couple of but they haven't playing very well it it it's a different team playing a dramatically different style\nBill I don't sing St Louis and she could have a better promotional tool right now and the fact that the MLS thing is is starting back up again for those boats that may be just forgot or or or again weren't aware yeah we've got a professional\nThose folks that may be just forgot or or or again weren't aware yeah we've got a professional team already here and a ... ... if they're if they're super star bright now you can get out to fit in these next two nights it's going to be phenomenal\nTremendous are out there a it's a great environment you see tons of people that you know as always references soccer off yeah a good record Sean I'm a Jew from their duty do come up at all and uh you could be more accurate it all works hand in hand\nOr an an answer to potential future questions yeah\nSt Louis hep C will continue to exist\nOr even though there might become the MLS team here yet and the over your become like a club everywhere else in the world where players are um\nPlaying for positions on the upper club so that translates USAO most portly most importantly on this thing at St Louis has been striving for since the late began in Nineteen Ninety six\nThat is for St Louis to get back on the show soccer back\nIn one more for you well I ... I got a couple of more here as we as we should back the MLS how quick does this process\nYet us to actual MLS soccer in St Louis where I'm at and again and nothing's official yet but it got ... if everything goes as a we hope it does when when's the earliest we see MLS soccer here\nThat exact question was posed Andy Taylor today Brandon and he said we do not he should I'm sure I Can't give you an advanced uh answer should come get month rather than in years\nThat's good you know Trump consequently it\n... or ... said he would get a team and you have a new stadium built you probably could not began playing until two thousand twenty", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "09"}
