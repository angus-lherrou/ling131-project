[noise]\nEight oh five on the big sports show the five fifty to your friend and we see ... with you\nAll coming up on about a nine hours or so removed from the cardinals farewell press conference to two thousand and Eighteen John Jose like meeting with media earlier today in a very strange setting where it was\nIt wasn't quite a round table but kind of got to all sit around almost like a dinner table and and talk even though I couldn't hear certain things or couldn't do it it just\nHad a strange flow to it compared to the normal press conference setting that we've seen a basically as long as I've been covering the team which is about seven or eight years\nWell they wanted they wanted a winter meetings field\nWhich I get winter meetings if you go cover it it's very informal it's just basically talking ball\nUm there's just the problem is yes many folks who want to know about the cardinals at the end of the season that it was probably a little bit too big of a crowd\nI'm tired folks ... ask them why it wasn't live stream why wasn't broadcast that was the conditions that by the cardinals so ... people are wondering about that that was something that they\nAsked no last year we know tweeting no no obviously all the updates went up afterwards you have your hearing Sam now you're seeing video now\nBut uh they didn't want to broadcast live which I'll actually okay with that because it\nIt's conducive to conversation it leads to a bad interview oftentimes with everybody in there trying to tweet and talk and you know not pay attention to to get the news out I almost prefer an embargo until they leave the room and it's a free for all um because I think it leads to a better\nI'm a better conversation so I'm good with that but ultimately like it was what we wanted we wanted to ask every question from from a to Z and we got a chance to do that what about Carson Kelly what about you\nKnow what about Dexter Fowler ... which positions D.C be insecure do you think you need a starting pitcher what do you do with what about ... tremor I don't\nThink we got to use it every question I don't think we've got ... I don't I don't think there was a question about great Garcia\n\nIs he wasn't that at ... at the top of my [laughter] I'm just saying there's I I don't remember hearing about Greg or maybe a couple other ... other than that yeah every but\nWhat about ... what about Dakota huts water by this\nGuy I mean we basically went through the whole roster and asked for the think I Would have made a lot quicker just does it go down the line just have a roster sitting in front of your address each and every player a down the line but picture stuff you never know where that is conversations are going to go\nLook I I'll be honest when when the question about ... to ask a kind of roll my eyes but I look like a dummy because ... made it sound like there might be something there he says look I understand that Rick series about this\n... a hundred percent committed to it I usually don't comment on free agents but because this guy is basically an employee of mine I Can't comment and says he didn't he didn't talk to him soon so you know I've been to ... idea ... making\nHe didn't talk to him soon so you know I've been to ... idea of ... making a comeback with the cardinals but most not and he has his opinion matters a lot more than mine\nAnd here's the deal it's it's funny because you think of a a need that the cardinals have\nToppled the list is left handed release so up there is any possibility that Rick could get a less the out the cardinals would be a pretty foolish not to ah the kind of see we'll see what see what's there\nI'll say this if I had to bed at my my house on who's going to get this does hit or out in my options are ... our Brett Cecil now getting ill side says I mean he's on the team so I Can't ...\nIt's a story state of affairs but ... you know big picture plans cheer for the off season here's mo\nYou know overall as as we look to this this off season we are ah [noise]\nWe know we have to be engaged we know we have to uh [noise]\nWe'll focus on ways to to truly improve this club or\nWhen you look at that some of the past offseason [laughter]\nDefinitely had some swing and Mrs we've definitely had some\nSuccesses but we've got to find a way to get over that because as I stated to open this we knew eighties we now know it was not good enough that our division doesn't look like it's going to get a week or so I'm going to require both investment and intelligence to give us or that\nAre they going to adapt are they going to try to do the same thing and hope that that other teams fall off and they're kind of persistent said he

depending on how aggressive the cardinals are a lot has been made okay how aggressive would then be with what's happened not\nToo far behind in the rearview mirror would pass family in free agency affect what mole and Mr do it and the cardinals do this off season\nNot really I think that narrative is happened quite a bit where where people\nYou look at some of the investments we've made and now he does that mean we world [noise]\nI don't think that's the way we're doing it um [noise]\nYou know when you when you think back to those moments in time\nNot many people say those are just dumb move\nThey just didn't work out and you don't have we given up on on seesaw in Fowler\nThe answer's no there's there's still time to sort of or some of this out now\nDoes that mean you won't see something dramatic happen between now and February you know putting anything off the table but [noise]\nYou know I think you know if our specific you know there are examples of players that have had\nThe types of careers he's had and then\nA little bit of a downward them back up so\nYou know I really felt like [noise]\nRight before he was injured actually that that night he got injured\nHe was getting to a point\nZero unfortunately\nI think the team itself so as optimism\nObviously a couple of things that take from that uh the team is\nYou know what they're they're ... they're not going to change their approach because of again ... swings and Mrs [noise] what else do you take from that Dexter Fowler still very much in the mix with this ball club well\nI think the feller thing has reached a point where everybody just here's what they want to hear 'em because I was getting feedback from people there going oh my God I Can't believe they committed the foul or that he's going to be back and it's like the way I read that was\nI don't know what they what people want the cardinals to say about Dexter Fowler right now\nHe's got unfolded trait clause is owed fifty million dollars\nNo one wants to trade for him he's not even healthy hasn't been cleared for baseball I write it does the cardinals no good to come out today and say it extra power it's not going to be a part of this anybody wants trade form I mean come on people like wake up like yeah Dexter Fowler could be a part of this team next year\nAlso he could be moved if he does something during spring training that read\nBy idolizes his trade interests when those elect talks about making out the roster for next season and pencil and not pin\nHe's talking about right field being a part of that he's talking about you know we also went on to say that we need to see a lot from extra fellow that's often feel comfortable about banking on him that he ... he goes to spring training and torches everything and he's and he looks great and the cardinals you know aren't interested in trading him because they don't feel like they can get you\nKnow what they could get for they're not they're not completely off texture but I don't I'm not buying that they're just all in on him being the starting right fielder next year either I think they're a spot where they of course want whether they want to keep them or trade him it's still better for them if he if he believes that he's got a spot to play for and he ...\nStill better for them if he if he believes that he's got a spot to play for and he ... and comes back and plays well because even if they are going to move and it makes it easier there's no point today and saying I don't see how this is going to work with our that's the last thing that you won't salaries you are right now so I just don't know like most said it when he said\nWe look at their main allies certainly on a roster at this point that also makes it hard for an upgrade and we know we need to upgrade\nTo me third base in right field or the easiest spots we're not talking pitch and talked to position players it's third base in right field so third base is probably the easiest 'em right field might be the best fit if you're going to go heavy for for one of these star free agents and Harper um but you know to me right field is no way set in stone\nRight now I wasn't really surprised by anything he said because I don't know what else you're supposed to say at this point\nBut you're absolutely right and it's this this is a guy that you've got on your day he's occupying a spot for for better or for worse you have them and I think there's\nIf you're the cardinals you gotta hope he can give you something he's another one of these pieces where ... ... even if you I mean even if he goes out and you know has a you know tears it up in spring training teams aren't\nLooking Jean ... there is no team right now sitting in their front office or you know what we really need in older\nOutfielder that can't really feel this position anymore\nDoesn't really run like a used to and you still got three years old to image somewhat sixty million dollars is a guy we really want or need even if it goes on hits five hundred the first few weeks of spring training the cardinals aren't going to have any takers for this guy\nWell the way that deal works as you go to spring training he proved he's helped these playing well boom somebody loses an outfielder there somebody's hurting for a major league outfielder that's when that deal happen I mean these these things happen um we've seen the cardinals have to do the same thing remember when\nWhen they got ... to ... in that way I mean these people get hurt at spring training that to make trades to fill a spot that's how that\nCould happen again I'm not saying the cardinals are are trying to convince they have to move valor but I'm saying is I don't know that they're convinced they have to start them either I think the right now they're realizing we only really have one card to play here\nAnd it's to be optimistic about Dexter season because there's no other option and that's the one they're playing so to me I wasn't surprised by anything they said I Would have been more surprised if motive came out today and said we got to get rid of the guy frightening to me is like well then you should have just paid him to leave because now you're ... you're not you're not going to get\nYou know anything for him the last thing you want to do is tell everybody in the league but you're you have no interest in having this guy and I I think there is interest I think they hope he comes back in ... they hope he's a part of this he had a good year the year before last year\nI mean so so we're not talking about guys bin ... who's been bad since he came here you had one good year hit one very bad year a very bad year and now there are questions of whether or not he can be healthy to me that was the most interesting thing that was set in the press or is that he hadn't been cleared for baseball activities that's going to be a question about this this is he able to be\nReady yeah here's a here's ... recovery\nShould have a better answer for that early November ah put him in terms of of\nUm he has not been clear for ... I've been to I think that's something that by early November we should have a better gauge of and that too could affect you know how we think about that spot or or how we think about the future it\nJust complicates matters greatly ban is where we can talk until we're blue in the face about harbor harbor harbor but whether we want to admit it or not this this is this is the major stumbling block I Believe to the cardinals bean able having the ability to do are we talking about take that next step\nFather's a a a huge huge part of it and it's just uh I I don't see I don't see any easy out there for this team uh I I think what would be the the shocker of all shocker ... is to see them move on Harper when there's while\nThe extra situation would still be on ... yes I think Ben ... as we heard right there if they're going to get Harper it would be with the extra situation still up in the air because I think we could all assume he's still on this roster come spring training right\nWell yeah I don't see any ways not yeah at this point but I also don't know that\n\nThe presence of that situation keeps you from going after player you'd have identified as who can who can be the cornerstone piece of this team for a long time\nSomething in the car down and never done ... finds a way no you're right you never have too much of it and there's nothing there's nothing that says that ... being overpaid fourth outfielder\nUm look everyone who's ready to anoint Tyler O'Neill come on he struck out forty percent of the time last year and maybe he's the next the next best thing but but but I'm not ready to say I feel comfortable with him being a starting right fielder either to meet ... news the perfect fourth outfielder I don't I'm not ready to say that feel confident with him being the guy at either so\nIt would be it would be really now look if you're going to find a way to go out and get a mega third third baseman and make some other ... like I'm not I think people think that I'm just harbor but they don't get are pretty terrible loss no not at all\nI'm saying that if they but if they stop if they let the Fowler situation stop them from upgrading position\nAnd then it doesn't work\nThen we're talking about the same stuff that we talked about in this press conference today where where they settled\nAnd all of a sudden you know the bottom could drop out in the ... so much of what is now it Fowler is too hard to move and you feel like you your company can bounce back okay I just I then I look after that and then okay what are you gonna do elsewhere because here's the thing is you're\nYou're the most part committed ... called the longest second base Matt carpenter is going to have to play somewhere so it's either a third base or first base you're committed to the most part to pull the young shortstop the audience is not going anywhere Harris invaders committed to in center field\nI Am a veteran must be in the long term homeless has America's veterans face challenges ... there might be with family to support to get back home ... helps veterans of every generation give them benefits they burned I'm a veteran when I got out I thought well you know are we safe\nSo veterans can reach victories great and small\nVictory was fined ... ... we are joined um human again\nAboard more victories for veterans go to ... or\nBack to the big sport show on on like five fifty Katie R. S. [noise]\nDo you have any idea you'd have biggie bringing into a segment tonight Ben\nI'm all about it I'm far does march all one of my favorite movies yeah\nA lot of big in that one hardball or Moneyball\nHardball does in the heck yeah all the time or gee maybe R. I. P. baby\nLouise going to watch that one I think it's only ... issue no hair you up on that you're a jerk or now they\nCan't come in my opinion Reeves best performance of his career forget the matrix it's replacements and hard ball\nWhat about bill and Ted's excellent adventure that you're at that come on now that's that's old school that's like a U.S that's uh something new and gardener\n[laughter]\nGuilty as charged I'm All right let's let's circle\nBack here to old Marcel ozone and we mentioned at the uh the shoulder injury it's still an issue how big of an issue was it for oh sooner this year here's mo\nShoulder issue comes up a lot when we were we talk but I still don't know the answer how much a truly effective because when you ask them so it's not really but\nI Do think like when we acquired ozone and we knew we were getting off a career right I mean so\nWas I going to be some level of regression to the mean I think the answer is probably\nNow when you look at him entering a this next year you're hoping maybe you might see a balance towards\nThe other way but I think you know he didn't affective player\nHe he he is\nA very very good hitter\nUm I think defensively he did create a level of a liability for us because of his inability to throw\nYou know I think it's really incumbent upon him\nTo spend this off season being diligent about\nPutting his shoulder in a position where they can be strengthened\nYou know we can we can show you where the water is but we can't make a drink and I think in his case he's going to have to take that very seriously\nPlaces to do that whether it's in the DR Miami Jupiter wherever he'd like to do it but eventually he has to show off\nIts funny ... because we we do something we really weren't aware of until the kind of get this spring training what what's wrong with his shoulder and you know here we are some seven months later\nAnd it's still a mystery is this is this is wild well\nIt's I don't know that it's as big of a mystery of the cardinals made it out to be during the\nSeason I think I think now they're being very candid about it and I think part of that comes from them getting tired of being blamed for for it all see yeah I'm basically\nMost said today what had been hinted at\nThroughout the season that the cardinals identified an issue here saw was causing problems try to you know back him off at spring training to deal with it it didn't get better went to them as it was getting worse and said hey let's let's try to do something here and and those who knows spent the whole season basically brushing everyone away\nTelling people I'm fine I'll play through it ended up a couple of spikes\nIn performance that I guess you know encouraged enough folks that they let him kind of dictate what he needed it wasn't until the team won out west\nTo California and really I think you know cardinals fans like to beat up Scott Boris but Boris helped the team this year by getting to a unit and saying look man sometimes outright with you here's video house screwed up your swing is\nLet's get this checked out and for whatever reason that clicked any day and and got the shot and we saw what he did after that now\nTo me the question is what happens now because by that point his season was already pretty marred by this um you know and really to me the shoulder I don't know how much you can see the show I don't know how to what extent the shoulder wasn't a huge factor in this because he was heading\nHe just wasn't hitting with power he wasn't getting balls off the ground to the contact was there the exit velocity was there all the things that you look for in a guy who's who's losing power he had um he had the right stuff the ball just wasn't leaving his bat the same the swing wasn't\nThe same and that to me he's clearly because of the shoulder I don't I'm not in his body I don't know what he feels and I think most making that point like\nYou don't have a guy who's telling you what do you feel that we don't have a guy who's raising up his own flag and then when you go to him and say this doesn't look right he's he's not embracing the the feedback or doesn't want to see the treatment and there's only so much\nYou can do know contrary to popular belief you can't strap these guys down on treatment tables and go to work on behalf of it has to be a two way street I think the cardinals felt like that a road blocks for a lot of the season now the spin a forward and it's what do they do to get this guy right\nAnd there's a few factors in play here\nPart of this big picture the cardinals mode talked a lot today about doing things with all the players this off season they usually give them some things to work on in the off season now that it's going to be they can't make it mandatory as much as they would like to you but there's going to be some accountability here on what they are expected to do between now and the start of spring training\nYou got the here it is kind of laid it out maybe goals for for each and every player here's mo\nWeek we sort of understand all these little\nThings each individual may need to address whether it's from the baseball side whether it's from the medical side whether it's from the mental side whatever those are\nOur goal is by November one to be able to present every player [noise]\nA a list of of areas that they need to focus on so called middle of February it's not like hey did you do that\nThe the accountability of this off season is is going to be very real\nAnd our expectation\nThe of this off season is is going to be very real\nAnd our expectations are are going to be very clear\nAnd so when you were asking about someone specifically like Cold War\nHis leg issues will be addressed this off season now again we can\nSuggest or tell you to do whatever we think you need to do but you have to have buy in\nAnd and you have to feel it's going to help you\nWhen we present and position is our our our hope for for the game is that [noise]\nMiddle of February we can hit the ground running and not have that moment of we gotta catch off\nI'm an example that a lot of ways is is like as if when you think about last year we had a limit throws in spring training we had to really sort of limit outfield drills because we didn't want to stay\nPut him in a worse fought him and be just over expose them to to somewhere where he's going to take a major step backward so if we can handle that between now and February that I think you are level of success will be higher than that\n[noise] so what do you make out of that I think it's the story of the day\nUm because it's a shift in approach the cardinals are now saying we're going to try to maximize and all season to the point that it's not guy show up at spring training we find out oh something's wrong we spent the off season taking what's wrong and trying to fix it so we hit the ground running\nWhen we get there and and it's going to open up a\nWorld of possibilities now they're going to they're going to have to get by in and it's going to be really fascinating and I wonder too as more and more team start to do this kind of stuff if I'm\nAt the players union doesn't start barking a little bit yeah because the colonel's can't make things mandatory yet they you know playing time first opportunity like all these things factor into this some guys don't aren't going to have anything\nUm you know some guys are told hey you're good some got just a hey this was a problem last year let's set up some things for you to work on and that's always been the case but now there's going to be accountability that was going to be a ... with us or hey let's come come check in and make it let's make sure you've done this um so that's going to be a fascinating\nConversation as to how players respond\nUm I think I think you could see some discussion about this being a new trend among teams I'm you know it's going to be not just baseball performance either it's not just going to be hey work on your pick off news it's not just going to it could be hey you need to get with a you know you need to get with a\nMental coach on some stuff here ... Fowler talked about he thinks the biggest reason for his struggles a season was mental health um you know there are ways of players can can work on strengthening that aspect of the game it's a huge part of the game then nobody talks about for those Luna with Carlos Martinez is going to be physical therapy or they get their bodies in shape how they get right\nMost talked about being glad that Carlos was going to stay in St Louis his off season because they could have a closer monitor over his treatment over his recovery and to me it's like almost disappointing you're listening that as a positive because this guy to the point that career where\nIf he's not in St Louis he's not going to be doing the right things to to get to get right to be the starter next season I mean it's it's almost like you're pulling your hair out at this point but it does seem like they have identified this as a weakness our guys are showing up not fully ready to roll and we're going to fix that now\nI'm now he would say don't look at it as a weakness look at it as a what could be a strength but there's a reason they're paying attention to it they've identified as something they want to get better at it and that's usually because they're not good at it enough\nAre scheduled to sit out and be eligible next season but there are a lot of these transfers that are getting waivers and uh and finding their eligibility immediately and cons on Martin\nDid tell the folks today in fact been told us last I Can't remember been told us on the air and not have been told us he had been in contact with kinds of trying to get some insight on a on finding that waiver well indeed ... has and they're going to try to get the Smith\nOn a on finding that waiver well indeed ... has and they're going to try to get the Smith Brothers again not brothers but they're going to try to get the Smiths eligible immediately and and even\nThat would change was use fortunes it would be a complete one eighty because I I the concern right now for the tigers backward and your ability to score and the ... and your ability to play make in the back court maybe\nJohn the reporter can go out there and an average of double double every night but it might not be enough\nDon't you think that's why he's not first team policy see 'cause if\nHe was he would probably been a top a first round pick last year by most yes some up by most people's projections or a second round pick early second ... so you would think he'd be a first first team player if if everything around the team was solid which I don't think the point guards are\nRight oh and like I said that the guys that made first team are also really good and and I said silver South Carolina there picked eleven gathered for Arkansas either pick tense so it's not it's not as if those guys got the nod because they're going to play on really good teams that got the not because they're really good players John ... I'm I'm not sure\nWhat his numbers will look like here's the thing\nHere would be my dream line for John ... at the end of the year if he plays every game let's call Thirteen points per game let's go nine rebounds per game and let's do it well let's keep going for us is\nLet's go two blocks let's go one steel\nHeat is your prototypical stat sheet stuffer but I don't see him as somebody that night in night out going to lead this team in scoring and I think that's always what we kind of folk ... focus on at first and we need to focus on it for this team because there isn't that instant\nGuy who stands out who's going to be the focal point\nOf this office I just I think if if he could average like say six ... six us as a game that would be interesting yeah I'd take six that means he's passing of all people are open and they're making their shots which like last year wasn't always the case with people making shots outside of cash Robertson and Barnett\nAnd I see him being like high fit like really high efficiency sixty percent feel go percentage\nHopefully improved and he was pretty good at the free throw line last year anyway but you know he can shoot it obviously from beyond the are key should teach checks off every single box and that's why John ...\nIs going to be highly sought after in the NBA or is it was really curious about this year in in watching college troops are teams and ... sort of one of these teams will Tillman too and and and not so much with John tape because he's a\nHe's got every other aspect of his game going except maybe he doesn't have the handle\nBut that's all these\nPosition let's basketball it is it's the talk of of of the troops to go along with the trial and the FBI or let's say each and all and all of that and it's just basketball in general these teams that stockpile\nPrototypical begs the six nine six ten guys you can eat always say you have to have some sort of size two in college basketball and win basketball at any level and that's obviously still true but if you're only stockpiling guys\nThat all they can do is rebound and ... and and if those [laughter] I just wonder\nWhat happens with those guys with we heard remember Tyler Davis Texas seeing him their big center last year seven feet tall left early didn't get drafted didn't get ... I think he had been feet\nTall I think he has I think he had some off the field trouble though 'cause I ... I Believe he signed with the Celtics and he didn't report or something like that something very strange\nYou know you're right but that easy and he's just one example though there's a litany of guys that left early last year that I use prototypical big that don't\nTranslate to today's NBA the question is for me do they still translate to today's college basketball and for the teams that go position was slew is going to be a very interesting case the thing with flu is they've just got athletic freaks and ...\nAnd early on it but it's ... I don't think anybody's confused medium for your prototypical big key is just a freak athlete what\nWe've talked a lot about that strengthens loose front court how well how much does that really matter in today's game if you play it you know play teams that are going a one in four out it\n... the landscape has changed and I want to see how much it's changed I'm not ready to go all in on this yet but I'm very curious to see how this goes this year but for a guy like giant they he doesn't really fit really any mould because he does all these things well but he's not\nA perimeter guy he's not a handle guys not somebody who's going to bring up the ball I don't think he is yet get his body sculpting I think it's getting that way and let's see what type of player he looks like bought used but getting to your original point what happens if the Smiths play\nSuddenly I think this team could do a lot and then there's less pressure on your ah in Torrance Watson\nAnd uh you know the kid from Chicago pinched in to to be the guys in the ... or get a look at it right now look at your back court those are the guys are going to be leaning on for production and then you're obviously I'm leaning on\nYou know everybody's everybody's favorite a whipping boy there at that point\nAnd it's it it it would she would solve a lot of issues but I don't think anybody can hope for that I don't I don't think that's something that we can call the probability you think Jordan guy starts to sure yeah I think he's your starting point guard and now it is pinch in a just completely\nUh blows away a guy's tearing in the pre season but as bad as pointed out I I've seen it I I ... loves guys he loves joined guy so it would be hard to see him completely phased out but boy he's got to be better than than last year\nIt's hard it's hard to put a lot of pressure on two freshman but I think ... and I'm ... ... to me they're going to be the deciding factor of this team\nQuestion about it I I think Watson if I were if if the Smiths or ineligible let's assume they're not I I think we got we have to be as a long shot right now if they're not eligible\nMy pick would be ... soon as you're leading scorer if John ... is your leading scorer almost wonder if some of his other stats or suffer a little bit and that that would just that would be interesting there and\nI get he's so good to get his game is is so well balanced Watson to me if he's\nIf he's right quick he averaged Fifteen again that's ... that's asking a whole heck of a lot you just don't know but to me he would make the most sense to be your to beer leading score and again Tillman ... does he stay out of ... trouble and in can he be double digit game\nStore with with six or seven rebounds in the defense of go along there's well again and I think most importantly Kim Tillman average north of twenty minutes a game\nThat's the thing candy stay out of style job will stay on the floor he could be a again he is you're more prototypical big but there's a lot of skill they're obviously with a Jeremiah till ...\nBut there's a lot of skill they're obviously with a jury might do that again the zoo number nine in the pre season pool why Britain we usually it's the big sport showing the big five fifty\nK.
