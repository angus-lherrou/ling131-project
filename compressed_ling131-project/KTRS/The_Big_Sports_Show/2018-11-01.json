the next week we talked about the Seventy ... and they started off their their one in one a really disappointing game begins Columbus and encouraging urging game I Would say against Chicago and now as we said during the six thirty segment\nNow does team duty I think for the first time\nAnd actually from the beginning to it's not like this team was dealing with a rash of injuries they've had some guys that are deemed up but now you're as whole as you've been and I think they're out of excuses so it's it's as they say it's\nPut up or shut up time it certainly is and and really as you point out compared to last year the ... it has been just bumps and bruises now for to do\nA out at least a couple of weeks may maybe longer but other than that really I mean last year you you didn't see boom

Mike yo and fabric progress to show me a lot of\nRacial ... or um Billy wisely wise but more importantly just that I always do whatever\nIt is a this is a a a big deal J. T. what what do you expect to see from fabric here in the in the early portions who's returned\nAnd I'm sure it will be an emotional moment for him when he steps out on that I set Vegas I'm sure that they fix the crowd at the enterprise center will\nWill give them up a a a warm warm welcome but\nYou know you play three days in a tree games excuse me in five days in San Antonio so a pretty hefty\nIn a three games excuse me in five days in San Antonio so a pretty hefty schedule I think he said he average about Ninety minutes\nAnd he said no sore and us at all after any of that and that was the problem that's been the problem all of camp the knees felt fine he is you can tell he's moving while but maybe it's because he he hasn't played in game action and that is you can practice all you want to just those movements the shark movements in game action you've got to get in game shape and\nHe had all kinds of like hip growing up back injury and maybe a little bit subconsciously over compensating to protect the needy or whatever but he came out of the San Antonio stretch fine he said he scored a goal and uh he's he'll start out on the fourth line today in practice they had a ...\nRobert Thomas and Sundquist and so I think that's perfect for him as he starts ... you don't want to rush of ... just throwing a after barely playing for nearly two years is okay if you're going to get a Nineteen Minutes tonight so\nUh you know maybe gets eight nine ten minutes or they've got ... if if there's any kind of short in this or not they can they can send them off the next game or whatever but that that that's how they're gonna they're they're going to start out as with ... on the fourth line and\nAt the sooner or later you you know if\nIf he returns to being the Robbie fabric that the blues fans and blues coaches know he'll he'll be you know he's got top six talent of of course he does but uh\nUh we don't know if we're going to see that right away you know again even ever ever ever that's that's a that's a great great point and and and uh\nIn the world of football and they say you're usually it's the year after you come back we're you're fully back maybe that'll be the case with him but but we'll see maybe he'll surprise us but yeah they're going to take it slowly fourth line and then take it from there that's a that's a heck of a fourth line talent even if he's eighty percent of old Robbie fabric\nThe fabric of the only one back show ... ... ... on what to expect from the returning players from injury\nTo judge that are certainly there's questions were the same time you're not going to know until you get the men and the longer you wait garter gifts so [noise] um [noise] I Will say that [noise]\nIt's it's a first off as a coach [laughter]\nI Know that there are not necessarily going to be at the level that I remember them or that are that I Know that they're capable of it goes off to expect that I'm Out quickly they can get back there is really going on on how quickly we get them knocking on the line up and get the ... and get them working with a group and get them ...\nIt's a it's going to be time hopefully not too much time but just having them back and being able to manage their time on the ice that that'll you know take some creative touch maybe by yo tomorrow night but just having them there it's it's a plus for this club\nAnd the answer to that you just played for you to question to me it's like oh you're a little concerned about just say ... you want to look at all these guys are healthy but\nJust not going to throw two or three guys in at the same time who haven't played a game all season and here you are you going to play team like Vegas played twelve games already so you've got to be mindful of that\nAnd but then again is as Michael said you've got to get them you've got to get them out there but yeah you do not have that pressure social cough I think\nWhile establishes a fourth line guy and he's a guy who recall from last year he runs around like his hairs on fire I mean he'll she's fast skaters he'll run into the players by I think he plays harder than his body the guys always hurt so\nAgain as you think about things Robert Thomas now we're six games he's got three more before you burn the richer ear so to speak and so what if you send Thomas to junior hockey and you can't touch them the rest of the season at least until the junior hockey season's over\nAnd you get such Gulf author and he gets hurting two weeks than it is and you know he's coming back from a a a concussion he hadn't training in the summer when he got got hit in the ear where the puck if you can imagine if you can imagine that but it's good to have ... he's the guy\nHe thinks that the the good home plate on fire you don't notice them because they're they're not messing up and get your gutters and play the game ... do well I don't know well that's the ... you know he's not flashy guy but but very steady so it's great to

PGA Championship and in Europe when they're competing now against those events those those European events look more and more interesting not only to European players but I think they probably would be a little more interesting to American players\nAnd so now you can start seeing the possibilities of a world tour coming about between what's hoped going on in\nIn Europe where they have a focus of\nThe middle east events than they have a focus kind of like in in the summer right around ... be a open championship or you have the Irish are open and you got the scholarship and then you've got you got the\nBritish Open to the open championship then all of a sudden you have that whole schedule after the fed ex cop where there's some great events including the b._m._w. PJ and then they have their finish which is a race should if I were to later in the season so now the sudden you have four distinct properties or sections of the schedule where\nYou can get your European players to come back and also American players and you can start seeing the inclines I think of how a world tour could come about\nYou know using a world tour\nA Greg Norman as I recall probably Twenty years ago maybe even more ah that was his vision is what Greg Norman was hoping for a what we're seeing possibly the genesis of now\nWell I think Greg Norman had the idea that would make sense to have all the great players playing together on a regular basis um\nOutside of that I got to be honest with you I don't think we really saw much more of what Greg Norman's vision was I mean the idea of having great players playing together always sounded great but you know it was very hard\nTo kind of come about I mean that was so long to go to where we are today I think the idea or the concept of what Greg was thinking is certainly something that I think we'll see you know you have to remember we got TV deals and everything else but the next TV deals going to come up pretty soon\nI Would think by the end of twenty thirty at the very least we will see some type of world tour incorporating the world golf championships the majors and that obviously probably four or five six events both sides and um but you have to get the players on sign off on that and you know not every player is gonna make a world tour of a better world golf championship event and so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Big Sports Show", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "01"}
