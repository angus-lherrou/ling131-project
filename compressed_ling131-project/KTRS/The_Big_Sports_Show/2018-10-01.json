{"month": "10", "state": "MO", "station": "KTRS", "content": "They would be the brewers and by the way that was it regularly [noise] not at Miller Park reading there were a ton of brewer fans that made that trip down south turned in Miller Park south to be honest with you know it's good I like it\nLoud loud loud and Milwaukee the national league central division champions that's tie breaker game number one tie breaker game number two Dodgers and Iraqis and again ending moments ago\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nSix\nStraight ... an hour west champions that doesn't sound right doesn't\nThat doesn't mean they were educated as the giants have been made it out there it's been been incredible and like the two guys who did homers today Muncie who you've never heard of and now\nYou know uh what's the total number I'm ... thirty five in just a few hundred of bats and bell injure hits his twenty fifth home run and when you start naming off star Dodgers what does she come up six eight\nOr you know and maybe having better years in some of the guys you would name ahead of him but it just goes to show you how deep they've become\nThey that wind up is as you know here's the thing we talk and we will talk a ton about the cardinals and the seven o'clock hour but we're rattling off you know brewers\nCubs Dodgers Rockies all these teams have lineups one through a veteran posing\nAnd the cubs lined up it's not always been consistent and productive this year but there are names up and down that you worry about in that line up on like a team here in St Louis but that dodge ram and look at how weak the weak has just then he did it here in ... and and and that\nIt was maybe most noticeable in that run here in St Louis rewrite from home run game a what a day or two after the to whom one game\nPer week has stayed on fire for LA well\nWhat I like about Dave Roberts what he's done with a a true wildcard in week when he's not acting right or playing right or just simply in a slow he don't plan\nYou should just but I don't know it helps when you've got guys who can who can fill in that helps a whole lot and if he's doing something to goofy you know sitting down and if he's not but if he's just okay you know intimate two of them said let's Robert Robert doesn't have to play the\nI got to keep my guys happy game\nTreat 'em like grownups they act like grownups then everything will be fine if you don't act like growing up so I don't care and he's a [noise] when you're handling a group like that when you started to wonder with like the cubs in them in particular can you have too much talent I Know that\nSounds like she more Amish but\nI think it was made up or did he did yeah but\nBut trying to juggle guys a for the most productivity is one thing but to keep that many guys happy and focused and it will hold another deal and somehow they done it to this point in in in LA and I really think Chicago too\nAnd he he's slowly bounce back after you know just really perplexing seasons in Fifteen and sixteen were ... ... she was writing the bench most of the season is now two years in a row where he's starting to look more like ... we saw in Thirteen and fourteen but they don't\nBe don't\nPlaced in the middle of the line at the hip six seven eight and the reason a lot of you know\nTwenty three home runs coming off of twenty eight home runs season\nThis is about where they thought he might be maybe a little bit below but he's still just twenty seven in the skills remembered the stonewall skills are ... are exceptional and and again he's just one piece to the puzzle for the Dodgers right I ask you this earlier\nOff the air looking at these four teams planting tie breaker games today and I asked you could you see a scenario where any of the four make the world series you answer ... my answer ... even the two teams playing them are in the wild card game I could see the Rockies or the cubs absolutely get\nThere either one of them could have one that won the game today or or ... or could win a a game any given game against anybody there that talented and ... and here's the other key the one the one team that would have the the most difficult time\nOut of the for an uncle in reverse shorter forth for Trump's bullpen served the Dodgers bullpen then the Rockies rotation\nMaybe a little bit the most complete team might be the brewers but they've got a great bullpen so the gene the two teams with the better both ends I think would maybe have the best chance but I wouldn't bet it I wouldn't bet on any of them but also closer too many variables and I don't like the action anyway\nBut wherever we talked to a couple of weeks ago the the odds for the brewers in the Rockies wearing like the twenty to one change I think we both wanted they these are two teams that could get there and the Rockies are going to have a tougher time now having a plan to walk hurricane tomorrow then Milwaukee but both those teams exceptional my point being\nThe cardinals got to Saturday with a chance to still get in\nI Would not have said the same thing if they somehow found their way to today and a tie breaking game I Would not have said the cardinals had the chance of the world series use other fourteen different me a\nDifferent reason because they didn't they do play\nTheir position player talent is not as good\nThe ... the rosters is not an good\nTurtles muddy a missile other duties with Carlos ... Martinez as a closer\nI think you could have set up your bullpen and your rotation to compete\nI think arm for arm you get as much talent as any of the teams that are in I'm not saying are necessarily better today but I'm Talking about talented arms\nI think one through whatever you want to call your staff twelve let's say the ... one through twelve as talented of arms is any of those playoff teams\nI I agree now your election experience and so you might not take you know\nOur guy the say\nDakota Hudson over somebody off the Rockies who's having a good year but you might not trade Dakota Hudson for that guy either because of his future that's my point\nThe last two weeks of the cardinals as strange as it is to say their strength was starting pitching again was at the beginning of the year it wasn't so for a long time the season but this last week week and a half the cardinal strengths\nWere starting pitching from Michael is on Saturday to Wainwright who's ... Wainwright wasn't great on friday but he gave you a chance at\nTwo to ... does that was the strength of the staff and if they somehow got to a division series I Would have taken my chances there but the staffing again like you said the overall washed her not deep enough for them to legitimately be viewed as a world sees contender even though\nHave you gotten to October head you've gotten there we've seen in the past you always have a chance but it would've been insincere to say the cardinals were on the same level of those four teams playing today they weren't\nNo just sold in some ways despite all of our disappointment relative to those who got in maybe the cardinals over achieved\nI think there's any doubt about it I don't think there's any doubt about it Mac carpenter yesterday after the final lost to the cubs on how the steam compete in the second half\nYou look at every year and there's a lot of people out there a lot of the way meaning named right now I mean sometimes mathematically\nConsidering wary or the first time so I'm proud of the way we did it really happened is they did\nAnd\nThey did really compete in the second half and gave a the cardinals fans a chance I\nI Know some people are disappointed the way this ... and it was totally\nIt was an ugly flood yeah where are you get swept by Milwaukee and ended up dropping to have three to the cubs you wish you would've turned out a little bit differently but I think this team was out numbered at Indian they again they just couldn't really stack up\nThe fact that they got this far to me and we'll talk more about it in the seven o'clock hour\nI Am actually really reaffirmed that my show it was the right guy for the job we can get for the manager of a strategic with things especially this last week you get a lot of ... with a lot of managers but big picture body of work for my ... thumbs up\nDespite some of the things that we may or may not agree on as mistakes or I Would have preferred to do with a different way et cetera et cetera I think that the way the team played I'm\nNot only effort energy but also style specially offensively I think all those things picked up to where people I think rightfully should say yeah this is the right guy\nThink about for the second hour and you can dial the Senate nine six nine Katie arrest rate for one to six on the tax line what this team does what direction should they go in the offseason free agency trade wise what needs to be prioritized and the central division isn't getting any easier\nCertainly something to think about as well it's the big sports show\nFor it and we see by Ramsey he's in our producer Luis in the house as well for seven o'clock hour baseball conversation we love it and a lot to break down for the next several months some basketball news maybe a quick look at the NFL tonight when we come back on the big five fifty K.
