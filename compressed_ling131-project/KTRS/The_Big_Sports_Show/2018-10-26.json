sooner we wanted to do this particular show is we wrap up the season for St Louis ... kind enough to join us here in Studio tonight I Know he'd\nRather be getting ready for the uh the next round of the U.S all playoffs its its coaching Anthony ... coach thanks so much for for joining us I I Know it's a it's been a a while it incredible season a very taxing season because you know you started in March here we are in October\nNow a with a with the season in in the rearview mirror\nScience army no it's been it's been a long year um I mean where would you say season started ... start precision first week in February that arise when you add almost six weeks but I said it's a long time and ah and you're right in saying I Wish we stood and trying to prepare for a conference final but it wasn't so they unfortunately\nAnd coach you know let's start with you know looking back at\nAt the match because you know you go see and\nYou know immediately and it's not something we talked about last week I\nUh you know we we don't like to talk about the injuries kind of heading into the game but certainly we we're mindful of it I Know you were mindful love and whether or not you were going to have wall whether or not you'd have called Greg for the game you don't have a ... and obviously coach that that makes a ton of differences is they were incredible performers for you\nHow did that affect how you gain planned or not having them available\nNow I mean it was obviously a blow not having a cause and more available because as you said the two big place for us this year however going into it we were we were still confident I mean going into it like I said we\nWe prepared as well as what we could do 'em we drew we drew on the on the positives of the two games that we ... and the regular season where we performed really well I'm an August we could have got wins against them um so yeah I mean the mood and accomplish good preparation was good as always and\nUnfortunately we we started off the game really poorly um I mean in big games like that it's it's imperative that you don't make mistakes in the first the first time in the last ten of of each often unfortunately we make\nThey don't make mistakes in the first the first time in the last ten of of each off and unfortunately we make we make some some ... early on in the game we have the red cotton twenty two minutes and I think it was we need to know down with with ten men it was always going to be an uphill struggle\nYasser ... you mentioned the red card ... how ... how do you avoid at that point guys being you know deflated you've got the injuries and now you're you're down on me and the rest of the way out how difficult how difficult the road is it from their uh against against the good team in that position\nYeah well look I'm again like you play against cutting Orange County is going to be tough with eleven of ... and so I'm like I said go conceding the pulled all that he wasn't was an ideal and then you've got the right cod and then you're thinking okay well let's try and keep it tied for as long as we can even get to half time\nUm again I was just ... we we managed to get through to ... to know and\nAnd we try to be as positive as possible with the prize because again they have shown all year that they they can handle it best a um and they can bounce back when things don't go our way and an generally we we we still felt like the game was over because I think if we said the ... when he got another go back\nTo make it to one you never know how you're going to respond um it was a plan that if we got to sixty sixty five minutes we're going to try and sweet the formation of throwing extra mount up top because we knew we have to try and be ... if I'm unfortunately within a couple of minutes of making that change that I\nGo to a counterattack and then again in five minutes later the same thing so again it ... it was a really really disappointed and said well I think it's been a good season\nNo question about it a breakthrough season for St Louis F. C. making it into the U.S up playoffs coach ... your message to the team immediately after the game what what was it\nThere yeah it was it was for them to keep their heads held high because again and I said this to them is that they've been part of a historic season is the first\nEver St Louis ... so I wanted to make sure that they understood how well they've done and how proud I was of them um for what we'd accomplished this year but at the same time I made sure that they they understood the next day we want to be bats are in every facet I'm an obviously this\nIt's inevitable is going to be changes to the rest of 'em but for the players to understand obviously the ones that are coming back um that we would not just going to be happy to sell for a for a position we want to we want to push on and we want to get better and hopefully finished higher up the table in an office of another playoff um stuff\nCompanies progress a little bit times or and you saw in the second off once you go into a rhythm it was dangerous and many\nHe has a really good understanding of of picking up ... positions in between the lines in ... he receives the boat on the back for it looks to go forward and because if I'm really good gold against Vegas and then probably should've out a few more and and I again it's something that he's going to have to look to build on improve the twenty ninth to any support activity pace\nCoaching a lot of people were thrilled to see see him think come back to St Louis used recently honored by the St Louis soccer hall of fame what did what did he brings your club\nSounds are fantastic later I'm a from day one he realized the obviously coming back home to apply um and what was really a new team was so many faces the I didn't know each other ... he was almost gonna be I'm going to be the glue that tried to hold everybody together and um I'm from a leadership standpoint\nUm what we are sort of and we'd go um leads not just by woods but by his actions again similar to Louis in a way which is a fantastic professional\nUm treats every day like it's his last I'm going to somebody you want to build a team around in on on the field was was a model of consistency\nAbout Tony walls and we certainly seemed to mention his name a lot especially down the stretch\nYeah I think Tony out a strong finish the season obviously missed a large portion um with with the injury against somebody else who um it was missing alot which which was an audio but ... and plays right by places and it would fail to I'm under the age of\nOne of our favorite guys to talk to his Austin Marts in Austin a injured for for much of the year he was able to battle back a recover you sort of pick your spots for him at times he brought a lot of speed to the to the equation what was uh what was Austin's a biggest contribution in your mind\nI think you look at Austin and obviously the the first thing that strikes you as is explosive nice I think he instructs fair and to to defend is because of out quick here so he allows you to\nTo stretch the opposition which opens up host or for the place to get into the game and start it off the season strong um unfortunately then obviously got the hip injury and now the surgery and amassed a large portion and then comes back at the end earlier than what we thought he was going to come back so it was a big bonus\nBut then I'm ... out a little bit of of an up and down period I Would say at the end but that was that was to be expected we didn't expect him to come back and hit the ground running when you're out for four or five months or whatever he was it's it's difficult to kind of get straight into a rhythm ... again a still contribution is just against Reno for called ... that turned out to be a huge three points\nThe the end of September and into October coach it did look like that was a point where uh that you had just about your entire roster at your disposal in ... and you mentioned a second ago\nSome of the guy's a you know like a lead better that utilize off the bench ... was was that as confident as you were with being able to deploy certain ...\nAnd she was was that as confident as you were with being able to deploy certain pieces and almost certain deploy certain lineups depending on the match up with like mid to late September at\nThat point yeah I think at that point when we out every body healthy and we ... um three games a week so to speak with Saturday Wednesday Saturday and travel yeah um it was obviously very helpful because we are able to row type people in\nAnd we knew we had we had a strong ... and I know I said it from the ... on on a certain coaches have what they would call the first Lebanon second eleven that was never that was never in my mind I always felt like we are to a ... that we knew that whoever wins and could do a good job and\nI'm a again having not strength and that was a very opaque starts making the playoffs\n... you're a goalkeeper as he injured at the start then really seem to come on as the season progressed\nYet again and I seem to be talking about these players growing up from injuries alone I mean he obviously out to the surgery and the off season and I missed the the the style of the year and and came into the line up again was probably a little bit up and down I'm going to be the first to admit ...\nBy the end of the stage and go into a rhythm and was playing really well and um again real real ... somebody's everybody place to have with us\nCould you have to appeal is with us here on the big five fifty Katie arrest for a few more minutes coaches we start to look ahead a little bit here what have you guys been doing this week at the park is as you've been sort of begin the off season\nI think the uh the initial part of the week uh for me anyway was was getting over the disappointment of the Orange County game I mean it still feels a little bit rolling out to be honest with you but it like I said it took me a couple of days to really get over it\nUm and then we're review and reflect upon the season and what was good uh what needs to be back to what can we do as a staff um to make sure that we are better prepared next year I'm\nOn that now originally we were going through um a lot of meat and stuff means playmates and I'm just to clarify everybody's future so we can have a little bit closer on the twenty eight days and then I'm an ... next week will really be honing in on recruitment and what pieces can weigh up to the group to to improve us some ...\n... what's what's your we mentioned the or the message to the team after the game what now is the message to the players as you mentioned you start to meet with them\nTomorrow what uh what what sort of words and and and maybe game plans do you want to put in their minds as as they may be start to head off and go their separate ways a is as again they're off season begins as well\nYeah I mean we'll we'll scheduling me in that we can I can be a long day tomorrow we're going to meet with everybody I'm stuck in a in the morning I woke up the rice roots around five tomorrow even so it's going to be a long day but I'm One of the ... the biggest basis for mayor of of being a head coach and being a manager is is the communication with the players and I'm being honest with them and given them good feedback\nSo rarely tomorrow will be to clarify that future I'm going to give anything away on the radio butter will will be given them decisions on whether they're going to be staying on some of them have options um others are our contract so we we really want to make sure that it's on they walk out the door they know they know the situation they know whether they're going to be studying whether they'd be going whether we're going to be\nTrying to renegotiate contracts um but then also like I said give them honest feedback on on the season and\nWhether they stay in a weather that going to try and help them get back to move in full with um the ones that stay in will\nWill will stay in touch with them closely over the off season will give them a training program so that when they come back in pre season that fair and they're ready to go\nOur ... were you will you watch the the remainder of the playoffs we keep your eye on on things maybe players along the way coach also\nBlame 'em this weekend as Israeli now for me I'm going to go and watch for college games over the weekend I'm going to go out to watch Lou and I saw you weigh on Saturday\nSunday I Want to drive across to watch our ... in 'em and then Indiana's gaming at Michigan State so I mean I'll Try and catch bits and pieces if I can but for me now the the focus like I said once these means that on someone who was to see what talents out there and we'll come we recruit from next year\nIt feels like coach and and having been here at the radio station for a couple of years and uh and seeing the development of the franchise that they're really does seem to be a buzz and excitement and then of course you've also got to talk of of MLS in St Louis again this is a it really does appear to be a great a great time to be a a soccer fan in St Louis\nYeah hundred percent on the I think that's a real good real good feel factor around the park around the club in general even though we we all she lost the game last weekend which is again which was disappointing but it seems like there's a real good buzz around it um with the way that we've got the full houses are selling out the ... for the last couple of games with with all the the last salute talk I think\nI'm like I said it's it's a positive place to be really happy to be a um an now hopefully we can build our mission will be back to the next year\nAnd you're in you're here in St Louis your family's here is data and and I know it took a little while to get that whole process is that that live up to all the expectations ...\nFamily O'Hare now wife and two children a style thankfully or not that's made a big difference to my life having them them here and with me and settled in the happy in their schools and like the area that we live in Soviet will be here for the majority of the off season will go back to England probably for a couple of weeks over Christmas but majority so I won't be spent enough\nCoach thanks so much for dropping by and uh we we love to have any and we love talking about the team and I appreciate you coming in again so close to the to the\nEnd of the season a couple of days ago and now time to look ahead thanks so much you know everything you did for us

out in ... city in Columbia covering the Missouri Tigers are good friend bill pollock Bill thanks as always for joining the show sir how are you\nDoing well look forward to seeing ranked team come in the in the Missouri and there'll be another conference match up for the tigers\nThere's any question about it in and do you know a a ranked opponent in the house a man and it's\nYou know it's sparked a lot of conversation about\nThe accomplishments of a very old him and Andrew lack in their tenure in that a ... and again that one missing piece so far at least maybe the ... the main one going into the weekend is that elusive win against the top twenty five team and and you were there on on Tuesday Afternoon bill when when one coach Jordan was asked about it and\nA few sort of dismiss it as a ... something that's not a huge deal but I got to imagine this you know it is pretty significant or even if it's Kentucky it's a big deal to potentially get away to the top twenty five oh\nAbsolutely and I know very the company line that I think most coaches because it's the next game we just want to win the next game but it has to be weighing on let me to\nA competitor so we know that from his playing days\nYou could tell just by the way he coaches emotions so they know about it they know what's at stake he knows his record his own seven against regimes and he got to feel that you know he's got to be looking over his shoulder in terms of job security to just exactly\nWhat's going to happen after the season so to to be able to have\nA victory like this at least to get one when an FCC play against are ranked opponents on your own field is certainly help bolster his case saying now that he's on the foot last year he was and he went out\nAnd everybody knew what he alluded to it as they made their bowl announcement that they were going to sleep Texas you know kind of joked about it I mean if he's been in that position to have a victory over ranked team it certainly does mean a lot in each just probably trying to take some pressure off the players\nKnow the team will come in with with that\nThere was a foreign three record on the year yet to win a game\nInside the Southeastern Conference but obviously that's South Carolina game there's always going to at least for now is going to stand out as as that as that\nBig sign of a missed opportunity for this football team but with this crazy as that game was I I I get this impression build that we do actually kind of comes into this game and sort of their situation right now as underrated and I think\nWhat would shows is that\nThe situation right now as underrated and I think\nWhat would shows is that is the fact that they introduced schemes don't touch a you know touchdowns favorites over a ranked opponent I I think they give you an idea of the talent on this team do you see that as well\nYeah I Do I mean it's it's their um you know when I watched the game that's where I really had a chance to kind of pay attention to this team was against Georgia side and it was a game that you know they ended up losing and and the score\nAnd make it seem as as close as what it was forty three twenty nine I mean you're still in touch downs but what I saw from Missouri was a team that had\nHigh FCC caliber speed amongst their number one they were just as fast just as strong as Georgia where it came into play was on their desk\nAnd I saw that on kick off coverage and kickoff returns where you have second maybe third stringer is\nA George ahead more speed they had more strength and and that was you know that was the difference but this team can play with a lot of change in the conference remember they had that manual hall on the field but he was basically a deep way they targeted them once or twice so lock was without his\nTop wide receiver for that George again\nIn there I mean they shot themselves in the foot so the potential to challenge is there now I think where you have to scrutinize very Odom\nIs can he get those guys to quit making those mistakes quit shooting themselves in the foot\nIt looking Vanderbilt played Florida really tough to do and they get Kentucky a run for their money too so Sandy is no pushover and then you still live Tennessee it you know in Arkansas as you look at the the rest of the schedule I\nI Will say this about this team they seem pretty motivated and I think it would take a lot to get them down and and keep them out of this show something\nCatastrophic yet made a complete meltdown what would really have to see this season where you're like OK this thing is really going to turn south I'm\nNot saying that that's necessarily going to determine the Windsor losses for the rest of the season but I still think there'll be competitive I think it'll be a spirited season by and and spirited next week even if they are even if they were to lose this game\nYou know I got to ask you before we roll out the maybe the biggest news on campus is we tend to be the new John Porter and it was a devastating blow to the basketball program they're less than two weeks away from a tipping off this season\nI mean it it did maybe it's a little too simplistic my job back there is this going to have on the immediate thought that this season Mormons do basketball\n[laughter] yeah I mean it's you know it's like what you know how can Missouri turn their luck around it's just you know I mean it's just it's almost it's unbelievable I mean it would have just to tell this story like all of you know this is going to happen and they're going to lose you know Michael Porter for most of the season and then\nKnow John ... will be hurt you know many marketing door you know green back I mean you look at like the big recruits even on the football side of guys that have come in and this kind of turned out to be a Boston and I think I'll take the bus but it's just like they can't\nGet that moment where it's like All right we've got top quality here it it's going to be a challenge because ... talked about John tape being\nBeing the X factor when a college basketball game that's\nUm rely so much on outside shooting ... who is going to try to attack inside and he had a guy and John ... who could do both the guy that could shoot from the outside and gets to the random you know he talked about there being a big part of this team and now that's gone so\nUm you know what the number of freshmen coming in um you know talent but they're gonna have to learn to play together so it'll be a really interesting to see how this came kind of molds together and employees well you know the I thought they did\nReally well last year without a without ... to cash in Jordan Barnett so I'll pick up a senior leadership now or that's a veteran leadership to show them it'll be interesting to see how the first the first month and a half the does\nNeal Pollack from the Missouri net and I know you you while you were going to your your weekly podcast and what what can we expect

Spartans and then patent Bill Maher cat\nScans down three six\nBest game in the area tonight with Steve Smith is done with Doug clients done you know the patent bill last time I mean an absolute boatload from last year\nAnd a comeback seven and two on the season and really just ... especially the second half of the year just having a tremendous year you know market decline what a great job he's done and turn around that market program so that is going to be the marquee game and then I Will talk about that in our last segment\nIn the next district is\nThe ... will host Ozark tonight a eureka should win that won pretty handily in that one a match up now the four or five Lafayette and Kirk would that is at the wood\nKirk would listen to break that two game losing streak but when they're eureka wins a lot of people who thought including myself that this would be your district final instead it's going to be your district semi final and that makes it even more interesting\nNext week down on the bottom part in all Springfield match up Joplin and kick approve will play an animal Lindbergh in northwest will go at it in the three six match up there at Lindbergh so really when you look at it at the top part of this bracket\nIn class sex that's where you're going to see the district champion come out of a you know unless barring anything silly taken place [noise]\nWalk bridge the number one seed in districts three they'll take on France's how central over in Columbia tonight\nBackyard rivalry game another tremendous game that we'll talk about for instance ... West Wing do these to match up it's an awfully big battle so that'll be a lot of fun to watch out in St Charles county Troy taking on blue springs south and then blue springs and Jeff city and the three six match up and then out west [laughter]\nReally looking at and what could take place there and I think you're going to see\nAt least some of north getting one seat but I really think that district where it's going to come out down below with the least so west to rock curse there on a collision course to play next week\nSo it'll be a lot of fun and classic now we go to class five water buys in the in the mix share a lot of playing games tonight Jackson the number one seed Poplar Bluff will play host Oakville whatever that game will travel to Jackson next friday and then next friday Fox and sacrament boy\nWe had a great game with them a couple of weeks ago but now you're going to see another great game was a lot more on the line than just regular season bragging rights down in Jefferson County\nI'm Down below them in the next district shot in park way south [laughter] we'll hook up and a four or five match up well parkway Weston Webster Groves and the three six will match up Melville the number one seed and his just strictly on any of the number two seed from Paul day okay with that um [noise]\nWith their schedule and everything you know I think they're just fine sitting in that number two slot because what that's going to Maine is if they hook up with Jackson or Fox\nThey most likely will host that game or the specially if it's Jackson if Jackson can be Fox in the top district ... because they will have to travel to Melville fiance would host that quarter final game\nAnd believe me you rather hosts that game then you would have to go down to the pet\nIn Jackson and play down there so I think Paul days okay with that two state [noise] ah down below Lebanon Glendale steel central Glendale plant some great football Carthage also an outside over on the other side [noise]\nLiberty one spill and Francis how north will match up and up playing a game winner will get zoom all North Korea north and is June wall\nE's south excuse me get a bye they will play next Saturday afternoon\nSo north a little bit of an easier road here timberland possible matchup and the corps stimulant once she'd do get the winter Smith caught and hit me to play tonight battling whole will play next week is well\nThis right side of this bracket is just absolutely brutal while north is going to have to duck a lot of land mines to get through and possibly have an all St Louis match up with who I think's gonna win on the opposite side I think beyond any in Jackson have a really really good shot over an outside\nClass for skip down to ... district to do all hosts Windsor tonight\nThat game is going to be played over\nIt looks like they're going to play the game at Webster Groves tonight double checked that for you and yes they are going to play [noise] they're going to match that came up over a must feel tonight and the grass\nUm you know we'll do without a home until next year so we'll do will play Windsor St Mary's and after that game is at St Mary's summit will host gateway Roosevelt\nWill take on bishop to\nIt will host gateway Roosevelt\nWill take on bishop the bird that game is going to be down at gateway\nInteresting district would do play in the best football other than a team called CBC\nIn the area I'm really just a tremendous look this year for the la du rams they should get going with this district but I tell you what I'll be interested to see them and Roosevelt match up in a district final that could be a lot of fun\nBorders are sitting in the district below them and they could end up playing or a brand and we see the candidates and Lakers union also sitting in the mix as well but Web city also lurking on that side of the brackets so for him to do to make it through\nYou have got a gauntlet that you're going to have to get through on that side ... number one seat on the other side and gets you city Clinton and Jennings match up tonight\nAnd I see the U.S and the court will play tomorrow I like am I CBS is draw a dig it you know they get the Winter Park way north river view ... button and the crew gets the W. tonight they match up with him I see the U.S next week I like it might CDS on this side of things in in that number two seed\nThen right below them zoom all these the number one seed takes on warrants in primary in St dumps will match up tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock and then Hannibal St Charles Westminster parkway central\nMatchup below their so some interesting scenarios there in class for now class three you look at the ... district ... number one\nThey're going to get the buy confluence has backed out of the playoffs not enough players so return will have the by week may move on Degas the winner of boroughs and Miller career\nSt Clair plays the Wii tonight and then
