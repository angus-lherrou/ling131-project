like playoff weather and the home team came through\nYeah it did it felt like a playoff atmosphere from the fans and a felt playoff like from the players are really good start to the to the game and you could see some nerves come in is is the game went on and we didn't put Tulsa way but\nWe came out with the will to shut up three points where we need to be and now we're one point away from that magic number of fifty three\nTo also had some opportunities throughout the course of the game and then there were other moments other structures throughout that match Delaware is like they they couldn't even near uh the other side of of the field and and and had absolutely zero opportunities St Louis dictating to temple but\nThey they they let Tulsa kind of hang around whether that's that's certainly not by design they were never able to get that goal to put them away but also at the same time kind of kept them at arm's length\nAnd insert a baby to sort of the goalkeeper from Tulsa I thought was very very good maybe three or four outstanding sees particularly in the first half\nTo keep the game where it was and then you could feel Tulsa to get a little bit of confidence they had a little bit of belief going into a into the second half the lead her into the second half\nAnd I saw the insertion of I've been ... one of our former players um help them and I thought I thought I'd to

on the big five fifty Katie arrest Jeremy thanks as always for the time sir how are you\nI'm doing well appreciate a guy\nJeremy of a big night last night or a lot of excitement surrounding this team what has this been like you know for you I'm\nAs the vice president and general manager in during this stretch where it is certainly the playoffs I I'm sure for you guys it's it's finally been that the tangible goal leading up by you know you guys can\nProbably tasted here ah the weeks leading up to this\nI think um you know we've been on a good run here and we've had the thing I'm with a few or something that maybe we should have at all if we felt that birth but everybody in the right now you know trying to get in the playoffs or in the playoffs\nHas ever as well\nRight now you know trying to get in the playoffs or in the playoffs I had a birthday as well so why do different anybody else but we haven't had a good round the guys\nAre playing well a little but you know it's kind of business as usual you know around the park guys are just doing what they do and coaching staff is there on what they do all year and it's just a following through and you know just making sure that we're staying true to the process but a clinic hiding and you know good energy levels around the park from everybody\nSpeaking of energy level of energy levels Jeremy started again much was sharply guys got after it and make a big time say really did start in a game that was the beginning\nI thought we started out of the gate on the front foot and that'll be important on Saturday Night because he was well against Oklahoma City\nYou know get the crowd into the game it gets out of the away team on their heels a little bit and\nIt was hard to put on their heels because they had nothing to lose so they were playing a little Red Cross the little wide open and unfortunately we weren't able to take advantage of that a from a goal standpoint a sign a couple of others to put in\nBut we were able to manage thinking because of the way they played and it caused a few dicey moments in a few situations we have to deal with\n'em but you know the guys put a good hard work but Mike effort and got it down and started preparing for Saturday\nParticularly in the beginning I Would say the first one you think twenty twenty five minutes we created probably street or or during the Jim sort of not really been sharp um we could have been up for a couple of goals early in the game\nFor sure I mean I think you know Corey uh two really good looks ... at the post on another really late in the first half felt you know and one or two of those go away and it's a completely different games um but they didn't and we have to you know trying to sharpen up\nOpportunities before Saturday at the time of year it's about you know making your opportunity there moments count\nAnd hopefully we can do that but yeah energy levels were high we're on the front but exciting a really good first twenty twenty five minutes effect you know does that mean the rest of the game of\nPoor um it was just you know those those pretty pretty exciting narrowly on and like you said they all sort of made a few really good to say that I've had a little bit\nUm had a feeling that was going to be you know just to go or to what's going to go and\nHe he you know even though the second half\nUm you know we didn't necessarily control attempt moments that were there were fine and certainly had some possession did allow us to to be tested them defending side a couple of times I thought there were some boxes vending machines by the sinner back so we're there we're quite good to to keep tools\nYet but I thought Sean in families you know we're we're both very good at at the Sundance and especially when you have to deal with some services are going to\nTurn that website has such a wicked you know serve that he can put it in different ways you can float or they can away but he can drive it and I concur with um I I agree I think back to ... I mean I Would I'd call them up for that as well with that when you and all that we're going into the second half always difficult to deal with\nBut I thought I thought we were pretty good they're effectively and for a moment Tony tracking back\nGetting himself into some good spot there too because you know pulse I was trying to combine a little bit but they're also want to take up the drip also a difficult day of defending for there to send our marriage but I thought that they added to it and get a good job as well\nWhat did you think of the ... and and do what together you know the work was always um you know just put in a huge effort Corey scores the winter what what'd you think of them was at the end\nIt worked well together and um you know in the past and I think because of work right open up some things were Corey Corey with you know I was able to come under again\nAnd received a few balls and get faced up and turned them for you know a bond that you know a couple that we almost slipped into ... as well but um I thought was willingness to running behind that Iraq\nOpened up the game for Cory a little bit and and that was important so a different type of partnership than maybe some other guys when they pair up but I thought they complimented each other you know very well and you got to pull out of work in my back\nTo back it was an outside back how do you think she did the same time Tony defending would lose some of the park do you think he did with the\nFire and I mean there are those guys have been through enough games in a battle\nUm that they can easily adapt and flip back and so I thought fan was good with his distribution\nTemple claim never got stuck on the ball on us for\n'em and and he was good that way and he had a tough matchup defensively or you know some some pain from\nTurkey and have coming out and then you know for the most part he was able to you know push him to the end line are pushing to help buy defensively and I hate that well I'm telling you gave us a call now from a ball like you said it was a different type of field a different type of game\nOr we weren't on the ball maybe as much as we have there and I'm here recently when we were there was no you know give away some mistakes\nAnd we didn't get caught in between two thoughts somebody we just played clean and simple and a Tony adapt to being back in the little ah quite well help us in the air and the went a little bit in the second half as well\nAnd it was good to see those guys will step up and take advantage of the opportunity\nTo Germany did you feel like the long break in between um a couple of weeks ago and last night and and then obviously on Saturday did you guys well for this final stretch use of a two games in four days\nAnd I think we were able to you know refreshed and recharge a little bit how we treat that we went and trained or in college or get some really nice grass fields over there and just changed the environmental a little bit um you know a good\nThing like that because one day we turn out their lives Wendy like the state of Kansas and that's how it was flat park so maybe we were prepared for it but it was just good this depression often\nYou know the guys you know a day off to let them recharge here and there you know you said a routine is the same process is the same but you know all the time off running I think has really allowed us for these last two games hard on you know and and understanding of what's in front of us\nWe we speak of the season in what they're bringing the town and what their games and it looked like what's your what's your handicap on the scene Antonio match up with our ... and ... with the galaxy it's a it's an interesting weekend\nIs trying to explain it you know a different people today kind of what all the scenario that everything you know I think the bottom line is we hold it in our hands you can take care of but not\nHow people they were on there is I don't I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but I research were very dangerous and probably three to four or five really really good moments on the corner kicks for ...\nYeah it's an art than the ... I'm Sorry for the class and save water um corners\nFree ... different level or not because to any level to cope with the games that you'll watch\nThat get this ... page eyes scary I'm ready to stop the study or something like that yeah the ... which are credible [noise] um I think it's something that will work out a lot\nAbout how they're going to shop from Columbus was very careful how come we work simply saying that we think might be able to cope with all those boats without ...\nYou have to have good delivering the opt out people that were there to like ... or ... at the end of it because you come up with the best Burger King\nOf the best idea that well but if you have little people that\nCan live with a ... at the end of the charts at ... ... or ... or the darn thing here\nSo tiny holes people who are aggressive and I want to go to things so I was sitting next to actually make that much\nConfidence plays a lot in that as well I mean you just feel good about the moments in and like you said they're willing to get after balls that are that are either in the air or falling to the ground [noise]\nYeah it's it's a mentality thing for me I mean I've been having a strong willed so\nI Want to get away from your marketing a U.S like you had on something or even if it's ... it was the ... it was it was the star wars the first one sided with the Sacramento career she sticks and what are they in the in a log in and around the ha opposites about ... ...\nYou know in in the in the during the week you and I spoke briefly about about the team in training and\nAnd uh you you had some thoughts to maybe there were some nerves or at least see where the guys who are a little bit different in in training um how did you feel that they came out uh you know it was a good start to the game but did you feeling locker room and they had their wits about them or did you feel like there were a little piece of the nurse\n... almost to the owners of the house that is the foliage harm to catch up with the way it was higher than average back there said the number of all the guys that I'm sort of again\nThere was any with free policy can all your every time you know I think I mean I'll be honest with you on the train carrying them so we have a lot of struggles I as a result of speech San Antonio\nWon the ... and it fell a little bit out of some of them are great in Albany hoping ... points and stuff out what it was a little bit but\nUm I get from food that an eBay when it's among baseball but I mean like when when the game like ... how about John ultimately they're all going to be a little bit some of those are the strikes are cheaper\nFast because the players are so hungry to start with the cat in the playoffs and that said that desperate that so it's a good thing because I Want to start lodge but what you want it\nIt can spread all over the counter productive but I thought last article the child is chef's\nJacket off we could have been a lot of areas we we did what we have to be a shower Israel which is which are important um three points or another for an hour a look at ready for the next one against okay say you know\nYou we whenever we talk about the game we can talk about performance in and just find a good performance by ball movement or how the game looked\nBut I found the defending signed last night there were a couple of moments where we had to defend in the Eighteen because they had planned a combination and there was a potential moment on the ground around the corner and and provided some sermons that could have been dangerous my thought in the center of the back\nSo we did okay from a defending side from ...\nYeah I mean every ... days I Do like there are two questions on the Gulf so called ... I'm good players in and around the final so they can cause problems if she says I download\nCheese but they they got some patients will we knew it was ... when you go and it was a little bit off the over ... I'm not a big corporate sure they will take your ... like the couple of moments of what's called a ... shape for the most part but we defined decided well I'm not altogether style is all about\nWhat you had to move some guys around because of because of injury I'm sort of give us your perspective on maybe ... Vita and Tony walls or to start off with in terms of how they stepped in and and their performance\nThe out so they they do is find a job I mean it's a totally obviously plays in that room are strong little scratches natural position obviously has been planted a ride back into doing well for us but we will be an injured it was um\nIt was an easy to which is why Johnny backing out and I was ... found that comes back in the rye where he's probably the number that process follow the show I'm fortunate we have to apply for the ready to step in to those faults and it was ... completely out possession and so it was good I like having a\nSquare peg in a square hole so to speak on the other fellow that was the post office\nAnd ... continues with the high were great and the difficult guy or forcing her back to deal with them is like\nYeah I mean again with his with his priced out of your energy and enthusiasm for them to show that I Would I Would imagine you sign up box I playing against David especially the ones that maybe you could argue like a little bit change that lease space in bon ... is very very good\nA little bit it\nSeems at least I said it was very very good at exploiting

the end of the you know the first\nJourney and you know ... as we look back you know you know some five months in does or does it does it feel like it's been or you know five or six months you know going back all the way back to march does it does it seem that long does it seem longer or does it seem shorter uh it kind of give us your since there are on that perspective\nIt's funny I have

teams across the Southeastern Conference\nI think so you had three or four they had to have a huge winds Mississippi State and South Carolina really backwards was against the wall already having to conference losses if those guys who started a oh and three in the league especially with high expectations you you don't know what would happen there the wheels really could have come off\nMe wherever I Am a at least the rails a little bit the momentum of Kentucky and keeps him in the in the picture for Florida a huge win win against LSU it sets up some scenarios that we'll talk about a little while uh in the in the ACC east\nThat could be real significant for Florida about him and able to pull out they went over LSU\nAnd then we have some other teams still trying to find themselves an average one of those things\nYou have all been absolutely ... has been inconsistent missed on some really big plays that would have probably one of the show the Michigan State game so you don't watch what's happening there uh Missouri a you know had that game in South Carolina lose it down the stretch just got to be very disappointing game\nFrom Missouri and even in South Carolina mission we stay having one of those games all that really does you just kind of keeping treading water so you just gotta see still a whole lot that they play the the two through five in the south or an ACC west it's still up for grabs in in a corner what happens in a\nIn the other she Georgia game or you know really the the upper bracket for uh for the ACC system in question\nWe're still a few weeks away from the first college football playoff hole but we're starting to ... some teams up is one of those teams Texas\nI think so I think there are dressed in a column and Wendy's Web site this week talking about the college football playoff in a large number of teams that are still in play a number of things with just one last in Texas being one of those\nUm you know I think that you've got a situation where a whole lot of teams are are kind of much together maybe not maybe not a separate himself from other teams or Texas or any one of those at the state of Texas\nActually kind of maybe a little bit of a rebound TCU a good defense team Baylor is a is showing inspect ability Texas a and M. certainly now Texas with the window for Oklahoma you don't really know if that says so much about Texas being back or or maybe Oklahoma having some difficulties because of the game dad at home with the army a few weeks ago\nWe keep bringing up Notre Dame some say they just play their game left on their schedule you agree with that\nProbably the southern Cal at the end of the season of a plan I think that played it on the road is always a tough game but [laughter] but Notre Dame you know there are the Michigan up up front they they win Michigan or they beat Stanford or they go on the road and be Virginia Tech and beat him handily and Notre Dame is elephant in the room when you look at the playoffs because\nTheir their own guy you know there's everybody else and then there's Notre Dame and if Notre Dame winds all their ballgames they're going to be in the college football playoff\nAnd if that means or two or three conferences don't get their champion and is unfair is that is that's what it would be so I think the the teams that are that have hope of being in the college football playoff we really need to start pulling against Notre Dame because every time that Notre Dame win the game that pushing closer and closer to having one of those four B it's\nOn the prep for sports reporter here
