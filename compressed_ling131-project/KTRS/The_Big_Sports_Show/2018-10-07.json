episode of elder talk this is Joe Cordell has promised this week we have a gas talking about a topic that we covered before with this very guest and it was very popular lots of people wanted to know more so we decided to ask a bill mass to come\nLots of people wanted to know more so we decided to ask bill ... asked to come back and talk again about reverse mortgages\nThis is an issue that has become increasingly important in part in the long term care context how do we pay for it but also just to meet general financial needs that people have during that last thirty or so of their lives Susan let's do an introduction to get a bill\nMath alright ... is the vice president at grocery mortgage and as a reverse mortgage specialized Christian marketed originated over thirty billion dollars in home loans including reverse mortgages and has been named one of the nation's top commercial services by mortgage servicing News International markets news\nThere is one of only two certified reverse mortgage professionals living in the state of Missouri and the other one he knows pretty well it's his wife Lisa\n[laughter] now that's interesting bill you're one of only two certified reverse mortgage professionals that's correct that's oh so this is the only designation I assume that truly available to spite was focusing on reverse mortgages\nRight a certified reverse mortgage professional or cramp as we refer to it see our MP um is it is is awarded to somebody who has shown a diligence in terms of pursuing ethical standards but also in terms of the number of loans that have been or a originated are generated him out of ... definitely so we only two of us living in the state of Missouri\nThat's great so um what we're honored to have you back a lots of people had good things to say from your last two parents\nSo we're going to cover some of the same things we covered before but even those who are listening to her that show it's been what a year or so ago I Will benefit from from a renewal of that conversation as well as the course that the new things that we can talk about\nSo let's start the fundamentals what is a reverse mortgage\nA reverse mortgage is the means of pulling equity out of one's home [noise] so the difference between what you owe on your home and what the homes appraised value in the current real estate market is is your equity and depending on your age you're allowed to borrow a certain percentage of that equity\nThe younger you the older you are the more equity you can borrow the younger you are the less equity you borrow and that of course is because we base our lending an actuary figures figuring that the the longer you live or the more you know the more you're going to be using so we provide less\nAnd the more risk to the lender a crime you are less money and it's a ... year repayment is further out into the future correct so this this is a strange investment or so that people understand the complexity and the rules and the regulation I think they need to appreciate the point that you just might and that's a similarity to\nNo no not at all I mean we have to be pretty blatant wouldn't you wouldn't have the blade and yes\nAnd the contract will spell out what would constitute these circumstances\nYes and no no that sort of vaguely to catch these maintenance because it can be anything for a broken windows to\nA hard to list the to recall the possibilities are okay so so there's some good faith involved in interrupting a contract I can I can tell those as a lawyer that that there that the court would impose a a good faith or interpretation so people than\nWhen they're thinking about how much money they might be able to generate with is a I was also surprised to learn that there are several reduction in the amount that you might otherwise qualify for when you and our first talking about this bill we were talking about for example if you had a house it's worth\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you have a loan of a hundred or I Would say oh so then there was available a hundred and fifty thousand dollars that can be far for the reverse mortgage and you said no no no there's a number of productions and and calculations that will limit that I'm Out so give our listeners a feel for what that might be okay\nBasically there that the the reduction or the the amount of assets there are there are a lot of equity that can be borrowed is tied to one's age if you're sixty two years of age you can probably borrow somewhere around forty three percent of the value of the home and if you're eighty five and above you can probably borrow somewhere next near Seventy five percent of the value\nWhen you say value mean the value of the equity\nValue the value of the home so ... forty five forty three percent of the value of the home or if you're eighty five Seventy five percent of the value of the home unless the reason why you're only allowed to borrow it percentage\nIs the basics we haven't really talked about this but the basics of a reverse mortgage\nAre the money that you borrow you are not obligated to make a payment on that money this is money you're equity or barrio we shouldn't leave that for now should rent right you don't kind of an important lesson number one selling point you don't make a payment this is this is tax free or is that considered income so it's tax free\nBut this money that you're borrowing is going to be charged interest and mortgage insurance and that balance is going to rise overtime\nSo again the reason why a sixty two year old is going to be allowed to borrow less is because they're alone will be collecting interest in mortgage insurance over a longer period of time\nAnd the HUD and the government does not want to have the asset be less than what his old I'm Alone at the end of the day so again if you're eighty five you can borrow more because they figure you're not going to live as long and so therefore will lend you more because the interest in mortgage insurance that accumulates on alone won't be is is high\nSo just for clarification purposes um\nWhen ... when you said that interest will accumulate during the course of this\nWhen ... when you said that interest will accumulate during the course of this period um\nSome people might have thought you meant that that you only have to pay you interest so let me like this clear what what when you do reverse mortgage no payment is made no payment is made on the mortgage even though the interests of cumulus as you're describing just so people are clear\nAh you do have to pay the taxes on your house you have to pay the upkeep on your house 'cause that's the collateral for loans right correct I'm so let me ask you this if you have a a house for example you do have a first mortgage on it is that an obstacle to getting a reverse mortgage\nWill it can be it can also be a positive they're from the standpoint is if there's enough equity if the if the first mortgage doesn't exceed\nA forty five percent of the value of the home you could pay that existing mortgage off and turn it into a reverse mortgage now the hundred thousand dollar mortgage that you want to add the ... that you were making payments on it comes to reverse mortgage and you don't make payments on that hundred thousand dollars\nNow is that what people do so here's the question it's assumed that a listener has a house that has a first started of fifty thousand dollars in the house is worth a hundred and sixty or\nWould they would they go ahead and make application for a reverse mortgage based on the whole value and knowing that they're going to have to take a portion of that and pay off the first mortgage or would they piled this on or politicians not the right word would this would this go on top of the existing mortgage that would continue to be in effect\nYou know that's a good question Joe and there can be no other leans against the property other than the reverse mortgage for the first mortgage would have to be even if they had a first mortgage in a second mortgage both those mortgages would have to be retired and be replaced with a reverse mortgage so\nAgain yes people do use the reverse mortgage to pay off existing mortgages and of course the product becomes more enticing were more valuable as an asset if there is no mortgage or if there's a small mortgage against the house currently because again there is no mortgage obviously you can borrow more if there if there is a mortgage and you've got to pay that off and then what you get is reduced\nSo give us an example where I'm somebody has a value maybe you want to use your own numbers\nIn which um they have a house of a certain value and I know listeners are curious how much could potentially get out of my house after these various adjust much that you've mentioned it may be so of what you haven't mentioned yet\n[noise] okay so let's take a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home\nA two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home and you've got a couple of it's a sixty five years of age or the husbands Seventy and the wife is sixty five legal with the wife's age because she has the younger of the two so the the the qualifiers are based on the younger the two\nAnd we take the wife's age and we say that two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home they can borrow somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars\nIn with a hundred thousand dollars um they're free to do with it at what they what they like\nUm uh they can't take a hundred thousand dollars all in one lump sum they must take it in increments you're only allowed to borrow sixty percent of the entire eligibility number at the beginning\nAnd the reason they've done that as the as F ha and hard and found in the past that people who have taken everything they're eligible for immediately tend to spend it faster and tend to go right through it much faster than those who are a little bit more judicious with their money because they're not getting it all at one time\nI don't really understood this correctly so an example you gave housework two hundred fifty thousand dollars\nThey're eligible given those ages to get a hundred thousand dollars but that hundred thousand dollars they can only get sixty thousand dollars immediately the first year correct and in the ... year yes yes okay and after the first year they can get immediately the other ...\nThe other forty percent becomes available yes yes are there any restrictions on what you can do with the money no none of the you could pay off alone you could go on a trip UK refrigerator you can use it to help groceries audio has used it just it just to ease the monthly burden that they're under right now at farmers with pharmaceutical drugs\nAre with groceries with with other expenses that they use it as a supplement but yes we do see people using it for vacations it just depends on your circumstances it at the time and and and what you would need the extra boost for\nIs the interest rate that is charged higher or lower or about the same as a corresponding inner strike for a traditional more\nAbout the same it's about the same uh um there are two different types of a reverse mortgages one that includes an adjustable rate and one that includes a fixed rate is now let me explain the differences with a fixed rate the interest rates are somewhere in slightly higher than where what's currently going out with the Kurds thirty year fixed rate\nBut with a fixed rate with a reverse mortgage you're limited to what's called the lump sum disbursement where you must take one pay out at one time and that's sixty percent of what you're eligible for you take it you walk away with a fixed rate and there's your money you're leading forty percent of your ... you're eligible equity on the table you're you're walking away from and saying I don't want to touch it\nI'm taking the lump sum and more never going to take the other forty percent you're not allowed to take a fixed rate product\nIf you take an adjustable rate product then you're allowed again like I mentioned before to take sixty percent of the eligibility and the remaining forty percent a year later\nMost people when they take an adjustable rate or looking at it from the standpoint that they want to take money over a long period of time and they don't want to take sixty percent right away they want to take out a five hundred dollars a month or a thousand dollars a month and they and they take it out as they need it or they take a payments they can take a payment say I want five hundred dollars a month to come to me for sixteen months\nSo for people who are are are taking do to these numbers um\nThe two hundred and fifty thousand dollar example would mean that if you insisted on a fixed right that you would only get sixty thousand bucks out of a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house correct\nA but for those who are willing to go with an adjustable rate than they can that will will move about overtime or what for example now would be the adjustable rate\nThe current adjustable rate on a a one year adjustable reverse mortgage is four point three percent\nOr is there a ceiling on how hot it right great question is if there's a five percent cap\nThat that's a five percent cap over the start rate so in a worst case scenario that four point three could turn into nine points three however there's a adjuster is built in to that cap which say you can't take any ... you can increase alone the lender can increase the interest rate by any more than two percent in a given year\nSo for it to fully is extend out to nine point three it would take three years of adjustments to get their their weight can go no lower than what's called the margin so every adjustable rate has a fix portion to it and the ... portion is called the margin\nSo for instance of a rate if an interest rate is four points three and the margin is one point five we take for points three and subtract one point five and we say that the live or index that was being used is at two point eight\nWe had two point eight to the margin and that gives us the interest rate in this adjusts once a year\nThere is a monthly adjustable interest rate their interest rate is let's say four percent it's lower but it is it ten percent cap and most people right out of the box just choose not to\nGet involved with the interest rate as a ten percent cap the benefits aren't don't outweigh the the the deficit\nTo sell your home and then according up to the lender the lender has the ... the the right to extend in in in a hundred and eighty day increments if they want you they don't have to but typically if you can show good faith that you're trying to actively market the home and usually as by saying I've got a contract with a real estate agent\nThey'll extend beyond the six months but the letter of the last six months and then a hundred and eighty increments following that\nSo I can see where people who are thinking that their primary objective is to age in place they want to stay on their home as long as they can and that describes a recent survey done by our indicated that like Ninety percent or so of people who are older than sixty five at subjective [noise]\nSo whenever they turn to a products such as a reverse mortgage to help them achieve that end it's good to know that there is an a back door if it turns out that that plan doesn't work out and that's a critical component we made brief referenced it while ago but [noise]\nBut I like this product in that scenario because it does allow for the fact that there's unknowns in a person might take out this this loan do the improvements on their house have the full intention of staying there for the next Thirty years and three days later after all these things are completed they have a stroke\nSo suddenly they're going into long term care now it's important for people who are who are developing a plan to realize that when a catastrophic event occurs like that as a tourist ... does when as we get older\nThen we want to know that that there's there's a a an alternative course that's not punitive and in this case there is meaning the house can be sold the interest as accumulated which at that point can be very little\nCan be paid off and there's no penalty associated with that early pay off which we discuss the get before the break\nCorrect and one of the things we haven't talked about you mentioned interest I'm On a typical or regular traditional home loan where you're making a payment or you can deduct the interest on your taxes\nWith a reverse mortgage you can't do that because you're not paying interest but at the end of the ... at the end of the day when you finally pay the reverse mortgage off and you're paying all at a crude interest off then there is a large interest induction that's available to the homeowner of the homeowners have died it gets passed on to the air's\nI'm curious roughly what percentage of the clients you've had over the years ended up having their home paid off through the state or after they've passed versus being paid off while they're alive\nYou know I guess the while you're up there alive scenario would be either that they've moving to in a voluntarily or they've had to move into some sort of juice don't care I'm I'm curious what percent end up\nNot paying it off while they're alive at all and they pass and then it's paid off through the state I said I'm not following the property as\nWell in other words whenever you take out a reverse mortgage you technically don't have to pay it off until you either move or you die right um die in the house so to speak [laughter] I'm curious what percent die in the house so to speak\nOkay um I you know it's probably somewhere around fifty percent\nIs is is probably what we see now it depends on the situation to um uh if it's a it's a it's a couple a oftentimes I'm a ... the remaining spouse will try to stay in the home\nUm but it's not always practical ... especially if one if there's if some of the income is lost through Social Security one less Social Security check coming in um it's it becomes difficult for them to stay in the house I'd say somewhere I'm fifty percent\n[noise] but uh that's an important point to rise is if you have a husband and wife they would want to be sure and take out that loan jointly\nBecause otherwise us so if one spouse died and and the other is otherwise in the home and would prefer to stay there they presumably wouldn't have the right to do that if they were not\nAs if they hadn't taken out this loan and place in the house with security is that true correct correct so you'd want a husband and wife to both signed on it yes that way when one passes it's really lasted ... right effect directly to lasted a rule\nLast went out now there is a provision where I'm a someone can uh be what's called a non borrowing spouse of a married couple and it did the scenario that were that is a true or that holds true as you have someone who was under the age of sixty two so you've got a husband let's say Seventy and his wife is sixty\nTo do or HUD and shirt or a federally insured reverse mortgage we have to base the criteria are the the requirements of how much equity they're going to be able to obtain based on the younger the too so we to take it off the sixty year old [noise]\nBut the rule is the sixty year old who came into the reverse mortgage under age cannot utilize the benefits of the reverse mortgage if the if the if the borrowing spouse passes away so let's say they have a hundred thousand dollar line of credit they're using it that the husband passes away\nAnd now who's remaining as a non borrowing spouse the really used to be the ... spouse had to pay the loan back and get out of the house that was the er pay the pay the loan back and then and then be on their way now they can stay in the home but they can't touch any of the assets so they have sixty thousand dollars remaining on that line of credit\nBut they weren't sixty two when they entered into the agreement they can't draw on the benefits they can stay in the house but they can't draw the benefits it doesn't matter if they've aged up\nIf they can stay in the house but they can't draw the benefits it doesn't matter if they've aged up no no you'd have to you have to ... at the moment they signed the ad in a moment they sign the agreement correct by so our listeners understand\nThis uh you can't be a co borrow or in that example you gave because you're not sixty two right right and you have to be sixty two to be able to have the hut insured product which is what most most lenders are going to provide a what most borrowers would want a present\nSo why would they not in the scenario you describe within weeks or even days of the person passing just go ahead and pull the rest of the money out well\nThat that can happen that can happen but oftentimes there's not enough ah an advance wanting to know that but if someone falls\nSignificantly ill that person has that person to make them make there has to make the request themselves so the person who's fallen ill if they can't make the request for that to get that\nRemaining funds that they don't get the remaining funds but there'll be a durable power of attorney and twice presumably ride that that no it it unless the power of attorney was invoked at the time they took out the reverse mortgage\nThen the the durable power of attorney could could make a request for the funds but it really yeah it ...\nPoint that is that with the very tricky because that's that's contrary to what the law would know normally assume but if you had a provision at a contract that for about it\nBut it would still have to be consistent with the statute in Missouri so I'm curious about that but anyway so people are on the alert that potentially a durable power of attorney\nEven if given to the spouse who was not a co borrow or because the spouse was under a sixty two that may not empower that spouse or a third party to invoke this access to the ... right right exactly exactly yeah it's a complicated discussion sometimes\nIt can be it can be but\nBut on its face so I get it it's a it's a means by which you can\nSafely plan to stay in your home give yourself money to accomplish that not have to make any payments and if things go as planned you'll die that home\nAnd in the house will be sold through the state or whatever they're after 'em but yet in the event that things go sideways and you have a stroke or you have a fall or something requires institutionalization beyond one year you're allowed to be out of the house for one year during the course of rehab or whatnot\nThen you can sell the house pay off existing debt at that point\nThen whatever's left of course belongs to that person's right they can keep the profit from the sale of home ... lots of things to think about so tell me what else what are the other common scenarios that you see among among people who are drawn to this product\nYou know we see 'em a occasionally is becoming more and more popular as gifting where are the grandparents will draw money out in order to gift\nTheir children or their grandchildren in one of the reasons is the the light to experience the joy of watching their grandchildren are children enjoy the money while they're alive instead of getting the money which they may get eventually after they've died [noise]\nThe grandparents can be quit the money or give the money away while they're alive and get to see their grandchildren by their first car of help pay for that that tuition [noise] um ... we ... so we see the gifting coming into play quite a bit [noise]\nI can see used for that yeah\nThe other thing is interesting Joe and Susan is a reverse mortgages can be used to purchase homes is becoming more and more popular\nA as a means to purchase homes for seniors especially those who are coming out of a situation where they're selling their existing home or let's say they've sold their existing home it was free and clear for three hundred thousand dollars and they want to downsize now to a two hundred thousand dollar home\nInstead of taking two hundred thousand dollars of the other three hundred thousand dollars in plug you get down to a new home they can put down sixty percent of the value of the new home so they put down a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on the new two hundred thousand dollar home\nAnd the remaining eighty thousand becomes their reverse mortgage and now they're going to be charged interest in mortgage insurance on that eighty thousand dollars but they're not making a monthly mortgage payment all they're doing is paying property taxes and homeowners insurance is becoming more and more popular\nOutrage explain that again or just because I Want I Want our listeners to understand this process it sounds like a very clever idea\nOwn you know animals were actually aren't making as well do\nYou go to Katie arrest dot com and join the conversation seems to be our sort of crazy I'll go\nBig five fifty K.

R. S. were cell phones or one triple eight five fifty K. E. T. R. S. A. R. E. T. or let's just get into the meat let's do it ... it up first well why don't we talk when we just get right into health care today I Know the folks have been shopping at the bit you've been getting lots of emails\nUm you've got several thousand folks that you actually have to respond to their our clients in terms of the changes to Medicare so when we open up with are smart choices about your health care segment that sponsored this week and every week for a very favorite folks\nCoventry health care of Missouri then at the company well you know what your request for college has just the callers have come through thank you as soon as we have Jay on line one to kick it off he has a question about Social Security\nI'm thirty five I have a question a friend of mine and I have a\nDebate going a little bit but but it's also been a more of it for me because I'm I think I might not find showed on the requirement\nSituation and a couple of months but anyway my friend is saying that he thinks the obviously and I know it is available you grow it at eight percent a year every year you're way past Jeff\nAnd I'm not ready then and I don't know about his income SARS but but ... says he's not gonna take it I Know I've got to have a solid\nPension and I think I might have gone ahead and then a month or so and um and quote editor for the start of Social Security all have\n'em up ... percent increase in out here so far um so I question on which philosophy like butter or do you think should I be starting the Social Security\nYou think should I be starting the Social Security\nAnd other animals were about to talk about health care I'm allowed to vote for tribes here I did twenty four hours\nIn the military so I don't have to do anything on that front with Medicare I Believe just want to really confirm that and what about five I could by that time and that to my pension plan\nI don't get me to a lot of different things that the best way to to evaluate by which by the way we are now because of\nSimon interest or are pretty have built up a pretty significant amounts of money to to provide a service dogs in my three or whatever questions like\nGreat takes shape well I think I Will I'll pick it up and starting with the Medicare question because that's an easy answer which is please do not do anything do not add a Medicare Advantage plan or a supplement to your try care because what happens is it will turn your ... off\nLuckily you have full veterans' benefits through the VA with your try care so you do not have to add any other policies and most specifically do not add a Medicare Advantage plan because what that does is it replaces you're try care so you don't want to do that\n[noise] ... that's probably smart idea [noise] um the other question that I guess he had a couple of other questions one was about about about taking Social Security now we're waiting until somebody I think that's I think it's kind of interesting the problem is we have with the answering the question are\nWe really don't have a lot of information we all know if he's married or single um if he was single I Would certainly say probably makes sense to take because you're not really trying to build that up later for someone else as a survivor benefits\nBecause the idea behind waiting is one to build the survivor benefit but also there did amortization of your Social Security benefits and basically what the government has done is that if you take it early you're ... you're ... you're you're you're increasing the length of the payments\nThat Social Security is going to be making too so they give you less annually you wait you're going to be taking it over a shorter period of time so they give you more there was a Seventeen year break even on that so you know it's really becomes a very personal decision as to if you're taking it earlier waiting\nYou know it was kind of interesting also in that um\nShe could have taken two years ago when he hit normal retirement age my question would be um or their deaths out there that should be dealt with um is a way to you know maybe a mortgage to ... to get rid of that\nIs not um why when you take the benefits right away especially if you have a pension way absolutely yeah don't really have enough information on the\nLine in terms of the ... back in the benefit I Would have to say that it's a difficult question to answer only because we're not sure about what you talked to other your blue early which is\nWhat you're volt I mean how much liquid cash or do you have available to you know in retirement assets for liquidity purposes of all your money tied up in\nEither CSP plans or four oh one K. plans et cetera having that having a lot of liquid cache of ill will to you liquid assets even if they are I'm already don't return on investment\nIs really a pretty good thing so I don't know if it makes sense for him to walk more money off\nUm to begin to increase his pension benefit especially if you need it\nSo that makes sense to me it sounds like she might be a candidate to speak with an advisor because he has a lot of questions with the span of variety of topics it's a perfect time to sit down with someone and kind of lay out what your plan is in retirement\nI think it would be real important gene or would certainly recommend the same thing if you're working with your lives where things started to really kind of lay out the algebra here\nYou how much you would you receiving it work periods of time how this fix it how does this fit into your game plan\nYou know we love to do that or office on our big electronics exporting for white Gordon um we like to say we like to play this is your wife right that's right and there's a lot of fun because we can lay out the various options that are there for you know frankly it sounds like you're in a situation where you have a lot of good decisions to make\nUm obviously those were the ones you make today are going to be in the moment based on your situation but making sure we will work for\nThem I think that's really where it is so I'm well thank you for calling this morning groups chicken is offered\nYes we do thank you Jay and now we also have kept the on line to see that Social Security question from her acts to morning Cathy\nMoore under four you're still talking to your ex cashiers is about you\nKnow I'm not talking about personal why should\nI Am thinking about that I'm thinking about retirement next year because of the retirement age of sixty six I was married to him I'm over ten years [noise]\nAnd I wanted to see if I could last on his cell phone is curious that um mine which would be I Would uh [noise]\nI guess I Would be able to collect path I can set up mine but my understanding of the security lately what they told me was gifts half of his as last son my full amount that I Would take off a mind set and I couldn't go with his\nShow Cathy I Believe were you born before January first Nineteen fifty four\nYeah that would bar in February Nineteen fifty three okay\nThat's what that's what I thought the math was so you are still eligible to discuss this with Social Security when you reach your full retirement age or also called normal retirement age you you can collect fifty percent of your ex husband benefit\nAnd then allow your benefit to continue to grow until you reach Seventy or until your full retirement benefits is more than fifty percent of your accent benefit you still have access to this because the rules change for every one that was born after January first Nineteen fifty four\nAre available to you all the way from\nThe more traditional ones that you see over by the ear to the ones that go all the way into your ear canal that no one knows that you were wearing so you have a lot of choices and you have that benefit available to annually so that means if you picked a pair and he didn't love 'em you could get a brand new pair of the very next year even if they're still under warranty you still have access to that effect\nYou know it's interesting because a Coventry really seems to be the one for a truly stepped over over the last couple of years [noise]\nUm in terms of reducing their co pays for this war was reducing their marriage from out of pocket for they still have the widest network in terms of providers here near recovered virtually every hospital worker\nThat's right I think what they've done is they've said they want to really listen to their members\nWhat people need and what benefits people really want to see improved and they're making the effort to make those changes United healthcare in essence still offer excellent benefits and will be discussing them in the upcoming weeks because we have several clients utilizing those policies as well\nBut this gives a nice option for individuals who are using the traditional supplements want to try out of Medicare Advantage plan without a lot of risk to them see how it works and if they like it they get to stay and if not they get to go back without any penalty\nYeah and it's interesting because many of the folks I Know that you talked to in the past um [noise]\nYou know either they've heard across the border from the water cooler from friends or whatever that you know Medicare Advantage plans were so great but for those folks that I'm a ... even if their physicians were covered in the work that way I was like this is a great way for them to transition and once they find out\nThat there are always seeing their doctors anywhere because eventually want to make that next move to the to the HMO benefits\nThey get to reduce their liability even further\nWhich is which is awesome and we're really talking about this thing with a referrals because you know when we use the word ... most folks that are that are thinking about a ... really eligible for these players [noise] it really goes back to the beginnings of\nI'm amused her shoes it was very restrictive and networks were small you have this you have to call and you know you had to get a hearing referral you had to get it from your primary end up paying a copay before you see a specialist it really doesn't work like that anymore does\nIt does not um United healthcare several years ago just developed what was called the open access HMO and basically what that did was open the doors for more the multiple hospital system multiple physician groups to join different HMO style plans\nAnd really give them to participate more choice in their in their physician networks\nWhat it also did was as technology has developed over time the Medicare Advantage plans do not require with HMOs style do not require that you go into your primary\nHave them check you out get the referral wretched and then you take it to the specialist you just call the primary and say hey I'd like to go see whomever\nThey electronically generate the referral for you it shows up at the specialist off as you call it make it an appointment with your specialist you don't have to see the primary\nThey're legally required to give you as many referrals if you want to as many physicians if you want you can't be restricted so\nIt's really quite different and really what it does is it mirrors help people utilize health care anyway when you go into the your primary and you have your blood work done and they say oh Mr Smith I think maybe it's time that you take a look you might see a cardiologist\nYou don't say okay I'm going to go home and look went up in the phone book you say well you know primary who do you suggest\nThey make or if they make a suggestion to you that that is like a referral you're just not completing the whole process which would be walking out to the nurse and saying hey could you please make the referral for me Dr Smith recommended this cardiologist\nThey would do that for you like try to send it over to this specialist an ad that individual becomes your new one of your new physician Daniel you just call the primary and say hey I Need my referral shut up again to see my cardiologist\nAnd they'll do it electronically no questions asked show it really is pretty simple but if you're not ready for that\nTried out the PPOs at great ... great alternative ah we have now the phone lines are just lighting up with pat has been so patiently holding on line one to the Social Security question to morning\nIt's health insurance question too sure\nOkay I worked thirty four years for the federal government I retired in Nineteen Ninety four one day after my birthday and I work for your time in order to get Social Security okay\nI only get one third of what I paid for Social Security I started out at sixteen dollars a month from now three by\nMy insurance is thirty four dollars a month for the difference right okay I was married for nine years I made more money than my access get nothing from him and my question is\nSecondary insurance through the government Blue Cross Blue Shield cheap but it goes up every year so next year it'll be sixty seven star Seventy two dollars a month so I'm just wondering if maybe I should switch I urge Kevin tree\nFor going to come up and\nSo I'm probably get a Blue Cross Blue Shield you can't find ever go back I can never go back\nDo what my recommendation would be is it that sounds like you are a prime candidates to for to have a review of your health insurance benefits you what we want to take a look at what the hundred and sixty seven dollars a month and buying needs for Blue Cross Blue Shield\nAt what the alternative options could be through a Medicare Advantage plan it may be common tree or maybe one of the other plans fits you well\nYou better and has a equal or benefits that are going to match what you need so I Would suggest 'em sit a scheduling some time to sit down with someone like myself to review those choices\nAnd with someone like myself to review those choices because like you said this is a big decision for you because you can't get back into your old benefits but if you find something you like better you'll never want to go back so you want to make sure that you have a nice good clarity on what you're doing before you make the jump\nMaking a point when I was with your best which was a very much because I don't match but anyway I Would like to sit down with you and have you with me because\nI was kind of switched since two years ago and is the last man and I feel that the government is a very good insurance okay I'm a fix everything with Dr no no Dr phil the only thing I've ever had to pay for for Sam\n... well that we would love to see you in the office anytime before December seventh to make that potentially talked about making that switch\nWillpower against thank you so much and you know it's easy for you to get a hold of us if you like uh just give us a call through one for each six three zero zero zero eight or send us email ... for Iran actually be off the nature of calm as we already have your do\nOr we did at least a All right and now we have Bob he's on line three and he had a question about the economic climate right now It's MORNING bop\nGood morning we notice voice hoarse\nAfter Marty asked you that hey wonderful economic fighting in\nDenver and drought have signed exchanges or what is the market\nWell Bob I'll tell you\nI guess from a from a political point of view you would you would wander you know what would be bad or if the if the Republicans lose the house of representatives which you know which is up in the air at this point it would probably create gridlock obviously just like we saw his last term in the Obama years\nIf the Republicans lost the Senate in the house then um I don't know it might be fun to be watching\nTV again because we certainly will see a shootout between the president to make you have an incoming call I guess we do you think that anybody would I Can't believe anybody would cost us or at\nThe house that's nice sorry I've got I've got a ... I got to St Louis cause that were needed our elite a call ... here as if you actually want to talk to their coach on on the air tankers cell phone\nExactly I Can't believe somebody got my super super cell phone number anyway but um you know I think what we really need to do is take a look at really what the underlying economics or or what's happening is that we're seeing trade the trade deal certainly get renewed\nBut surely which is very positive thing you know unemployment is down to three point seven percent or ... I Would say that I'm at this point a recession is really nowhere in sight because of the economic\nYou know the bottom line is is that this last week was certainly emotional thing for everybody in terms of the you know the Kavanaugh hearings him getting hopefully by the but sometime this why depending on your viewpoint he's a he's probably going to go on to become one of the Supreme Court justices record so the truth is we always have stuff going on\nProviding full service coalition and mechanical repair using the latest technology and equipment to restore your vehicle to its original condition\nOur car trade technicians are just a phone call or click away direct repair shop for most insurance companies and car dealers Patty is your one stop auto collision engine entire center providing the highest quality guarantee on work and ship all repairs re pick up and delivery was twenty four hour chilling available open Monday through friday eight to five\nFor directions and follow the daily progress every vehicle repairs on line ... ... dot com\nSaluting our great country and honor in support\nGo to Ernie petty collision dot com\nSaluting our great country and honor and support the men and women who allow us our freedom thank you for your service\nHave a question for you what to foreign companies have been in St Louis favorite since Nineteen\nThirty nine and give up and carrots and Midwest more that I'm Brian mugging president and CEO of mid watch for for years Midwest war and care stand hip team together to make the month of October national ...\nIf you've ever dreamed of owning a care than carpet and now is the ... dam quite simply make the minus purpose made in America\nIn Midwest Florida's a kerosene gallery dealing which means you will find no better selection of sand products anywhere in during national charity among you'll find all chairs carpeted rugs a significant loss even rebate directly from care stem from one thousand dollars to drop by during national care than among for great saving\nUp to a thousand dollar cash back\nLeaving mid level or rambling chosen for online and mid West Florida ...\n... since Nineteen thirty nine [noise]\nSince Nineteen Seventy four homeowners and the greatest Saint Louis area trusted permit jak more than any other contractor when their houses settling\nAnd buckling law to your call when you notice water in the basement\nWill face also permit jak the representatives of Burma jak are extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of foundation repair including leaky basements from a jak provides permanent solutions to all your nagging order problems whether it's a simple crackers here for a comprehensive dream system they will make sure your basement remains dry\nAnd jump back it up with a written guarantee for home settling problems\nAnd buckling laws for if you have a leaky basement call the company St Louis has trusted for over Thirty years of my jak\nCalled permit jak today at six thirty six two to five twenty five fifty three sets six three six two to five twenty five fifty three family owned and operated since Nineteen Seventy four when you're building needs a helping hand solid as or a ... to five twenty five fifty three\nFrom the Piccadilly Manhattan here to let you know about our did that in\nAll of them are made in how many like we have black very ... year round and red tape three seasonal flavors like beach cherry strawberry rhubarb in apple and we also had a decadent branding Sunday plastic and you could forget our Chantilly lace died that would be very mixed in with cream on top of that ice cream\nPuff pastry where's the as soon as they could only Manhattan\nB opinions you hear on T.
