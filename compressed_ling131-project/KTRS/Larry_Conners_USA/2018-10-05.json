N. A. D. N. A. G. string we share with us but we don't have the thing that a ... and the strange so it's a ... founded the richer sound\nThis weekend you are the soloist in a barely a speech Harold in Italy which I had not heard of before but does not saying much\nBe Harold in Italy which I had not heard of before but does not saying much uh I Know what I Know when I got hurt by this piece for people like me that maybe are the more casual a participant or observer what does barely does she have to offer what would excite you about it\nAnd I guess there is so much to love about this piece even without being the soloist right now it is one of my favorite pieces and music when I first heard it when I first learned it I became totally obsessed and just listen to it on repeat and I would walk around without music playing and just hearing it because while the melodies are so\nBeautiful and\nSome of it is so quirky and cool and interesting you will hear sound that you maybe never hurt in an orchestra and it's not because it's a modern piece this was written around the time of Mendelssohn so it's\nClassical music classical classical music it's romantic but it's cool it's got like flavor to it I Would say\nYou know it was written what Eighteen thirty ... around that period of time [noise]\nMhm yeah that's exactly right\nThe little bit of research year ago and like I Know what I'm Talking with a little bit of research and talk to my barely us kind of wandering around the hills of Italy and that's his experience\nYeah so it's called Harold in Italy but it's really a stand in for Hector that's his name their\nVarious he loved to go like backpacking and he loves to meet the local people and just try to see what their life was like in kind of refer places\nSo one of the movements is about breaking it it's pretty crazy that's the last time we went another is about the march of the pilgrims it's much more churchgoing sounding it's gorgeous the first movement is about the brick the mountains and some of it as a ... and melancholy 'cause I think he was lonely\nAnd then he finds how beautiful it is and it's it's happy music and then the last section is even in titled joy and it's just literally bull remain with joy and music\nSounds beautiful now you're quite talented the received a a an artist diploma from the New England conservatory your bachelors masters and music from Juilliard how does one become the soloist in a piece like this was a major orchestra light to St Louis symphony orchestra is it just sheer talent or did you win the lottery\nMaybe a little bit of ... um\nBasically just like with any incredibly high I'm missing the word here any anything where you have to have a lot of talent you also need to have luck and so what I Would say is I work really hard I work my butt off\nSure there are a lot of me this is out there who dead but I just I put myself out there and I kept trying and that meant that I had a lot of successes so many successes but I also had way more\nThan [laughter] and I think that's just the way it was\nEven in classical music you used to having failures I mean we hear about that in other fields using classical music maybe you're saved from that but it's not it's very competitive out there\nYes I mean to win an audition for an orchestra so we just had a distance last year for one year job in the symphony and the viola section and that so that means it's not a tenure track jobs one your job over two hundred and fifty people applied and we had three spots that's not a very good present\nIt right now we're\nWay more qualified people than jobs available and this is a one year job at the end of the year maybe we'll be able to offer them some sub sub work but we can't offer them a contract after that and it shows you how difficult it is to get a job in classical music\nSure and then again you were a principal with the simply which means you were there currently you in fact have an Endowed Chair in Egypt cancer ...\nPart of what I was asking on the the solo piece was barely oh says it's just something you performed many times before there is a kind of a level where snow musicians to specialize in a particular composer over a period it's just something you perform previously\nThough I have luckily gotten could play this before um I played it when I was actually er and I wanted to concerto competition there so I but there are only played it with our principal heart player elect a liquor Lilly or principle that wow\nAnd yeah and that was that's Fifteen Years ago she was a freshman and I would I don't know I Can't even remember but um\nIt's really cool to get to play this peace again it is not played that often it's essentially both a concerto so it's features me but it's also really a symphony or not it really features the orchestra\nSo it's a little awkward to program that and I'm so excited they did because the orchestra seemingly loves it so far and I think the audience is going to love it\nGood we're speaking with is the best good Herman chew she's the principal violist at the St Louis symphony orchestras she's going to be the soloist this weekend\nIn a program that features Beethoven symphony number six pastoral and sector burly doses Harold in Italy steps friday night and Saturday Night now I understand they've given you the rest of the night off and do you play your little fingers right down to the bone as a soloist\nBut the orchestra is playing Beethoven symphony number six which is better known why it's just such a fan favorite\nOh my goodness that's really cool I think about the concert is that Harold is going on this tour of Italy but the the panther party is probably one of the first known\nMore\nNumerous stories with our best friends is Roman haven as to how are you\nPaying good how are you a spectacular aged you go to the symphony very often I haven't been in a while\nYeah we uh we're regular seeing now we're going to talk with simply on this we're really question it up ... percent new stories with you we have some uh Lyndon house was movie reviews we have a musicians from the from the St Louis symphony orchestra\nI Love this company I mean it's it's it's a wonderful\nYeah we do you know when you when you talk about things in St Louis\nUm that we have and you can point to the zoo and you can point to the same or those\nSometimes the people overlook the symphony and again the sympathies not just let's go here you know actor barely ... and Beethoven that's great that's wonderful but let's go listen to the Harry Potter score well we weren't we let's go down and do the the um the Christmas\nSongs to concerts or there's so much that they do it's really\nThey're really stepping it up and then they had like I think they did the music of print\nThat they have and what did they did they do to that now that would have been there they didn't do the Grateful Dead he recently did they I think Tom Petty or did Tom Petty\nRiver because I see their advertisements and I'm like and I'm always thinking oh I Need to go on but you know what it's it's now it's going on my left because whenever I get terrorists from town on the ... where to go out and is now going on\nYeah it's really cool and simply home I mean it's a great fun and a tooth decay is wonderful and it's just and we were talking about it with a ... who is best ...\nIt's not the kind of place where anyone's ever going to feel uncomfortable you can be as dressed as you want is owned dressed as well to a point let's not go re each um but it really there is no pretense necessarily when it comes to hanging out at DePaul simply home everyone's welcome\nThat beautiful now let's hear [noise] All right take anybody there every year dropping the are\nNow um [laughter] that's so funny because um yeah I had a guy that was All right it was really the joy of fries remember that the story I was going to tell them you know we got time for both stores\nSo um I picked up a guy\nWho um this is like this is during the day and he was going over to the symphony because um there was a there was a girl that worked there and it just started dating a love story I Love it yeah\nAnd he was so nervous she invited me to death on ... and I don't know if it's going to be a pain or if she likes me so we just had this really you know I started the gas station he could get salary they kiss and water\nBecause he was a young love yea okay he\nTalked about how much um he liked her and how it was just how has smart she was and how well put together she was not an obvious like what I noticed that the way he talks about her was not like you know\nA lot of times you can tell them that you're being superficial because she's super hot or she is ...\nI Wonder when you said she was well put together that's what I was wondering so you're saying intellectually [noise]\nYes he was not just having heat I you know he did say that she was beautiful but he was thinking about her as a whole person mhm out which was really nice to hear\nAnd he was out there like ... and you can tell that get a guy really like somebody because they are like a fish\nEvery every little thing are so cute cute yeah\nNo I mean I just like say they don't have it and talk with him about you know I'm not real with\nHer kids and kids\nYou know heavy respectful unreal and all those things

fight than every other mom is having the same fight with her six you know draw like just trying to get them to understand like there's nothing to be ashamed of there's this is what it is how people act as what people talk about\nAnd if we talk about it I said I Want you to know how many times I'm On stage and I tell some story and and you know you can just see like a wife hitting her husband like the totally what you did like you just and\nI'm like yeah I Know you don't understand it I said but and I have two daughters have a son and two daughters and um this is a lot it's a lot to balance between being home being on the road um but you just see that you know we have a lot of young moms that come to the show and you know it's funny and it makes you face her and your appear pan says a lot of fun\nUm but there's a great message about you know finding your mom tried like this can be a very lonely time it's not easy and you have to find you have to find these people that are willing to kind of\nShare their stories and make you feel like it's like if you're like hysterical and a CBS parking lot you're probably doing motherhood right like you are probably fine you should tell somebody and talk it through\nUm but it's not going to get better like this is it now like we're all trying our best\nI think isn't that the truth if it is if it seems like it's going just fine like there's no problems then you're probably not digging in your mouth and taking a closer look at it\nLike that um when you're worried all the time I'm starting to my mom and I was one of those kids that was it I wasn't a horrible kid but I bet that was a bad kid I was a bad seed um but my mom she said we need to do things for the way we could we always knew you were going to do All right we just we just knew that the ... do you want\nTo go to the ... made me ... your father not closer together because we became allies ensue and fish that you know and we used to lay in bed and just say oh please don't let the phone ring please don't live the phone rang [laughter]\nUm but then you know you look back I guess and just say to you know everything worked out OK yeah\nAnd I pray that you get a child's life too [laughter] that's how we all get attack at our children [noise] um so where do people find you a blizzard word anything one funny mother so you can forget one time on the dot com and kind of see all the things that we do we have one other store where we have our products like started NATO and some other fun things\nUm and then we're on Facebook we're barely big on Facebook but how do people find this tipsy Tuesday and they\nDo they talk at nine pm eastern ATM\nHere um and uh yeah you just got to show up ... something about men can I go yeah absolutely a bra you thank you on your own we're halfway there and he laughed and you're damned okay\nUm but yeah you know and even going back to the show like the need a lot of people are like oh these ladies love the show on my husband's loved it out you know I feel like you go there was one guy years ago during my stand up he was like you know I came here and I I used to just take my wife was crazy and I'm starting to think you're all\n... and like we are so not better do more than just going to be better trained staff does belittle just got to deal with it\nBut it was the same color on the other thing I say so did you find that um\nWhen you're putting these videos out one of the things as I listen to you in in the number of comedians that come through here uh-huh you of tapped into a way of getting out in reaching out to people that uh is difficult for some how did you find this path or was it I mean did you say I see it you know do I see now very pretty much have you on it I still\nHave all it's funny because uh you know to your point of lots of comedian friend we always talk about like do you know just so happy things are really starting to offer you you know like you know how did you figure it out and like I just got a glass of wine and went live and I was like how'd I noticed ten years ago this could've been good quite a bit of drinking\nMyself for a long time I turn on the Internet on 'em so yeah I mean it really started um\nYou know I was doing stand up I was doing radio and I was doing some TV things um but you know the Internet was happening and so um I said demands and let's just start making videos and uh\nThey were awful you know we probably have made hundreds of them and many of them we've turned off [laughter] so awful but the very first one we ever did\nUm what's called cops and it was just me and my kids and in my kitchen because they just have all summer I literally think in the summer they get a cup they look at\nAnd then they're not gonna take to the top and then they'll take bold and little the look on the London saying one of the water so I gather them around and\nI was like this is how you fix this problem you gather all the cops and you make them watch you lick every single one of them all up and it was just so ridiculous um but it was a huge success you know and so\nWe just kept putting content out like I'm a big believer staying with stand up I mean your job as a comedian is just keep writing jokes and finding out what kind of connect with people and I believe it's the same thing with video and you know just kind of putting things out and that's why when she started they go\nWent crazy it did go like a little better than our videos like it blew all of our ... up until that point I think one of our videos had four hundred thousand is a cold wind and tampons\nThe whole thing but there were like water for their views and I\nThings or my son he's\nOut he was Seventeen at the time he started making videos and I was like so do you want me to give you some shows there you're like mom\nYeah you don't really know what you're doing I'm like I have four hundred thousand years I'm pretty sure he's like you've never gone viral I go I don't know four hundred thousand seems viral he's like you're not viral and then literally two weeks later started NATO happened and so we were around like seven million views and I go ... I was like\nSo feeling I was like now seven million viral I go I\nLike it's viral embed he ... he was like no no no it's not just sometime around like the twenty million mark I was like by fire all he was like\nMom it's just it's knocking at your my mom and it's not going to matter of being ever going to be right and then a year later we did the back to school ran and all he was like I didn't give me a million views so maybe I'll listen\nNow I don't know ... but I Do I think I think it's every ... you know artists performer comedians job to you know kind of take that same philosophy of just kind of putting things into the universe and um and I think you do eventually I mean from the time we made our first video\nI think it was ten years ago and it really didn't hit start hitting until two years ago we started and they go and so\nYou know I think it's like you know when you when you started as a comedian people will say it'll take you ten years to kind of find your voice and find your perspective um and so the same thing with kind of true with our videos and um and I do find that if you can look at the scope of our videos um it's the ones where I was just you know just very passion I walked by my daughter's room one day\nAnd I had a laundry basket and I\nCould do that quick look in the bedroom and she passed and there was just a glass of water under her bed and I was like what I Do live again on my hot\nAnd then I get on my hands and knees and they're seven more glass had been completely ... my mind I don't like a million views on it and you're like some silly it's finding that but you realize every mom in America has started what's this under the bed and then\nYou get into that you're like mind right now um and you do you start to see that these things that make you crazy are so universal you you think that your story is so unique and you're like it's really not\nAnd it helps you to laugh about that too when I when they say if you if you don't laugh you'll\nCry yeah I mean that's very true with everything I you know I think that's like my daughter has some special needs and we talk about it a lot on the show I think it's very difficult and and you know ours is a very small and the scope of things is\nA lot of comprehension and ADD and an extra tricked stream anxiety um but we talk about it and my daughter will say you know why why do you tell people\nBecause there's nothing wrong with you and we're going to talk about it because there's nothing wrong with her you know we do we have a huge follower of following of of parents of children with special needs and trying to find something in that arena not so funny\nUm and so it's harder it's harder to find that funny and that but you've got to try or you know at least find your\nUm and so it's harder it's harder to find that funny or not but you've got to try or you know at least find your community and people say oh I'm so everything we do whether it's our board game or their show it's always about you know bringing women together bringing people together and just kind of talking about that crazy nuts I'm trying to find it funny\nYeah and so you are here in New ... is the second\nTime around the country as a yeah yeah since that time we were off Broadway yeah so you guys are the first city for us and then we'll go to San Antonio Charlotte can activity\nYou get back to this day and ... so we'll be on the road for the next couple of weeks and well it is\nDina blizzard she's all over the Internet you hurt or go find her the DNA blizzard and it is tipsy Tuesday a but here in St Louis is right across from World headquarters here at the Westport playhouse a it is one funding mother ...
