free quite a woman show as you said before\nAnd I'm at I'm\nIs a variety show so ah there are many languages that are makes like dance physical comedy a theater and circus and especially comedy and I'm against participation because I'm a clown\nYou got your view became involved in the circus and I when I say circus I mean it and the the most respected\nKind of a broader a performance is who you became involved in circus as as a clown yeah how did that happen\nA it up and because it was doing theater and cinema in Paris of working with the the ... company and\nNow now you guys talk funny you have an accent you're from Alabama [laughter] to where you from I'm from LA lamb\nMonterey is a very small town in the ... between that on our land that comes from and or don't ya [laughter] so north\nEast and wonderful and beautiful country\nYou talked about a ... the clown Institute in Spain and say now is there I thought there was the used to be the ringing ringing brothers Barnum Bailey kind of the clown school yeah that'd be the equivalent or am I giving them too much credit here in this country and not enough over there\nWell these are they're very different than a which is better than the ... school was a\n... long before ringing folded they folded the school I forget what year but you know like Twenty years ago or something or but it went from the late sixties up to about the turn of the century or edit it was just um it was a\nSix to eight week program or that they used to train and recruit of clowns for their ... specifically for their show a\nFrankly clowns we're getting paid terrible so most of them quit it was like a hundred and fifty dollars a week or so but you know the so it was a big third over uh I\nI think a lot of their training some of it was good depending which year was who was teaching at a lot of it was a bit of external up for my taste of\nThe new book cloud Institute in Barcelona something or the program the Django Edwards is pretty the actually from Detroit but lived in Europe was fifty years or so or set up and that was very\nEclectic because of the time that I taught in the end but ... was like a month long program but\nThe teachers were each they're only for like two or three days and you don't just taught nonstop for two or three days so the students got exposed to like ten different styles and bright and then they could take what they you know what works for them and the birth or from there\nAnd now it's surprising that in your background you you came up through theater and and regular your stunningly beautiful okay I mean you just got that that look a little see speaking\nTo [laughter] John you are starting to see your\nEveryday stage manager has to say in the country is that the stage manager that's to say to the director daddy steering\nWheel that if he is beautiful I think that's the only reason you're hiring [laughter] [laughter] ... and the reason I pointed out is um\nYeah it seems a little um you know for you than they used it would seem that you would be more better suited for you know having that bit beauty out there and yet are you one of those clowns that covers up with makeup is that part of a clown world now that's just our American style clown or\nSometimes I make up because uh especially when I have to when I went to the task something new I I make up our act but then now is on because I feel more safe or its depend every time is different in depends maybe after a wider right or not\nYeah I always hate law that I had to wear a knows if you're a clown is that not true [laughter] that's a state by state yeah [noise] yeah I mean what makes a good clown I mean what what do you have for their freedom [laughter]\nUm um how you say a daring barrier and yeah I like a lot I like both on a lot um\nI Know it's different here from Europe better to find that the yeah so you know the lines are very um teens so I don't know but I like to to go strong blade\nYeah I like to say things direct place that has to say if if I if I don't talk I have to have a ... relationship with children mhm like no\nIt's not a chain rent is just a person a human being\nI I found clowns ... not only speak to children obviously they speak to children because they're great they can bring them into that world\nBig the children because they're great they can bring them into that world um but adults to look at the clowns that have been a part of the circus that I Know the best which a circus Flora and some of the people um and\nAnd again those that you speak to not only children but to adults as well yeah\nYeah yeah ... ... ... s and maybe it's more risky to a dollar for sure it is because ... will aren't willing to open up and and and allow somebody in and to be funny and to to

fight this weekend\nUm and then um is it\nWhat was it was uh what was his name\nConor McGregor that was the ... but the craziest fight was a fabulous no I'm a judge Kavanaugh versus all\nOf that one that one was crazy talk or do we have Nicole ... hey Nick Pope is is with us how are you this evening ms ... thank you very much\nYou know I'm a A R a\nCelebrity I'm no doubt used to run the British government's UFO project I'm you are the world's leading expert on UFOs you were an author a consultant you consulted on movies and TV shows in video games um you're the person to go to when it comes to UFOs\nActually yeah I did this I Hope it as a government job back in the u._k.\nYet let's start right there was pope because I don't know that many people I don't know anybody else who's ever said you know I ran a a government UFO project you used to run the British government's UFO project talk about what that entails\nWell we got about two or three hundred report the chair and my job was to investigate them\nIf there was evidence of any to the defense of the United kingdom or anything of general defence so scientific in track so if I had to do that I had to handle the on the subject to talk on there all the difficult questions when they came from members of parliament to the media\nNow you left that job in two thousand and six and they've been doing other things since one of the things that you've been working on\nHis to declassify some of the documents from the u._k. project this is a more general question which is why governments like the u._k. like the United states ... why did they tried to keep us information hidden\nWell the on to that it's because the [noise] the documents and things like the capability of military radar systems like at the conspiracy theory believe we don't go to any of these things in a way and ask for\nTelling us what\nDid they get into discussion about military capabilities and wherever we think the UFO phenomenon is there are people who say well look even if it turns out to be some exotic atmospheric plasma phenomenon which was one of the theories during the round\nWe could maybe weaponize it do you do get into it is a highly classified material\nNow you say hand hard I'm kind of jokingly but I Know you you mean that did as far as you know in the u._k. government it does not have a a UFO and a hanger let me ask you about other governments now the United states do you believe that any of\nAnd I don't find them sometimes\nUm that I agree with them but for the most part I Want to pull my hair I was little I have left trying to explain to people that\nUm you know nine eleven was not an inside job and you cannot keep thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people why it when they're\nThousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people why it when they're the mere fact that they speak out would be worth millions and millions of dollars to them you know it's been a lot of time looking you conspiracy theories and I'd love to hear your take on them\nWhy I agree with you I get frustrated too I think it goes to the heart to some interesting things about the psychology of belief\nBut one thing that I think run through a lot of conspiracy theory just mistrust of the government look every now and then absolutely of course a conspiracy theory will turn out to be true so for example people said that the government secretly reading all our emails\nAnd then of course comes along and said wait\nA minute they they probably are seems seems we were right but then all the other thing nine eleven\nOr the moon landings hold I kind of stuff I think it's just it's a mixture between science fiction and paranoia and evidently you can look at a lot of these things on disapprove them ... by critical thinking\nAnd basic science for example when the astronauts went to the moon they left to reflect to that\nSort of a science lab can fire a laser at this thing and it'll bounce back and you can measure the distance between the U.S and the moon down to the ... millimeter will always have to put the thing out there and set it up and the first place\nYou know why is it than that so many people want so desperately to believe that we for example didn't go to the moon than to the United states and um you know\nI'm In the ... the Jewish people not the Jewish people handle the Jews created nine eleven why do people want to believe that\nI think psychologists still trying to figure it out psychologists psychiatrists I mean it's it's the human mind is I suppose pretty much the most difficult thing to to\nUnderstand we don't really know but but again I think he has to do with some sort of um deep fearing deep deep seated mistrust\n... um that that must be something going on behind people's backs but they don't [noise]\nI I think ... Powell ... is a part of it people feel that that that does seem power then that the ... the thing more that they can't see so they can try these grateful now chefs and unfortunately the Internet as\nAs I got was the thing to spread out of control\nWhat do you have to say about those folks won't even use the name we all know who he is um been him monetize it just really almost destructive conspiracy theories out there on the Internet\nI think most time something like that it's quite\nQuite cynical and it just plays\nAnd to [noise] uh I I think the the the is the paranoia or people so it's a very real sense I think it\nIt's going to offend a lot of these people I mean there have been occasions where people have kind of weapons and going and shot a pizza parlors because they think that that they're at the center of some nefarious government conspiracy involving\nChild sexual trafficking and those sorts of things so that the dark side to all of this and you mentioned the whole point about the Jewish question there's no getting away from the fact that this uh\nOn the healthy streak of anti Semitism running through a lot of these conspiracy theories whip people use phrases like small group of um an international families secretly ruling the ... the global banking conspiracy on what they really mean is cheers\nRight right um you also I've written a number of things that you've written you indicated studies have shown that people didn't are likely to believe conspiracy theories are likely to\nBully irreconcilable versions of the same so I Can't remember the the example you use but I'm the same you know the nine eleven either did\nWell I'm Sorry to pick the shooting in Connecticut for example that the government then we put on by the government the school shooting or that it didn't even occur and all the bully both of those and yet the emir reconcilable\nYes I mean again it's just a clue that there is some kind of psychic pathology play with some of this\nA belief and of course the conspiracies about the the school shootings for example in the mass\nSpray shooting up beyond insulting I mean can you imagine the grief of of the parents and then right to be told on the Internet that that they said they were all part of a of the coin being traded on on the community and they didn't really lose that that capital\nWell no it's beyond a reprehensible right absolutely\nSo what how do you explain to folks and there's been a good friend did you believe in these conspiracy theories and and I and I try not to to judge too much you scratch my head with them because they're good friends as opposed to pulling out my here but\nHow do you then go to them and say scientifically this just can't happen logically it can happen how do you address those when you around speaking to groups are reading your articles\nIt's very difficult with the hard core conspiracy theorists you will never watch them um because if somebody like me comes and tries to explain something they'll they'll just call me an evil government ... anyway\nYeah they do believe you worked for the government trying to hide UFOs\nTypically I mean you could go on to the Internet there phrases like Nick ... still secretly works out in the ... but\nBut the one shift the hard core conspiracy believe it but there are some people in the middle who I think if you could just\nPolitely engage with them rather than like you but politely engage and say look at some of the good sources of information um ... for example with the moon landings came to the lunar reflect to is\nThat I mentioned and and you read the nine eleven commission report so many people that talk about nine eleven have read the nine eleven commission report should raising\nSure um and again I always get back to the point nine eleven on June ... on the moon landing\nAgain the size of the conspiracy we can't even keep what is published in an FBI reporting about judge Kavanaugh quiet for more than sixty minutes after its release\nIt they're going to keep a conspiracy the size of JFK or nine eleven or any of these others quiet in Washington it it makes no sense\nNow it seems it seems to stretch credulity beyond breaking point\nYeah Nick pulled a fascinating and thank you so much for joining us where are you in addition to Nick dot net where else can people find you read you and and and learn more about you\nWell Nick dot net has gotten most of my stuff but I just put out a DVD called aliens at the Pentagon if people\nWant to say on that phrase that's about the the Pentagon's UFO program literally with discussing\nThe the Graham literally see again while\nNick Pope Mick poked thank you so much for being with\nYou but I'm All right there you go everything you wanted to know about UFOs and conspiracy theories I just I don't believe that um\nWhat's his name uh killed the JFK by himself\nWhat's on your Harvey Oswald yeah yeah that too now beyond that\nI think there was probably a couple of guys maybe there were involved but beyond a couple of guys know that we didn't have all of the secret service and the CIA and Johnson and and my friend Bryan Sexton would go crazy and say I know I don't get it and I I'm not naive but [noise]\nUm no the the Harvey Oswald could not fire off three shots could do it but\nThe government could not keep anything more than a couple of three guys quiet for more than a few minutes let's take a quick break come back we'll talk about our number three on all access which can flip\nIt happens all the time you're driving down the highway
