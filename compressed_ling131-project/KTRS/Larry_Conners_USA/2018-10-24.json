November ... congratulations so let's start with you as a judge beach\nOkay well the treatment court to for veterans is a program in which a someone who has been charged with a non violent felony or can be anything as long as that non violent or has an opportunity to plead into our court\nOr the prosecuting attorney works with is we have a defense counsel we have a team of people including a probation officer and someone from the VA\nA and that team has is bad guys as every week with the with all of our\nVeterans and what we do is if they get through the program which is a minimum of Fifteen months and they must go through that program and Fifteen listed as first phases you work from the bottom on up to four phases and if you get through the program then you're ... able to drop your charges\nAnd in that process or trying to do is is to help the personnel the individual we work on stuff like that like work we work on drug testing we work on medical issues or compete TST we try to work on the housing we try to make their allies of whole and and what ever need that they may have\nSo we have everybody that are people that have been homeless and may be in the but they called a\n... area which is at the VA and or people that are in at families are engaged in their kids and they found themselves in trouble\nRight now you are a a an ex marine there's no such\nThing that I oughta every day I came out of my mouth I say you were a marine and I'm remembering that day it\nAt a twenty three years combined active in retail\nEnemies are ... there was something I'm very uh special for you I mean it was close to use you saw properly and a lot of these people are folks that you'd known over the years maybe you'd served with um that had come out and it it didn't get right back on their feet maybe like you did leaving the service\nOr have really a what I\nFeed maybe like you did leaving the service\nUh really uh\nWhat I had is I had a friend of mine we're in the Marines together on active duty and he was up in ... in Minnesota and he's a judge up there and he had started a program the program actually started back in the late nineties in Buffalo New York for the non veteran judge who saw veterans kept showing up in his courtroom\nOr in his ... was a veteran and so I went to visit my friend on just on regular visit and he had this program I went there\nAnd the one thing that the the kind of sets the veterans' courts of part is that they have mentors and the mentors are\nIndividuals which are have military experience who have probably had such similar issues of of drug or alcohol issues they've had the TST issues and and they are like a sponsor but the fact that we're all in the military have that military background gives a certain camaraderie that really as as health I think make the program work\nDid you develop a an addiction quickly after leaving the military\nI did I did yes like I came back and um I was in for two thousand three to two thousand seven so I was deployed numerous times and just coming back and\nKind of not knowing you know where my place was in the world are what are we supposed to do and I had all this anger and didn't know what to do with it and was having a hard time holding down jobs my temper was getting the best of me and uh you know it's kind of\nSelf medicating I go and that just kind of spun out of control and you know it's a vicious cycle like you were saying\nLet me ask you this and this a little bit off topic topic but I think it it it relates to this did you find that you were able to um go somewhere to do with your problems before the drug treatment court in other words\nOr the programs readily available to you through the V. A. or other places um and did you feel comfortable going to them\nI have to go into the VA but I did um that was something that uh I have a father really has always kind of helped me out and one of the things he did when I was in my active edition was he quit helped me out he caught me off and one thing that he do anytime I'd show up and go you're ready to go down to the hospital and I you know it's\nOne of the other either get outta here I'll give you ride to the hospital [noise] ah yeah the um the resources were available but I think they're kind of extra push it you know it\nYour first time going through treatment kind are waiting for eureka moment that something gets or do you or something happens that goes out that's what was missing and now I can you know live this way for the rest of my life and it doesn't work that way you know it's kind of I mean it takes time and it takes longer for some people in those for others and for me it took quite a bit of time so\nPick you and I long tend to get the last ... yeah my when I was in phase one in the program but there was kind of touch and go for a while there were\nA let's say come from a quick break here because we're not come back I Want you to view the three of you to walk through the program you talk about the phase one the phase two what are you trying to do how does that happen what's easy what's difficult and and how did you get to where you are\nWe're speaking with a judge a Doug beach Paul and St Louis ...

this year\nSo I'm going to show my ignorance here but I'm going to jump on a limb and never stopped me before the uh the day of the dead is that somehow we got Halloween or somehow connected\nTo my to my knowledge understanding is that now that they're not ... I'm going so then there is that piece November first at all and ... and the rates as I should know down here there\nAre sure there are smarter I'm sort of rooted in traditional that the indigenous peoples of Latin America mhm\nOn which would include that gas tax and then the tradition for really influenced by Spanish particularly Catholic culture\nWhen the fish started coming on the area and so it's it's just kind of a unique um tradition for his future and a lot of different people over time\nIt it sounds like a lot of fun let's talk about the activities and where this is all taking place\nYeah so I began in the whole the whole building really come alive or dead [laughter] I'm like I Love to say\nThat I'm really he couldn't find\nThem more likely to say\nOne of them are bachelor thing throughout the weekend is that alters are set up a friend that Spanish word ...\nOur alters that are built to honor a specific person or possibly ... a few people on them to celebrate their lives you might see anything on the alters I'm at the pictures of that people at that person\n... men and you know a seven there they are right [laughter] the\nNumbers Fifteen twenty three fifty three sixty five Seventy\nAnd that Powerball or make a multiplier mega ball is old seven bingo [laughter] oh seven are there it is my guess is that was at one point six billion at the end of it all my guess is it probably ran a little higher I mean people in my little gas station we're walking down twenty thirty forty bucks\nA for tickets oh yeah I usually go to box and I think that the ten bucks really oh yeah\nWhich I'm getting in theory I can dig in higher yeah well you know in theory it just it doesn't make much sense I don't know exactly how we reduced as my odds may be you know now I'm a five and three hundred million as opposed to one in three hundred million\nI'm it takes you know ... you know tomato tomato it's the same thing I I'm In the end so we'll see um\nI was a walk and walk out the gap fishing today when I looked at the ticket and I was like I don't have a single number of like a one digit number on my ticket and I was like I knew a loss [laughter] see that's the that's completely completely relevant okay the ... what seven yeah I Know it it is that's tomorrow that's\nKnown as the magazine today it's the mega multiplier the mega bull yeah here's the thing is the number in that same odds of one two three four five coming up with a multiplier of ... or the ... of six as any other combination it's all the same odds\nYep it'll always been sort of a second time\nDoing [laughter] I'm just tell people say I mean it's just again you know whether it's the number one the number sixty the odds there all the all the balls they're in there they're not waited any differently he'd ditch you know if you flip a coin and there's it's fifty fifty\nAnd if you every time you flip the coin again it's still fifty fifty eight so I can use this for the Powerball tomorrow no no no no no no no you have to buy another ticket for the Powerball tomorrow\nWith six on you know you can use the tickets\n[laughter] go ahead and try to catch it it\nWas a story we had ... ... oh there was a story the saddest story ever\nThe person who had the winning numbers but it was a week later ... ... you have to wait to cash is when you have one year to cash in a ticket by what this guy or gal had was so the winning numbers ... he had him and he had another ticket and he looked at it and they match\nThe problem was it was from the prior weeks numbers he had\nA you know in a different ticket for a different dry\nOr can you I wouldn't even want to know I wouldn't know what I Would hate to see that\nDid you see I I Want I Want I Want oh my God [laughter] than that you realize you're awake late\n... and he got to go eat crow at everybody is told that I could\nTake it I just I Can't imagine what that must feel like to go from that high to that low\nYou you lock up your weapons truth company or sharp objects huge\nMedicaid whim role play Jay you remember when I told you to take no for ... um the mind if I run your board at\nThe end yeah nope nope nope not going to happen in a while that would be hard to go [laughter] and and then we had I\nForget the stories but we had a whole show on those stories of people you know that a man that did it wrong and that came in and they told the you know had set the person up and actually seen their ticket in advance and said why don't you check your ticket I wrote down the numbers and you know [laughter]\nMy wife was trying to figure out how she could tell work that she's not coming back I wouldn't have any problem well and she she yeah\nI mean I I mean she was coming up with creative way create I oh yeah I
