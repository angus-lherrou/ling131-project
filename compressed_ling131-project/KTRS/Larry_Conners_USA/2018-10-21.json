red\nBull with the official talk but it was clearly a hard fall from behind walls filed by seat and\nThey continue to job pushed and shove and it looks like Tony walls are official is definitely made his decision or now I see a yellow let's see where he's going with the yellow and\nIt was ... one half those on the other so she gets a yellow walls get to read that is an absolutely\nHorrible call by the official total lack of having a feel for the temperature of the game that's at atrocious call by the referee at once again that lose like an opportunity or the influence of a coal by our referee may may affect the outcome of the game\nTakes away all the competitive\nAnd this and that match between the two sides you have to be one hundred percent sure when you make a call like that positive way and the fall originally came from Seton from behind clearly a yellow and then as we see the replay\nA push from seat and\nThen wall says something as he runs away the officials right there you\nCan apps absolutely wrong horrible call by the referee who's inexperienced in a game like this of pressure and Michael seating continues continued to give as much as he got he was warranted read

hangs in the top of the team had it twice and it goes over the goal and of all it's an ad that the second time and a goal kick awarded the St Louis\nSo your goal right now a gym is to try to try to get into the half time interval with only a to nothing disadvantage\nPerhaps change information somewhat\nA maybe a bring on another player perhaps at the sixty is meant it to try to attempt to alter the outcome to get back into the game what's your goal is to get back\nTo the half time interval\nBob played forward by St Louis ... has it works against two defenders approaches the Eighteen at the

from the ball with the ball my number Seventy seven Austin march good through ball player on the ground the diagonal behind defenders by Joey ... so the two white Mitt feelers pinch in\nThat's the way

around last touched by St Louis and throwing on this near wing goes to Orange County\nSt Louis with one of their better chances in Austin march had a chance at a flick on but the defending by Orange County stopped that now St Louis gets another chance\nOf defending thereby Kevin olsten to\nMake that sledding tackle just went off the mark struck it from just inside the penalty area could work to get off the ball away from play coming in off the weak side by number Seventy seven dollars to march\nAnother throw an opportunity for culverts in along the right side said that towards goal headed up

[noise]\nWhen's it momentarily with a hat or but it goes out of bounds and throwing awarded to Orange County\n[noise]\nSo we play late into the night here in St Louis time is nine forty five forty

comes up the near side here and there was it for St Louis is ... tried to deliver a\nService to Michael Cox but it's not the way by Orange County and\nThey'll play it back to their keep her from the ball breaks loose ... through the ... center circle into the channel between the two center backs were normally a front runner would have an opportunity to get on that loose fall and run on to it\nAnd take on one of those last two center ... when the ball was loose inside the center circle\nAgain Orange County will play a bit field amongst the backs crowd now who have held\nOut coming back is eight and Quinn\nWhen patient\n... of all the ground up here I'm In one touch the Joseph on this near side that play the triangle game and play it back\nIn one touch the Joseph on this near side that play\nThe triangle game and play it back and across in the back line at midfield forty first minute of this match long diagnosed ball down the left side too far for beer men in St Louis will get the possession back as I'll get a throwing in the near wing\nSo the ...\nStill information ... left back stamp thing Sean rentals to central defenders Michael Seton has scored two goals who goals tonight that gives him for gene for the overall seasonally at twelve during the regular season\nDespite the fact he's the loan front runner in this for one for all information he is a real handful because he does so much running with out the ball gym which is what you have to do when you're the loan front runner and Satan\nIs chasing now is he causes Lewis Hilton every tree\nWith the possession in a little bit now it's shown Reynolds for St Louis they are going left or right as we move into the forty second minutes St Louis trailing to nothing your patterns\nAnd the overall process of your patterns from what you train and what you do is totally altered without that vital cog of a central midfielder\nAll delivered out by the goalkeeper Raul Z due to the poor service that goes out of bounds on the far side in St Louis will now have a throw at\nLeast remaking the goalkeeper play almost nixed that bought the absolute last moment\nThrowing me go just casually knocked about the roles\nRole for the bad first touching ... almost got on the end of that inside the penalty area\nSo St Louis to throw it in on the left side they'll send it towards the penalty area\nBe nice if they can find a way to get one here ball hangs in the air headed out of there by Orange County\nPossession belonged to chapel on the far side Austin march what how so when's the possession back Polack to Michael Cox lays it back to Louis Elton dealt with a little space middle of the pitch stop some work to the left side in there with it the St Louis a whole lot back to Austin Marts\nGood work by al ... says the chip nonstop work almost ... without the ball\nLost on the left flank traced back wanted back immediately good work from march continually\nYears Tyler ... case filed right on the left side near midfield in restart will be awarded to St Louis\nOne of the things that has been at a disadvantage with this match up tonight for St Louis with Orange County is ... now and who have elder both about six for six by you lose that advantage they had an air raid some\nReal trees in the backfield or or oh see who will sometimes and that first lemons humor sometimes and her first love and interchangeable players but again I'm thinking both be average players but look like stars Jim winter planes to against one\nBack I'm retaliate and kicks Diego sent me already okay he's not supposed to be doing that we understand that the referee sees the action by that gum and immediately sends back them off and ruins that game and that's in a World Cup now England that they're ...\nThey played superbly the rest of the game ... by Paul ... ah went out with a penalty kicks up at the exact same scenario happened here\nOr one of the referees and the St Louis area her silver who's done a lot of games a nationally and most importantly internationally se ... as well another referee who's done tones of games on the international level\nAt the main one of the main thing is you're always say is that a referee has to have a distinct feel a temperature\nA temperature for the overall game this referee on this particular play as soon as that occurred\nAs soon as that occurred he pulls out a red card\nSo obviously he didn't have a feel for the pressure of the overall attention to the scenario now and less as I mentioned also said something to a either a seat in the process or perhaps the referee but nonetheless say well see I see as of as of the twenty first minute\nIs playing a man down so [noise] ah say she finds itself down by ... to nothing Michael speak with both goals so it's very simple what you have to do\nWhat you have to do when the second half starts a if it'd be at all possible do not allow a third\nTry to get back in the game somehow some way or if that means changing a player here or there perhaps change formation of the Orange County team they are very content right now and you have seen\nYou have seen that on a regular basis now GM they're very comfortable just knocking the ball around either the two central defenders in the backfield or the two men feel as a grunt coming back and I've also has loads of free time but anywhere on the central Carter there's all kinds of free time\nWe use that term parking the bus there will be into buses parks now for Orange County and the second half there'll be content just to sit back\nAnd St Louis and that they feel is will at some point as you pointed out will try and make a substitution and the second half to change feel somehow some way and we will see that play itself out or it is extra time nonetheless a\nLot of things going on in St Louis soccer obviously one this\nA lot of things going on in St Louis soccer obviously one this playoff game first for this franchise and everyone's excited for that and and getting into the play offs\nBut you've got I mentioned the hall of fame week when we've got MLS news in the last ten days here at St Louis so where do you want to go because there's

it when it's over but this group is stuck together all season long and ah deserves a lot of kudos St Louis fc the side for getting to this point tonight\nWell first of all getting into the playoffs jam we talked about it at our last game I think the real stretch from the twenty eighth of July for the fifteenth of August or they won\nFour straight games getting a valuable twelve points at an integral part of the season that really turned their season around\nA and they did so first part of the year\nGood portion of the first part of your playing with out many members of their first eleven\nCountless injuries to key personnel\nNever had the same first eleven\nAlways had to alter it because of injuries but with all that\nBeing said they ended up finishing the season in eighth get into the playoffs forty nine eleven a dramatic\nTurnaround for this team and justice fourth year so the outcome of this irrespective of the outcome of this other played some very good quality soccer the shirt\nOrange County controls the possession we play in the eighty first just about ready to go in the eighties second minute of the match ends or family debt until in Chesterfield valley is proud to sponsor St Louis essay on Katie are us Dr Jeff you answer and his team of created an environment that's comfortable and friendly\nAs we have an opportunity with Darwin Jones coming down the right side behind that effect you know say bye go I'm at the sewers left comes up with a big say\nFalls loose in the box left side Orange County keeps the possession alive in the eighties second made it possible\nSafe but ... is that the New York post Darwin Jones hits it from point blank range well inside the penalty area they go home as somehow stations himself but then you're opposed to make the safe preventing a certain sense\nAlso didn't send it towards school a chance that that penalty died off from Ramos good dog goes over a goal in St Louis gets the goal kick this time\nTold my goal manage just come up with a number of dynamite saves tonight he has worked hard deceiving angle\nVery much so and Brian Jones the goalkeeper was very pleased with this play late in the game late in the season he finally got totally fit\nOne of the players where we're talking about just a moment ago Jimi wasn't capable of playing the first part of the year he likewise recovering from surgery wasn't able to play the first part of the year take pills and\nSlid into first Lebanon and did a magnificent job that federal ... so\nYou have to tell what a goalkeeper is on your team go ... and this particular game saving it from being perhaps five or six\nRight now it is for NATO's going to come off the bench for Orange County as we play in the eighty third minute\nAnd the Mets fear him andme will come off\nFor Orange County is\nThey hold on air will play Reno it will be another home game for Orange County because they ended up first they continue to have that\nHome field advantage\nCincinnati likewise finish in the year twenty three three and eight\nSeventy seven points\nThat is an astonishing run\nBy FCC Cincinnati and with all that being said they narrowly escaped but home today on penalty kicks\nOver the visiting Nashville club\nAll stood has it done this near wing for Orange County as they cross midfield the NATO now off the bench gets his first touching the eighty fourth minute as we play on here\nAnd what looks to be the final match the season for St Louis F. C. as a trail for nothing in the eighty fourth minute\nOnce again if you're just joining us things changed in the twenty first minute as the official gave a red card to Tony wall St Louis has already trailing one nothing at that point\nPlayed down a man for the rest of the match now this change the complex into this match completely\nIn the complex into this match completely\nAnd wouldn't hurt them at that particular time Jim was that early goal by state and after the give away the central part of the field from St Louis fc a truth be told they put themselves in that whole early and were chasing the game on the roads something you don't want to do\nThat because they gave the ball ... against the very talented team Seton himself as the guy who started to play he cut the play out\nMaybe initial tackle ran for the return ball for ... and that's when the game turn right away then at the eleventh minute\nReally really turned the twenty first won ... percent off\nHis team is matched up twice in the regular season both were drawn in ... and uh\nI Know in the first one St Louis came back late early ... what the goal and then they did the same after falling behind here in St Louis at home\nAnd went down to the one but St Louis came away with it all late to them even that one up\nThere that was a first game was out here\nIn Irvine on the may twelfth one to one was the final Hilton scored the eighty second minutes\nAnd the team teams' tired again on July twenty first appeared to silver the loan player\nFrom Orlando he got to try and go into Seventy nights when a cow Greg likewise ... games gives me we're pointing out again that you're missing too valuable players yeah first eleventh hour Greg and wall fall\nFall fall with the growing injury in cow Greg with crack ribs where you had to alter your man yeah no that's trying to even get comfortable a college as I mentioned jogging during the week when the when the team was training\nThat he's still felt uncomfortable\nOr athletic trainer Brian bounds was entertaining\nI emphasize entertaining putting some sort of a vast\nBrought it in a lot of different players and they were successful\nEarly in the ear mid year\nPlaying without a lot of key players so the overall process work throughout the entire season absolutely\nYou know when we think about the back half of the season once we came back from injuries and the character the team showed to get through that period and then the run they went on to uh make the playoffs again super proud of this group of Anthony the entire staff the front office and of course thankful for the great support we have\nYou mentioned that run gym in the terms gives me a we talk about it all the time the games from the twentieth of July the fifteenth of August when they won that four straight getting a valuable twelve points that part of the season really show that this overall process again I continued to reference to that because\nThe team talks about that all the time they had submitted their way in this western conference or at fluctuating between six seven and eight but in this young teams existence it's only four years old\nYou finally get into the playoffs certain obviously not the way you want to conclude season but nonetheless the mere fact that you get into the playoffs so is that progress is being\nMe absolutely and this is something we can build on you know without a\nWithout knowing exactly what Jeremy and Anthony have in store for a player selection and the roster next year you can you can assure yourself that uh there's going to be a good chunk of this team\nIn this roster that will be back and a much higher percentage than I think in years before which are again bill and Jim shows\nProgress react because there are the first three years there were dramatic changes in the off season\nFor sure and that you know in a division to a that's not uncommon but uh but those clubs that have shown that they can select a roster and and bring you know a good chunk of it back or the ones that have continued to build upon a build upon things which is what we're looking at and\nWe spoke at half time of the game last week with Jim Cavanaugh Tom and perhaps you can re emphasized effect that irrespective of what transpired with MLS than the overall effort a U.S cell is not going anywhere it's going to remain a part of the pyramid of soccer here in St Louis absolutely\nSt Louis FCC and in the youth club is planning on being integrated should we be successful with MOS overall and I think that's incredibly important for the city and what we building here\nAre supporters of put their blood sweat tears paychecks into into this club and they live and breathe and even at the end I don't know if you guys could hear it on the broadcast put worth a watch party you know the the banner comes up for zero in\nTough wait and the season and they break out into a chance S T [laughter] it was a it was pretty heart warming and uh so we're very proud of it and yes uh\nWhatever ends up happening with them a lesson we certainly hope for our community inner city in our club that were successful but uh this organization will be part of it\nAnd you need to look for a time than the latter part of the year you referenced letter part of the year of crowds of fifty four hundred and six thousand eight teams for the last game that speaks volumes of what the people in this community want to see that was good quality attractive soccer\nPlayers who are continuing to get better and continuing to put St Louis back in the national soccer mad absolutely\nI think if we build upon what we did the back half of the season and there's names that they recognize and ah continue to come up to support a we're setting up for a very very strong fifth season it couldn't be prouder of the team and uh the over all support of the community\nAnd that's how I appreciate you taking a couple of minutes with us here tonight I see you every night as you walk because you're you're always out what the supporters and supporters were again here tonight out at the soccer park and it only gets better moving forward\nYet we appreciate or the ... and uh you guys and thanks for having me\nAll right our time as two top struck CFO for St Louis fc what this here tonight St Louis falls by a score of four to nothing the supports here\nThe infrastructure here we're short gym on establishing a successful franchise because there's a lot of strides made this year with the personnel and Anthony pills coming in here there's just a different\nFeel ... and just to echo the sentiments of what Tom struck just talked about you could be assured Ah yes perhaps there'll be some changes of a matter of fact of course there will be always stuck\nThere is not going to be I don't think Jim ... a dramatic overhaul of this team or the basic players of solid first eleven twelve Thirteen fourteen Fifteen people are indeed here with this team and perhaps if they stay a bit healthier throughout the entire year\nFor the entire year they don't have to worry so much late this season trying to get back to the the overall spray of the playoffs picture\nSo lost tonight the season comes to an end for St Louis fc Orange County moves on they will play a RINO next week the goal next year you get home playoff game and you just keep moving forward ride\nKeep building you keep building up but again it's a ... a word of the things that Tom talked about what the overall process of what the team was trying to do with the youth development the academy teams the USSL than perhaps perhaps go eat the MLS do it the way they do it all over the world\nA structure a team that is alive and well in your community it continues to sell the idea that yes there is soccer available at the MLS level as well as the U.S cell level and there are players perhaps and hopefully locally who can contribute to both of those teams\nThe village wraps up another season for us our fourth on the big fight my second year calling games with you it's been an honor and privilege and hopefully we'll get to continue this moving forward there's a lot of soccer history in St Louis yet to be made\nThat Jim there's a it starts back in Eighteen Seventy five so let's continue to capitalize it is incumbent upon us\nWho are alive and well doing these games now to continue to try to build\nOn that tradition of traditions but made that's been laid the groundwork stimulate it is now up to this current team these current players these younger players or to change the way the game was played in America it's a sport for a change in America and St Louis should and always has played a\nPart in that will wrap it up for us here tonight from worldwide technology soccer park

obsessed with Bobby knights\nOf course you know who is a legend in his own time in in his own mind ... the guy who loved to throw the or the chairs and yell at all the kids and so he got ... to do sort of a fictionalized version of Bobby Knight\nAnd the movie actually costs are Shaquille O'Neal when he was just about to be drafted by the magic onset was a kid named him pretty hard away Shaq was so impressed with making the movie the he demanded the magic take a look at him all the sudden\nThey're they're the eastern conference championships because of this movie it's called blue chips or you know sure and so it started streaming right now on I Choose any it's ... it's definitely a good film as long as you can stomach the Bobby Knight is a ... of\nOf a Nick multi meaning he's kind of in your face sure there was a movie about Bobby Knight like well any five years ago\nI'm not going to say that I mean he he actually Nick multi a shattered Bobby Knight to kind of get his mannerisms up but it's not a bio pic okay she ended up ... version of him so he's just another coach who get angry here and that the Bush ups definitely worth watching shack\nNever really quit his day job thankfully use broadcaster now he was amazing basketball player not really the best actor so you're gonna have to forgive them here with us or a blue chips that would of course all about basketball\nThen I've got one that has basketball in the title but it's not really about basketball there is a fantastic writer who I adore named Jim Carol and she sort of a counter culture a hit the writer or in the in the late seventies\nAnd um she was just amazingly brilliant he became friends with Patti Smith he started doing some punk rock music couple of great record you had a record them Catholic Boy which is really really good but he also did a whole lot of heroin\nNow here's the thing if you want to be a really successful writer maybe don't do a lot of trucks unfortunately a lot of them do whether it's mccaskey drinking himself to death or what have you and the way I mean for whatever reason creative people tend to uh I I Do that so he wrote a memoir about his younger life called the basketball diaries\nAnd it was so named because he was a really talented basketball player in his Catholic school and of course that went away when he got more and more into heroine\nLeonardo DiCaprio place gym Carol in this movie\nMaybe I've seen at the end it has a really fantastic soundtrack including a flee from a chili peppers it's got Pearl Jam on it and one of the coasts are Mark Wahlberg right after he was mark and mark\nIn the funky bunch and there was a Mark Wahlberg why she had a movie now of course ... box office ... basketball diaries kind of a depressing film obviously with all the heroin however if you've never ... amazing poet and writer\nNetflix absolutely out and you only to capitalize probably about Ninety five or so and I it's before\nIt gets right around the same time as Romeo and Juliet and that same kind of yes so basketball diaries is what that was called it we've got a comedy that when I said the so called people now to go well I guess that is a basketball movie gene off\nI never saw it now there's now I Know yeah I Know that I haven't fought I Know\nNow I Know you love Jason Bateman do she was ... to T o rights which is a horrible horrible terrible well he was like his cousin or something he's like oh I'm also liberal mixes and\nMichael J. Fox was one of his first big starring roles and run around the same time as a ... a great great he becomes aware wolf and instead of hiding it from people writing and murdering people instead of ... and ... and goes out as they were both on the basketball court\nAs one should the audience whole school rallies behind him as a Jess ... as long\nAs you know I don't think that that's that would ever actually work in real life because think about it when I was in high school I had a lot of our pet hair out of me in gym all the time he had like an entire face covering hair everybody's cheering for\nThis shift and she will not a true story from an atheist comedy classic which guys and I've seen\nTo a comedy failure a giant flop at the box office ... yes\nDoes routinely dismissed on line people who love Talladega Nights or or the other sports movies you learned a lot of sports I did like it though I Love this movie it's called semi pro guy on Woody Harrelson than it was fantastic if you Andre three thousand from outcast\nAnd this guy um uh what Will Ferrell as sort of a she is a he has to be cooked a co owner of a BA team called the Pelican Bay 'cause I just felt like an hour and a and it's just I Love the show mother was extremely funny and I was having a ball watching it and give it a really positive review\nOn my movies show and then I just turned on the vine nobody ever talks about it and that was driven I think on Amazon right now it's called semi pro if you like Will Ferrell give it yeah it is very funny\nAnd then of course you were talking about earlier guy who's yours yack\nThem arguably the greatest basketball film of all time it's got an amazing speech at the end of course which is what you want in the sports movie like this and that really is no better character actor the Gene Hackman into watching him a lot of these young men to victory is just an amazing amazing story or as we hit the brake here because Madison and we have to go to traffic which is fine\nI wanted to give a special dishonorable mentioned\nTo a movie that a lot of young people seem to hold in high regard and this is a film I I'm forty okay guy so I was a bit too old when this film came out I never saw it\nAnd um I kept seeing younger people people in their late teens early twenties stable just things that a work of art this thing is a legend this thing is amazing I Can't believe this and I finally washed up the other day to strip it\nThere as\nWell or you can fight colds with 'em using ... and also you should get the universe a streaming service talking and talking to do for self Mick Achilles thank you so much for coming on the show today for\nThe future but I\n\nMean\nBe done to\nMe when\nI got home and you know\nThe\nThree one four six four or five two thousand\nTired of hearing it did they they're that they're the experts blah blah blah during one unsubstantiated claim after another\nYear or two substantiated claiming that actually means something if you need to prepare for a new roof with a family owned business traditional over eighty years at eighty thousand satisfied customers and you can depend on credit grouping residential or commercial\nNow how\nDid we find more\nFlooring takes more abuse doesn't any product you'll ever bought into your home\nTo withstand that wear and tear requires a solid product and a superb installation you get both from the contractor members of the flooring industry council\nTheir crews install floor layers have four years of classroom and hands on training and are required to take refresher glasses throughout their careers are great installation won't fix a cheap products and inexpensive flooring does not perform well went installed improperly\nFor the best selection of flooring products and an installation from the most highly trained craftsmen for a floor you'll be proud of for years to come all the flooring industry council\nThat three one for the night six eight three five to to\nEr visits F.

at ... dot com on the IMAX movie page and you can follow me on Twitter at max movies I'm here to talk about the new horror film Halloween not the one from Nineteen Seventy eight\nNot the one from two thousand seven to one to twenty Eighteen and this is the third motion picture called Halloween\nHowever it's actually a Halloween too but there are two other movies called Halloween too and yes this is confusing and sort of helped me out I got my pal marches jokes you know him as the producer of all access with Jay cans or hello mark is how you doing today max well and doing All right you and I had a date earlier this week we went to go see\nHalloween because you were on my case about this for about six months max you have to take me to this movie\nBS I was I'm a big Alexander up watching it as a child and I was very excited for them to do a sequel not a remake to the original one and yeah I Want to talk about with you on your show today\nSo you and I are sort of the um exception to the rule most people have seen Halloween hundreds of new John Carpenter classic one of the best slugger pictures of all time there I think I voted in three different format to love that film at western million times\nHowever very few people have ruined the gauntlet of watching every single Halloween spinoff remake side pool sequel\nAnd you and I have ... we shared an office and we realized that when we're talking about all the different sequels and prequels in cycles that we've seen all of them and even the bad ones I think we've enjoyed a little bit\nJust a little bit I mean I like the Halloween five revenge up Michael Meyers you seem not to like it I kind of agree with used one of the worst it means to an even worse than them out there doesn't explain a lot a you're a big age too old fan I Am Jamie Lee Curtis is she's back in this movie yeah and I think it helps this franchise out a lot\nCan we agreed that the best Halloween films as a rule involved Jamie Lee Curtis\nAbsolutely because you have for them you know hairs and the general Harrison four or five and she wanted to come back with six but they re castor for that was probably for the best\nSixers are one of the worst ones but of course she was also in Rob zombies Halloween Halloween to try to do that you told me that I really like wow that she wasn't so she's been in for as well their dinner Harris has been in for Halloween films as Jimmy lord\nAs humanly Curtis is worry strode has been in for services in Halloween\nHalloween to back in the seventies eighties and then of course ... and H for which is really what they should have called this one which is called however it\nGet downstairs [noise]\n[noise]\nExplain to people the concept that uh the Danny McBride use a screen writer here I Am very surprised she wrote that he's a comedy guided this is the end you're hiding us a lot of really funny films but he loves the Halloween franchise like like you and I have many teamed up with his good friend David Gordon Green threat who directed pineapple express which he was also in\nAnd out to do this new version Halloween to explain the people have this is different than the other films\nOr this one is different because this one is a pretty much a sequel to the very first one so you can cut out Halloween to back in Nineteen eighty one I Believe all of them\nAnd that is a very major distinction because yes what happened in Halloween to\nUh and that one they were revealed that they are brothers those are generally Curtis Laurie Strode and Michael Mars or brother and sister and this one they scratch that when\nThey are not relate as the first time that that's been scratched up because every other timeline and yes it's very confusing but the foreign timeline or would they know Harris still had a family\nConnection for Rob zombies to remake made the family connections huge runners and of course even ... still her brother so this is the very first time since the early eighties and\nThat they have not been related to me it's a head scratcher\nMichael my scene and being killed his sister when he was six years old and he came out to eat just tell you why you want to get him inside his mind\nMichael Meyers murdered five ... he's a human being we need to understand transferring\nAnd happy not to ... to the end and the idea and it was so and\nI think he might speak with you\nThis second one is to say it's a it's a very it's a head scratcher like you said it really is because it's one of those movies where there's nine previous Halloween films\nBut I I don't understand the motivation of erasing the family bought\nAnd try to cover is involved in this movie for the first time since that second film back in the early eighties or use executive producer here you also does the film score he also to the store for that first and second how in film\nAnd my favorite aspect of this movie is that score is really wonderful I'm a it's a ominous moody and are really helps the movie when when the movie isn't great the music always is and\nI I like the re mastered of all the original score this because it picks up a little baby or another ... it's very slow very frightening but this one actually picked up a little bit some drums behind it picks up and because if you if you watch the movie Michael Meyers\nIs not as slow as we know that he's very fast paced this time around and he's really out to kill a lot of people in they even said back in Seventy eight you only killed five people in ... he\nHe pretty much doubled that troubled that'll mosaic\nSo I'm just trying to think I was thinking of it might be ... right around that same number I was thinking five or six I think so you get a lot I'd have to really think about it until about five people in that first first time you've got to you and I were talking about how this movie would be received a very differently and I think I think it will do well as the box office but it would be received very differently\nHow do we not had any sequels effort if this was a very first movie after forty years to involve Michael Meyers\nPhillies cheering in the aisles and a true enough at the screening that we saw at the Esquire people wearing Michael Meyers shirts nobody would even get in some people who are the line around the block so the anticipation for this is awfully high and I think some younger audience members\nMight not realize the Jamie Lee Curtis came back Twenty years ago for age to odor and there are so excited to see her back now\nHow is she in this film\nBut she's phenomenal she's a great actor and she's great once again as a slightly different more unhinged Laurie strokes\nWhat's terrifying that he meant that there is no rhyme or reason that really it is nothing he is nothing in in that ... that ...\nIs being bought him into pure evil and that's why it's so terrifying\nYou have the younger generation on Tuesday and it also pays tribute to the older generation because you have the granddaughter and she's and only in high school and they had to like get together party over at the high school and a kind of pay tribute to resurrection a little bit I don't know if you noticed
