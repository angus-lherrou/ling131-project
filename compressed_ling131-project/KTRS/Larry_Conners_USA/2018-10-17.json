next year I'm not going to happen\nNow let's go blues and let's go ... but let me just give it and then because we don't talk sports a great deal here but I Will add my two cents which is\nIf I Am build the wet I'm nervous as all get out a about trying to get to land Bryce Harper and spending that kind of money that man runs through walls he does things he's injured a fair bit\nAnd you're going to have to pay him all the tea in China um to get him to come here and I don't blame him for asking for it I don't blame him for getting for getting it\nUm but it's quite a risk and it's probably above the the the a risk aversion level of the St Louis cardinals so there you go there it is hurting you done it's done over\nThe big sports show pull off overtime is is done\nWith Jake cans tonight we have artistic director of the repertory theater Steve Wolfe is with us Raphael Esparza we are going to talk sports tonight uh all kinds of things we'll talk about a book making on the world series were the favorites fully NBC a season as beginning but\nWe're also going to talk about what are the odds of on the royal baby\nBeing a girl hardly even in a way\nA dairy they have already started Raphael is already posted those odds are but those odds are crazier to teach them the [laughter] boy girl fifty fifty or you know and that's the perfect ... for a book maker because they take ten percent try to understand on one side of the book maker always wins yeah\nSo uh uh ... will be with us as well\nI'm now in the\nStudio here world headquarters\nAre a ... and let me but I Apologize smart is it ... it is ... thank you I just want to make sure because you have an election coming up in the last thing a politician needs is the guy\nPronouncing your name wrong still live at Republican Mark my teeth and he is um a state rep from the kind of been near north county area a little northwest counties that were correct\nThat's right we go from Chesterfield all the way round outside to Seventy two hazel wouldn't\nOkay so that a little bit more with the northwest actually\nAlso mark harder Republican county council member and you are more west the northwest because you had all the way out there to the to the county line am all the way up to the crickets and\nSo they are both in here tonight as a we have a mark harder in here quite a bit every other Tuesday and he's brought mark with men tonight we want to talk about a number of issues local issues but one of them\nIs Westlake landfill\nAnd we have had lots of folks on the show we hear about it all the time and frankly I think unless you're living up there and living day to day it starts getting very confusing\nBut we should be more aware of what's going on this isn't a um an issue just for those folks to live right next to the landfill we all live in this area this is an area issue when my kids were playing um baseball over a bridge didn't it was an issue for them\nThat is right over there at the airport the whole St Louis county area\nThat's all right Jay this is really something that affects our entire region\nOr the wind is going to blow every direction right and there's a lot in the air that screen coming off that site over the years and it's all of our jobs to pay attention to what's going on that site but Jay I'm here actually with some good news alright\nI sat down with the EPA big group of is back in the last week of September ... as they announced their final resolution to clean up the landfill or at least get Seventy percent of the radioactive material out\nA earlier they put out a plan that just dug up the top sixteen feet of soil we've always known the most potent radioactive material on that side is sitting on top\nSo the EPA went through and\nFigured out where the most radioactive material is that at the ... and ... ... per gram level to ... the cars dirty polluted stuff that could affect people's health and racket\n[noise] [laughter]\nUm so they're committed ... they're committed to getting that material\nOut let me stop you just for a second marks for people like me to Jay only have a ... thirty six thousand foot knowledge we heard there's radioactivity or radioactive material up there and tell us what it is and how it got there just briefly\nI back in Nineteen Seventy three a Barry unscrupulous company makes radioactive material at topsoil and shipped it off to the landfill is clean filtered\nWow and that's how it ... this isn't the or the old the Nineteen forties we're building the bomb that\nIt is in the ah the old the Nineteen forties we're building the bomb that\nSpread exactly Manhattan Project legacy waste the same material but leaked in cold water creek and poison thousands of people up in\nThat area so it is the same material and they kind of looked at mixed it in and put it in the great that the ice\nAbsolutely I Would love to go back in time and find it a person responsible for that from the ... corporation die so we know that\nIt that it's there the testing and given 'em so is it mostly on the top in the top soil or hit ... down in\nThe top twenty feet and so there's areas are only going to dig down eight feet there's areas are going to dig down a full twenty feet\nWell for this site for this project we have the money okay so it's as you know I have been\nAnd at the ... got to spend years trying to get their money back from the responsible parties afterwards they'll do it at that time but they had the money for this product that's good as far as the administration just chop and the whole department of the EPA that's never been there a plan what they their goal for our EPA is to restore it to its original purpose\nGet these contaminated sites cleaned up that's why the ph their prevention of polluted air and\nCleaning up our sites [noise]\nLet me ask you this then um\nDo you think that the administration at this point has been too tough on the EPA we were here oh a lot of red tape we don't need these agencies the three letter agencies when in this particular case for you when the sun and because of your hard work and wanting to get it done\nYou know hopefully lives are going to be saved you know it's always yeah for everyone else it's a waste of money but for me right here do this was money well spent\nHighly kind of balance that the\n... what we need is just simply focus now you can never be too tough on the EPA can never be too tough on these agencies to to make sure that they're actually spending the money that they're given for the purpose that the money given to\nLocate outcomes are um you know kind of cost and benefit had been a an a cost benefit analysis has been performed but we're not just doing things for the sake of\nDoing absolutely you know one of the big concerns that I have I've got a framework it up the Hanford a musician side in Washington he's been there for years they're spending a lot of money up there nothing has been cleaned up yet\nSo you want to find ways to earn money I get out the federal government myself that it really is all there is a lot of busy work going\nAll right I put you on the spot there are I think the good news you have brought it is that uh for this area if things are going to happen now my last question then we're gonna move on to maybe some county issues uh with mark Carter\nWhat do we do again getting back to these people what can be done for these folks in terms of a ... you know what's already happened to them is their money I sugar I'm certain there are good lawyers out their Jake the fat man they're probably already rounding up a a you know clients but at the end of the day\nYou know one of the things government can do is we have access to the government to medical um you know kind of technology we have access to a assets and resources to help people that have been exposed is there anything that's been talked about along those lines\nAnd that is where my role is going to be coming in this next session because we're not talking about how we can get these people for a move from that situation because honestly even even if the risk has been lessened there still risk\nWhen we ... we put in a big I'm a runway shirt removed half a bridge in a way\n... ... ... over noise yeah I'm getting about the trolley a better you\nKnow like when is it yeah Dale you and everyone else but my point is yeah if we wanted an airport runway will move the whole town chair or if we want an end Ga will buy up three hundred houses these people have been sitting next to you've been sitting next to us the radioactive waste dump and now what are you going to do for\nWell first I'm gonna ask everybody who's listening who lives in that area who's been affected by the with their health on this situation show up a week from tonight at\nFive o'clock at the hearts of St Charles banquet center where the department of health and senior services are going to go through this one hundred and ten page document to just torturing\nFurther and if there are still alive right they'll get help by say ...\nThat people showing up one week from tonight to express directly to the people looking at these numbers how this has really affected their health\nRight it's not just a hundred and ten page document absolutely real people and that's where I marked with decent ... thank you for it\nWell that's right ... thank you for your work on this issue is so important it's been going on for so long\nUm gosh I remember when the thing first started on fire and we just kind of said sure and then ... ... as around the fence and while I'm good news [noise] All right mark Carter\nSt Louis county councilman\nA move what good news do you bring to the show to see you know it's always\nGood news [laughter] vacation pictures to go through that I'm no good news or the government still functioning\nAh we ah the government uh the console one hour lawsuit in court and uh uh the county executive cannot hold back our budget for the legislative branch of our government\nAnd for the first time the legislative branch of saying it was kind of government has been recognized as such and not just as a down their department of St Louis county government so that's a groundbreaking case uh through a judge in through a court case that we have so uh that that will set the tone for\nFuture budgets and so on right now come November first we will get our first peak at a executive stanger budget\nGoing forward for Nineteen Ninety or for for twenty Nineteen and we want to make sure that we're gonna start having hearings department by department hearings to make sure that that budget reflects the will of the of the council and the people in St Louis county\nWhere ... we've seen a lot of people leaving county government and top positions didn't the department of health the head of the department of health leave we\nHave a lot of a department heads that are being ... of those positions being filled by a deputies ... and uh we've got a number of people leave a starting from the department of health the department of public works and transportation I'm a number of ministry to post a so\nIt's there are a lot of it as the economy you know they uh some other jurisdictions may pay more than St Louis county we've never been on the top list of high highest paid jobs I editing level and um but we've been a steady employer and we have a pension for many people so\nUh in bad times everybody flocked to the government and good times or watch it ... back there you know so that's kind of the transition we're in right now tonight we heard\nA lot of ah employees of the county are asking for a pay raise a we haven't done a general pay raises for probably three to five years depending on the position\nAnd because of property which is the money for the police and for a ... safety uh those workers got races and uh the people that are not associated with the police are not associated with the courts are not associated with\nUh the jail [laughter] they didn't get a race and haven't gotten a raise in many years so\nUh those folks are starting to come to our meetings on Tuesday nights to say hey we want a raise and make sure you put it in the budget so what do you think about that as a kind of counseling it's one of my goals because we've been listening to us or for the last four years that I've been on the console\nAnd I'm a but we also have to look at everything else uh right now we're probably because the economy is so a heated up\nUh we're probably at the maximum amount of revenue that's going to be coming into the county this year maybe next year\nIf the economy takes a downturn our revenue goes down right has a sales tax and we're so dependent on sales tax and property tax so as long as everything's rosy out there that money keeps coming in and keeps coming in at a higher rate 'em but once things turned than we all got to start tightening up or boats\nWe we I think this time around we are going to really force them to the discussion\nAnd the conversation dealing with what is the role of St Louis county government\nUm we can't be everything to everybody Andrew in state government can't be that way county government federal government so the discussion has to be okay what is it either the private sector can pick up\nA ... can pick up or things that we just don't need to be doing any more um and we got to look at that because everything we look at it\nFor a\nGetting involved in involves salaries involve people in assets and a lot of money spent so we I think it is interesting I mean by what we want to do\nIs sure you look at different municipalities in what they do and we just assume that everybody does the same thing but a few months back the big discussion in the city of St Louis was trash trash trash we are a lot of our trucks are wording we after after all over the place\nYou look at a lot of other municipalities around the area they don't provide trash pickup that's a decision if that if you watch trashed picked up at your house we will contract with one or more folks to make sure that there's someone there but you're going to pay for that\nI think it's a decision you're right that if people have to decide what is it that cat a government you I mean they should obviously fix roads because they are county roads and they got to keep the police force going and\nI'm a few other things but then you say and then what at what point do we want everyone else to kind of do that because you might do it\nThis is a this is a big deal for you it's another place key most chop house and it'll be good yeah\nI'm waiting it we may get a chance to talk with Bob zany here we were a\nA kind of ran a little long with the uh the folks from St Louis county mark my teeth and and mark Carter thank you to them although as they were leaving they she barks at you know I saw your buddy what's that what's your buddy's name the bald head guy you know the comedian guy that uh\nAnd and he goes you know any I'd forgotten it Bob ... has been the informant\nWith Matt Damon a he has a uh he plays a lawyer by that day it weighs a lawyer in the movie the informant Bob zany who gives us the Zaidi report every Tuesday a hopefully we'll hear from him today coming up in the ten o'clock hour\nArtistic director of the repertory theater Steve Wolfe will join us and then after that Raphael Esparza will tell you what are the odds on the royal baby being a boy girl twins\nAre I'm sure there's some names you name it if there's a whole if there is a bet to be had there taking\nBook on it or want to know because there's a conversation I had someone I didn't know that um maybe it's taking bets on soccer's a circus doesn't [laughter]\nYeah that would that it wouldn't surprise me one bit although I'm I I don't know I guess if you can bet it you know the book I mean Megan she is American and we do know circumcised over here well I I don't know that I don't know whether they do or they don't over there I don't do it over there and she\n... who told you this [noise] ... yeah well you know it was world wide receiver ... way too much time in the men's room it over there they Rick said hey ah jacked up something to that good that's great\nUm eh yeah yeah she went and saw a movie tonight probably can't talk about it but you've got to talk about everybody\nThere besides Lynn she might have been like\nYeah I'm a court case was on assignment or watching a movie so that he can report back as part of max and movies can do to Portland to Thursday for me to\nYeah to me there ... I don't want to you know you probably have a contract with max and movies that prevents you from disclosing anything but actually do\nActually do what would you say if you need a movie review on Thursday night I got you there was three hundred people there to\nGuide [noise] what can you say what movie it was the Halloween [noise] which is I'm not a remake is it is it just goes to the very first one a sequel you know that makes it Halloween to than\nTo say to read to hotels like it's part of our way but the sequel was noted that no it's not if it's a sequel it's Halloween to\n... or for the other big all there are rules to all of this ... oh no but it was a who's the star a Jamie Lee Curtis okay and she was in the original yes they have the original Mark I'm ours back I forgot his name like make something\nMhm he's back but but he's a map gives me he had the ... the original market Mars person back in Seventy eight where the guy who played them that's the about the last time I saw that movie when it first came out and I said I got a speeding ticket on the way home from that movie\nWell guess what do you go see this one because it shows up right after that when I get I get a speed\nBut said it says I wouldn't know where to begin or end it since it's been since Nineteen Seventy eight\nOr a good thing then this dodging the movie would definitely help you with that so you probably remember there's a lot of cops their primary you got a speeding ticket to know if you're already been a\nLot of cops in New Hampshire I was coming home on a back road and I lost my license because I had just got my licence Seventy eight I was a Seventeen just going to get my driver's license and they hadn't had it long enough so when I got the ticket I lost my license for two weeks that
