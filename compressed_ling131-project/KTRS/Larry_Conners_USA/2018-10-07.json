to maximize your movie going experience [noise]\nMax Boise a ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] yeah movies are terrible movie or something\nTo undo me was that was among the the film critic in many ways you go with her to go\nI\n\nLet's talk about our be G. or there will be a narrative version of a fictional version of Ruth Bader Ginsburg life story which has been a long time in the works Natalie Portman was attached to portray within which I can totally see yes I especially in this documentary RPG you see pictures\nOf her when she was much younger and I think there's definitely that resemble into the Portland is step back and she will not produced the film\nAnd there's actually a star wars connection because of course there is Felicity Jones who played ... or so in rogue one will play Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAn upcoming film which you should be released next year it's called on the basis of sex and I believe this is based on one of her first major cases which we can talk about too because it was sort of an ingenious thing she did to kind of wake a lot of men up about gender inequality and of course\nYou can only do that if you make the case about men and women and that's what she did but this documentary is just called R B gee it's not called the notorious RPG but they do talk about that and they do talk about how uh how how she knows who she's been sort of Nick named after the notorious the gene how she's comfortable with that\nYou and I and John grace and had her personal trainer on our show\nThat's when she started came back on my radar because she is eighty four eighty five now and we had a personal trainer on ... and her workout are amazing and she's a two time cancer survivor ...\nWhich is why she wears the Madonna gloves ... or at least the gloves on her hands and it looks great it's a really cool fashion statement but it's actually to cut down on drums because she's a two time cancer survivor although they're fishing at times I Would think they would be probably more just for fashion show\nBut yes um she's in her eighties she does a million push ups a day and we did have her\nHer personal trainer on and it's funny it's like a house price she is now and how in control she is because\nBack when she was in her sixties and she was nominated for the high court by Bill Clinton there were a lot of people who thought she was too old met her sixties to hold it but I Wonder if it really was ages him or if it was also because she was a woman I don't know if a six year old man would have\nThat nobody would ever quite often that right you are but at the documentary so interesting about her personal life she lost her husband some years ago about what a love story they had and wish they'd or Ginsburg his client introverted Syria\nYou had and Ruth Bader Ginsburg this quiet introverted serious workaholic and he was the opposite\nView as loud and gregarious and the life of the party and it was really great to watch a video of those to you on TALK shows together and stuff because you could tell they were very much in love he passed away back in in two thousand ten\nUm but it talks about her early days and wanting to become a you know a lawyer and I'm In the Nineteen fifties I'm going to law school at Harvard at Harvard and her parents were only I'm encouraging to her because she had met this man and said well when all of this doesn't work out at least you have a husband\nAnd what was it an incredible about her her graduating class were five hundred people in this graduating class she was only one of of nine women who graduated so I became fascinated by the idea of these other eight women\nSo I thought I'm going to have to go see the threat of terror movie that I talked to another friend of mine who is a film critic who went to see the the uh it was it was you I'm Sorry John ... a great and it was on a friend\nAt all there was you went to the solos murders and we always right and you went to the solo star wars story played this trailer yes they did\nI don't know if they should play the trailer before a star wars movie 'cause there's kids in the audience likes right and it was a pretty ... pretty messed up trailer right it was indeed well it's not as bad as what happened in Australia or on their version of Memorial Day which is on January thirtieth um the trailer for hereditary played before Peter wrapped\nObviously hair on the lake by whatever sixteen year old was working at the Australian just said early somebody at the wrong\nButton I but you know either that was the wrong button or it was a great a publicity for this movie 'cause it's one of the first three ways but people heard about it too so uh this movie stars Gabriel Byrne's endowed who is a great great actress and Tony collect\nTony ... was in the United states of Tara she's been in all kinds of movies about how young these fantastic individuals wedding ... wedding your terrible Muriel by but if she doesn't do a lot of these kinds of movies and so it was interesting to see her in this role\nOr the movie is about an older woman who uh it passes way she's been estranged from the rest of our family but in her last couple of months of life she goes to live with Tony Clinton Gabriel Byrne's and their two young children well when you when she passes away\nOr they noticed at the funeral that there's a lot of people there that they don't know uh who have shown up for the funeral and these people are sort of similar to the kind of people who kept tabs on Damien\nOh wash them and all of a sudden there's just random people walk like taking a big interest and so there are these people they're with their shaved heads and hearings going yeah your your mom was really great and they're like oh it looks like a whole ... percent and much like on another film that I'll name check Rosemary's Baby there are people who take an interest in what's going to happen to 'em to this family now\nAnd a Tony Collette plays a woman who um is a by trade a a miniature rest she makes miniature houses and a dire ... and ... which is very cool to see on the big screen and that sort of figures into her last of her grip on reality\nUm she starts I'm worrying that her house as hot as you start worrying that her children are in danger from these people who have taken an interest in her mother she find some things in her mom's belongings that are notes on spiritualism them in the coal to answer the new kind of go down again and very Rosemary's Baby\nOr The Exorcist and even a pet cemetery a type of things to where\nI'm at when one of the loved ones or passes away how far would you go to try to bring this last one back well wow that does see McCain\nHas done as well Tony ... is extraordinary in this movie there I don't think there's any chance of this happening because it's a horror film in the academy normally doesn't care about that\nBut uh there's a couple of people already saying this is the first best actress nomination will have in a twenty Eighteen I liken this though to France has been doormen in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri which was not a film that I enjoyed it but I thought she was phenomenal in it and I'm very happy that she won best actress\nI feel the same way about hereditary unfortunately\nThis is a movie not as good as but some of its parts it's absolutely not frightening it is a little shocking as far as some of the imagery it's definitely rated R. you're going to see severed heads you're going damn Yankees aptly lots of things that I'm not going to mention here okay very graphic and definitely they use that for for shock value but for me ... he's not necessarily scary\nIt can make you squirming in your seat and say maybe I'm not going to have a handful popcorn right now but it doesn't necessarily get you know get into the the more ah emotional terrorism that does some of the best\nOf horror movies or did you get into another thing is this is the first released by district or area after he wrote and directed this movie it's a feature film debut and she definitely has a thing for said he camped and he must love Stanley Kubrick because\nAir this movie two and a half hours it could have been Ninety seven\nMinutes if I'm going to show John grace and I'm going to panic hair around you slow with Dr\nMusic coming in and there's John ... and and now we have to show for blooms let's move the camera really slow in the music's ratcheting up and they're sort of or blow up\nAnd do this for the entire two and a half hour anytime it gets pretty tedious it comes off as quite pretentious and it almost becomes a parody of itself instead of really grabbing the audience by the throat it becomes a slog to get through so\nI Wish he would have had an editor on this to make the movie ... a a a more faster clip\nI was reminded of a whole lot of great horror films and great horror writings\nTo clip I was reminded of a whole lot of great\nHorror films and great horror writings\nGoing into this I mean there's elements of H. B. love crafted Stephen King and and the movies that I mentioned earlier and that's fine to take elements of really great work but you have to be able to\nPut it in a blender and make something new and make something better and this one doesn't do that it's going to remind you of better things and then you'll start wishing you were watching this better things instead of watching this one so while I Do think the cash is really good especially Tony collect\nUm story a high builds to a conclusion that is more laughable and scary and again it's just far too long and far too serious and I was\nQuite let down by this movie after I had to build it up in my head and I really thought it was it'd be very scary so I I Can't recommend hereditary\nToo bad I Wonder if somebody's going to do a super kind of just what I Would love to see that happen when you get rid of all the extraneous ... and you know hopefully ... guys first movie he's just a really\nGreat scenes is an accident that causes of death about midway through and I want to say anything more than that but it's a wonderful put together seeing he's obviously talented person and he's drawing from great inspiration but um but all of those ... are just better ... than his movie about being\n[noise]\nTightening the many things as today I Know my mom would be very touch and go to the\nMother a very secretive on that [noise]\nNow you're paying for it right you want to hear a little baby and let me see if she needed [noise]\nShe was very difficult woman at the brains recognize you from your mother\nSometimes where I can feel they're\nOn private rich\nBut when you die [laughter]\nShe wasn't altogether [noise]\nThank you so much for shooting and make sure you follow me on Twitter ... and movies and stay tuned to the big five fifty ...\n...\nOnly ... there were no\n[noise] oh\nHi it's David sure what the inside out showing president of ... station road just south of Manchester planting season is here now we are fully stocked with the area's largest selection of evergreen Japanese maples and shade tree\nShe was from ...

on movies and here we have one of the most anticipated films of the year\nBecause of a wonderful trailer I Know they give out the golden trailer awards every year and honestly the trailer for a star is born\nDirected by Bradley Cooper is one of the best recent trailers I've seen a it's a wonderful little mini movie with wonderful songs and an ending to the trailer does that does not give away the ending of the film\nI think it's really great sort of a little mini work of art but we're not here to talk about the trailer we're here to talk about the actual feature film\nBy Bradley Cooper called stars born is the fourth time the film has been remade there's actually a fifth version out there as well with a different title very similar story structure but let's talk about this one which stars Lady Gaga here I Am discussing it with John Grayson\n... on the inside right here on the big five fifty ... oh\nFor me it smacks Boise I Can't wait to hear about this little kid and [noise] yes\nWe were very special movie to review today and I say special because one of those rare times when I'm able to talk about a movie\nA long is it in advance of its release a this uh this is not released in St Louis until next friday week from today but the studio when they screen to force earlier this week no one will be alive Ben ... first of all they screened it early which is interesting the last movie I saw\nA ... early like this was la la land which of course went on to win best picture and then lose best picture thirty seconds later on it but that's because she was very confident with a star is born and that's what I'm here to talk about so even though it's not out today it next friday I'm not under any kind of embargo so I thought why not review it today this was a very familiar title\nIt is this is the fourth time to just film has been made in Nineteen thirty seven you had freedom march Andrew and again or a she was nominated for best actress for her performance in that film and it was sort of a a a vaudeville backdrop\nUh and then in Nineteen fifty for George ... with Judy Garland and James Mason which is more of a Broadway show tunes type of out of version and then in Nineteen Seventy six you and Chris christopherson and Barbara Streisand which was more of a a you know popular music type of a backdrop\nAn analogy doesn't Eighteen and you've got Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\nI'm and I'm you know I mentioned ... for best actress or Judy Garland was also nominated for best actress for the same part and Barbara Streisand was also nominated for best actress the St parts of guy guy is not is not because she will be the only person not nominated\nFor playing this seem real this is the longest based in time we actually we've had between remakes of this movie seems almost every generation gets their own\nVersion of a star is born and uh what I Love about this movie there's many things I Love the movie I'll tell you right away it's very good and the reason why people should see it next friday and Saturday and Sunday is because this ... this is really the first movie of the year that will be bought ... second movie of the year there'll be a defining cultural moment\nAnd I mean that because you had crazy Rich Asians and that that was a movie bigger than its own bridges because it was about a ... inclusion a lot of different things stars born\nIs not is not going to be in the in the same cultural consciousness for the same reason\nThis is a water cooler movie this is like an episode of this is this is something where everybody's they did you see stars born\nIt's going to be that kind of movie when people go to work did you see Bradley Cooper did you see how great those songs work do you have the shallow on your iPod they have released this song which is all over the trailer called the shallow it was actually co written by ... and ... who's a grew wonderful\nA record producer and writer who works with ... or ... Bruno Mars whole bunch of other people during during about two male injecting careers and actually and I this this song is played in the film a whole bunch and displayed over the un credits and there's no universe there's no timeline there's no ocean\nAnd just played over the un credits and there's no\nUniverse there's no timeline there's no ultimate reality where this song does not win\nThe Oscar for best song from a motion picture\nBy plus I'm sure it's right now at the top of the June sharp I haven't checked but it was just released today\nAnd I'm sure it's rocket is number one it's a really great science called the shallow it's called a shallow and it's such a great song and of course was co written by guy got when she tours she will be performing this as a non ... that kind of a sudden our okay we're ... we're going to add it to her stature right after she just bad romantic and poker face she's going to do this\nBecause I hate the Roche I'm Sorry well this is much much better okay good All right good\nTo know if you're if you're familiar with the story I all four of these films have the same structure although different things happen and that's what makes all four of them worth watching besides the\nPerformances from all the ... and all the ... are great in all of these films is nice to see that the U.S seem a story of being reinterpreted for a modern day audience I mentioned all the different sort of a genre that this film has a\nAs a kid or two over the years this one is the kind of the first time that they married by two different musical genres because a Bradley Cooper sort of a Chris Stapleton\nType of Nathaniel ... uh you know almost Allman brothers influenced Americana artists not quite country not quite rock and roll plays legit a guitar but as a down home kind of guy or his a tour manager\nAnd his older brother are played by Sam Elliott\nWho just brings dramatize to me that he does so that's perfect casting their eye and then God guy starts off as a lounge singer\nWho um has an incredible voice and falls in love with Bradley Cooper\nBut then of course because what happens a producer comes along and says you should be a pop artist as she almost becomes I Would say it's closer to a Katy Perry type thing is I shouldn't be become Lady Gaga because she's very artsy and weird in her in her pop art\nYou know telephones of weird soccer so they don't do that they kind of make her more into a cash show or a I got Katy Perry which of course Bradley Cooper being the the arch east\nYou know have some reservations\nAbout this um a couple of years ago what do you mean if I'm called the blue Jasmine which one Cape lunch at the best actress Oscar and I'm a enter dice clay of all people had a part in that and he was very very good he placed Lady Gaga is father here and you sort of your stereotypical Italian dad but he's also a very very good\nUm this movie was co written directed produced and stars Bradley Cooper this is definitely a vanity projects for Bradley Cooper I'm not a bad thing but he's definitely like look me I'm Bradley Cooper are not getting ready to king\nHe can sing and I was watching the courage to make sure it was actually singing and he's got a pretty decent voice I mean it's I don't know if it I\nAll Israelis shipping\n\nParadise\nABC News on the return President Trump celebrating his political victory for

me\nThere probably checked out because they're listening to the Adam ... show on pod cast on their commute and they're concentrating on your show instead of driving that's that's my take on there now you were pod casting way before people even knew about casting was you turned it into a multimillion dollar enterprise\nDo you think there's a similar platform with these free streaming service like Pluto do you think one day Pluto will become as ubiquitous as a podcast\nWell I Hope so the new world order is you get to watch what you want to watch when you want to watch it you know what I was a kid the Grinch stole Christmas would come on once a year it'd be the middle of December B a B C\nAnd if you're in the bathroom during a commercial break when it came back oh you had to run back and remember\nRunning room on the TV show magical running into a room\nNow try it you just hit pause right\nYeah we are we are spoiled we are spoiled Adam random question what's worse job you've never had\nA I Would say it was really bad job because I did a lot like restaurants in the middle of the night and that was a horrible job and you're an earthquake rehab and construction an ally what's really bad to worse\nAnd building crawling under them and supporting what cats\nWherever that was bad\nFrom dead cats chassis TV which is available on Pluto if people are familiar with ... it's a wonderful lap I've had it on my route to for a couple of years now they've got mystery science theater they've got the cat channel\nOr they're not ... and now they've got chassis which is all about it I I guess you would say it's by your heads for your heads and it's about from you Mr ...\nAt it and um have you been to St Louis\nYes I have multiple multiple times done shows the patch and\nSure sure yeah so what's your favorite part about our city\nOr if you want more of a love story of an action film there's a movie that again it doesn't really have a lot to do with hockey except devious weaning plays an act hockey player who uh through a variety of reasons uh is kicked off from his team in order to get back into good Rick uh good graces has to coach a young ice skater young figure skater\nAnd of course you know he's like I'm not a figure skater I'm a I'm a big rough and tumble hardware and yet we're what happens they fall in love oh mount on Hillary and this is called the cutting edge\nTo come out just in the last decade no ma'am okay and I have no idea let's sound will grant sequel to the ... she came out\nIn the last decade and I forget who was in that but the between ... and more Kelly despite that Nineteen Ninety One Ninety two he used to play on on you know ... vocal cable all the time I used to watch it all the time it's ridiculous but also kind of fun you ever to Europe Oh absolutely all the time\nThey have to say that again where she gets really good at the routine or whatever and she told to do it must be dirty dancing kind of the areas are are and I'm like oh\nAnd our eyes me half carrying her little\nHe realizes ice skating is hard\nLot more I'll run through these really quick if you want to a comedy that has very little to do with hockey uh got Adam Sandler back when he was funny it's called ... happy Gilmore yeah\nHe was a hockey player who goes in the Gulf and the other great a fight scene with Bob Barker and I've also got a movie that I'm not recommending usually I'll only give you the good ones that you should go out and watch for the fun ones like sudden death which are not good movies but fun\nJust wants to stay away from it is on Netflix now you can stream a with a push your button please don't make the mistake but I did watch this is Mike Myers movie called the love do real\nGood job on the way we ask our but you're pretty much kill his career for good decade and I kept thinking how bad could it be all bad over there is a hockey supplies yesterday was saved us hockey team and it is just absolutely an funny you might have that morbid curiosity that I had like what was what was ...\n... who don't remember what Mack says you know watch and then finally the one that brought up right when we started talking\nAbout the ... Winter Olympics with stars Mr Kurt Russell who's an incredible actor and I'm Talking about the true story of miracle you're probably the best hockey movie ever made by across his hairless ridiculous\nTo the movie is very very emotional and one of those it it's exactly the kind of showing you want to see you at the sports teams come from behind plus it's a true story is Americans are winning the gold Nineteen eighty spoiler alert we want [laughter]\nI'll tell you what were you weren't aware after\nWatching that it really does it makes me feel like that's where I Am an American does she want to go outside and wait around a flag and drink beer and I I don't I don't drink beer but I Would do is just because of I Would say\nLike at least in Nineteen eighty we were cool\nWell yeah sure I'm I feel like I ... I think I might be a miracle dreaming yes apps hungry although they may find everything on on I Want to get to know and that's about as well I told them they wait and love ... yes absolutely and how can we find you you cannot tell me about the other hockey films that might have missed out on Twitter at max movies\nThat kind of deal this is max ... you're listening to max movies on the big five fifty kids here is\nI Would if you were thinking about replacing your old that adding a new ones you're living a buddy McGraw million a year for our living at forty point being in their living room with over different\nDifferent options was green porches wire built in girls and ... just to name some what they have also operate their own lumber yard to supply all of the materials views were your project so if you're a professional or an amateur or are you going to go\nDoor living outdoors living off the deck and made them one hundred percent PVC provide superior said rach\nMold mildew and come in at the same color to choose from and you can get all the materials and you can do it yourself or you can have a professional courtesy outdoor living forty four and big Ben and cook with it for like three twenty five or how we were living\nWage Julie back for kids smart kids smart S.

Rated movie for grown ups and the other one's kinda ... Thirteen or ... and go see the kids who could not do a sea stars Warner who couldn't care less about SARS point\nA smoker I was talking about this and we got a phone call hours later during your show and so I'm here run the board I pick up the from the little lady son super cute\nI I'm Sorry I'm not calling by your show I was listening earlier today and McGraw was talking about this great movie for grown ups none of that comic book stuff you know is for adults in any really made me want to go see it but I couldn't think of the title I think it was venom [laughter]\nGoing backwards\nItchy and I I Would love the story because I mean God Forbid this this woman go out and pay to see better them and go why it might have\nThat in my garage and energy in the wrong direction of course I told her it was a SARS one so I and I'm starting to review with this because venom is rated PG Thirteen and a lot of comic book fans who around my age you know forty to fifty are\nVery upset by this because all the Internet's thinks this should be an R. Rated film with this giant monster creature and everything I have to try to make everybody calm down for a moment\nThen it was a created back in the Nineteen nineties rushing botch when comics were were very extreme and everything was dark and gritty and everything I was about Thirteen fourteen when the venom came out I read those books I thought they were great you know why I was Thirteen or fourteen this movie is rated PG Thirteen candidates for Thirteen year old okay\nAnd when you have all of these older neck beard saying well why isn't this movie for me this goes back to that entitled the geek culture you know when I was growing up in the eighties being shoved into lockers because I liked comics I never thought if the tide turned and being a geek was cool that they would handle it so poorly\nAnd they have they absolutely have their shoving pop culture into a locker and if everything isn't specifically for them meaning older white guys they get very upset about stuff and so it is okay for goofy comic book movies to be for teenagers\nI kind of think the sort of should be a couple of weeks ago Ethan Hawke got the Internet mad at him when he said you know he was tired of hearing people talk about comic books films as if they were the the great works of art that nobody is going to be watching ... feel like they will at an ...\nAnd he's exactly right there's didn't I Love ... I Love comic books but I have to say it's not the seventh seal and\nWhen did you say you know where the great political thriller as capital America the winter soldier no no it's not Robert Redford is in that and if you ask him what the best political thriller he's been involved in he'd say oh the president and his men you wouldn't say Captain America [noise]\nSelf [laughter] if you take her down there to Fifteen to twenty percent squarely damned people are trashing the film and saying it's awful I Will say\nThis is not a very good movie at all okay even as a Thirteen year old comic book movie but I Will say for teenagers who want to go see a goofy action based comic book film\nIt's very good but that's not who goes sees it come up with Trump's anymore yeah it it's a it's it's people who want to go see an R. Rated dead pull film\nAnd I think it's just sort of ridiculous now have there been complex films that have transcended the genre yes I think you've got the dark Knight back in two thousand eight that was ten years ago you got Black Panther earlier this year there are cultural touchstones in these are complex arms however let's not forget just like in the comics industry comics should be for kids\nYou know it's a great gateway into reading actual literature and I know that people are going to say well you know you're saying the ... I'm not saying that there's great works of art new game and sandman series is incredible the watchman books by Alan Moore are incredible worthy works of art\nBut let's not forget the venom is about this alien creature that guy is that um ... bonds with this guy and goes around each eating people's heads why should this be some sort of\nWe have to make this this David Lean picture no you don't\nDoes that work you know it exactly the foundation how did it how does it uh how how\nThat word you know actually the last time they said they had it and how does it a lot of hard to go about\nTesting pharmaceuticals heading for talking about the rockets are not allowed I'm Talking about the allegations\nRecruit the most vulnerable of us to volunteer for tests that more often than not end up killing\n... dot camera ever got out they were not vantage his you want to rock\nHaven't I like [noise]\nWhen my dad was growing up watching westerns or he'd go in the backyard you pretend to be a cowboy game that's what the character venom is it's just hey I'm going to be a big monster ...\nAnd and so I was sort of disturbed by my contemporaries saying well why isn't this an R. Rated picture for us growing up I don't want them to be an R. Rated to shiver up let's talk about this movie that has a ridiculously talented cast and I'm honestly not sure why you've got Tom Hardy I\nAdd Eddie ... bonds with the alien named venom and Tom Hardy is doing some a very strange performance here it's very physical he's almost been treating this like a buddy comedy\nBecause when he is bonded with this creature he talks to themselves and to do this in the books to uh in the books was a little more creepy even um started out as creepy but in this sort of just like a\n... a a buddy cop thing and he's doing these um the very physical actions flailing of arms and falling down almost like he's doing buster Keaton pratfall\nAnd so it so it's so that's what I realized watching the film oh this was a comedy and when Tom Hardy a is under control of the alien and jumps into a lobster tank at a restaurant and search eating the lobsters I realized that just goofy\nThe crowd was sort of uncomfortable laughing 'cause I thought it was going to be dark ingredients not his wife here is played by Michelle Williams used our Oscar winner and an incredible actress I don't know why she's in this movie either I mean I Hope she gets to fund some\nAnd the week I was on every Saturday Night and Sunday night eleven PM right\nHere on the big five fifty today show you know I'm going to keep you guessing but I'll tell you what [noise]\nWhat I won't keep me guessing about is just the Peterson the daughter Erin they are the retirement coach and ... respectively Saturdays and I am right here on the big science to dictate the air is\nI Am Jerry all your host I'm tired of listening to me because this shows all about you you and your memory\nOr you know\nThey need to speak\n...\nNo\nNo no no\nA\nYear\nWay [laughter]\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\nAnd when the men\nYeah\nA\nAt all I\nTogether\nYou know\n\nAnd it's just\nA a\nR A\n\nL ... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... with all of a sudden you most men they were going\nTo say ... we'll see\nWhat it takes a lot and ...\nTo me picking up the ... same\nWith music\nOr you know I think we're starting\nTo the issues that she really knew what on saving\n'em translated as I\nGo ...\n\nTo ...\nAnd ...\n\nMom ... on the news [noise]\nLet me see what brings you to do like [noise]\nUm ...\n... who's\nIn the early uh\n\nAnd ...\nThe money is no\n\n\nHuh how do we ...\n\nFar and ... oh oh oh\nYou are oh I'm\n\nHe's a ...\nMonth\nWe try to\n...\nA Luo\n...\n\n[noise]\nYou know\nYou don't need no\nLet's talk to me anymore\nWhen I go through the door in the in the ...\n...\nI'm going to\nBe like hey we we\n\nOh yeah\nIn all the right way\n\nAnd you don't need a new\nUse weasel\nWeight jokes you lay although many law which\n\nWell you know if you can picture this they laid the boy and yet I hit a button\nMusic starts rolling because we pulled the songs earlier in the week\nAnd I just sit and talk to you and listen to music just like you do thanks for the memories the best way I Know up to ... and Saturday or Sunday night it just makes you feel good about yourself and your life by letting you slip back in time to\nTime to win like Suzie is the\nMost complicated thing was following mom and dad's rules\nSpeaking of rules you want to know the rules about health insurance and retirement you should listen the jets and ... just some sanity straight talk on retirement and it does straight talk you'll love it\nIn the meantime you're tired of hearing me I'm tired of talking to you unless you saw sit back and enjoy the memories\nI Can't remember where I\nAm one\nWay or we ran through well every\nOh no\n\nOh\nNo no they use\nThe euro\nBut I mean\nIn the early ...\nLove is who they choose to give the\nBreeze or [noise] to read this the [noise]\nYou go ... or\n\n\n\nOr ... or ...\nOr\n... minutes [noise]\n...\nIn la la la la\n\nLa ...\n... ... and\n\n... one or\nOr\nIn the morning and [noise]\nThe world\nAnd your fingers\nOn the\nPhone\nNa\n\n... ... ... ...\nI get to do\nThe uh the ...\nThey they knew\nThat they have one in ...\nI live in ...\nLaw ... may say\nWritten ... you\n...
