to nine thirty at the Compton high water tower park\nIs a restore the truce rally hosted by the St Louis city central committee\nMC by Jim Jones former a state rep puts the speaker of the house

capacities about corn and things have any deny it has never happened us my lovely wife to come by no she is lovely and she's intelligent and she's\nA a great guest\nSo all very true we'll see what happens with you let me just start off at the heart act to follow up and be before we get going I told the story many times of losing to the twice convicted felon and how Iran a great campaign and I don't know what happened how I lost two to one\nUh sixty six percent of the vote went to the convicted felon and didn't go to me when people don't know and I've kept your name out of it up until this point Joe whoa this is you were in that campaign for me I was your campaign man\nYou just have to go and ask them you have to go out and get them and and not concede them to the Democrats\nOh absolutely and and the Vietnamese but right I mean that was a huge wave of immigration I was in the seventies and eighties primarily eighties but you know absolutely I mean and and that is what you know\nWe gotta we gotta we gotta crawl before we could walk or he can run I'm not even starting removing yet we crawling as an aspirin but but yes I mean what we want to do is put out there these are the ideas and then identify these folks that that that that understands the Democrats so far are not providing the new ideas that we need right\nUm what is this from a chair of the St Louis city central committee Republican central committee or give me your view on the city's economic future [noise]\nWell you know we ... we have a lot of assets obviously a and we have an enormous number of challenges and I think the concern is um you know tax taxes\nAre too high a it ... it was shocking my wife and I went into a Simon brothers I if I can talk about a company here but a wonderful local ... ah appliance chain\nAnd or inadvertently I was looking at the guy's screen as he pulled up you were bottom new washer he pulled up the tax rates between all their different stores mhm and by buying in the city I was losing\nTwenty thirty bucks or more you know I mean that's the I I Know contractors who no longer shop at the Lowes and that's a that's a yeah it's a ... ... ...\nY ... when I couldn't drive to the county and save X amount I mean that that is now if you know ... a little incremental changes fine and obviously we have a lot of needs but we can't keep raising that can't be the answer is raise taxes raise taxes raise taxes it it's going to kill businesses and then\nAnd I mean honestly probably the biggest economic development led to two big ones one is is the the the use of the misuse of the incentives\nUh you know we've incentivized way too many things that did not need to be incentivized and we've not had a a coherent plan for them you know look at something like like cortex cortex to me would is an excellent excellent example of\nGood planning you know you've got these two anchor institutions and you're building strength between them you're weeding out weak institutions your your fostering growth and then identified court or\nIs there that sort of plan for any of the rest of the city I mean it it it feels like when you look at the city\nIt's it's you know ... you know ... our islands washing or um that that they are all being eroded I mean the the basic\nConcept from Jane Jacobs from the death and life of great American cities is the weakest part of any where is the edge we need to be building strong neighborhoods towards each other so that the edges are reduced and I just I don't see any if the city is doing it I I have never seen a plan for and we desperately need it and then the final one being crime\nCrime crime is awful uh we have to do something about it and people say well what Jay and I say I don't know but you know what it's not my job I mean it is I mean again we have all these people we have Jimmy Edwards we had colonel head and we have mayor a cruise and and I'm not criticizing them but\nDarn it that's your job you know um and if something isn't working\nThen let's change and let's get it done I'm the same thing with education a high schools in in schools in the city\nSay oh it's tougher than you think yeah I Know lots of things are tough curing cancer is tough um you know even educating kids is tough but if you're not up to the task move over somebody else get in there\nWhy and and and the crime issue I again I I'm afraid that a little bit like taxes it's reaching a little bit of a critical point I mean I've I've seen some Mummers on Facebook and and you know the social media of like hey\nWhat's going on with some of our ... you know our our entertainment district seeing dead restaurants the no restaurants come and go they move on but they seem to be closing a precipitous right you know it it seemed like neighborhoods used to be ... you know some of these strong neighborhoods were expanding marginal properties we're coming online now they're you know going out of business they're contracting\nAnd I mean I I've had people now some of it may be irrational but rational or not I am not going to go there because of the crime should we have our event there because\nIt's a matter of faith in the reality that last question for Joe ... Joe ... is how many kids do get now seven [laughter] seven wonderful children they are all trying to kill me that the vote I vote I get some Christmas card\nOh I get trying to kill me yeah whoa die I get from Christmas cards you have a beautiful family to wonderful wife last question for Joe hostess clean Missouri I Want your are your thoughts on it because it is we've had a number of people on here\nI don't know that I'm In favor of it I'm In favor of points one two three and four but you get to five that's hitting down their point five and it becomes a whole new ballgame\nAnd I agree completely that is the problem I mean you I'm happy to talk about lobbyists perform I'm happy to talk about ... I'm even not against campaign finance right it's difficult but they're you know that's I'm happy to talk about all those things that that\nState demographer and that man during bill is insane you're going to draw a quote unquote competitive district you're going to draw a district that is representative of Missouri everywhere from one of those words even mean\nYou go to saint Joe all the way down to\nA ... and our lowest in drought to Maryland heights and even then you probably won't get enough Republicans\nI mean it's just one of these districts look like who you know what kind of representative is going to be representing I'll be one of our committee members called them spaghetti districts who is going to be the person who wins these districts it's not going to be representing an individual defined community you're not going to be able to do what you can do I mean one of the great things about Missouri state reps\nYou really don't have to spend a lot of money you can spend shoe leather and get yourself elected state rep\nNot under clean Missouri You will have no hope it will see will surely be a matter of fundraising is ironic but it's supposed to be this like let's get money out of politics and instead you're gonna turn the state representatives into\nThe only way you're gonna be able to reach all those people is through is through you know money you're not going to be able to knock on doors and be able to be a community leader and get elected what communities right\nWell that's what I always thought of politics and the local level and I consider local at the all demand it could be municipality at the state reps saying not so much because they're bigger districts but you're right there immunity ... you know you can pick up the phone and say you know down on such and such corner image state rep ago yeah\nYou know you don't have to say you know ten miles and you'd take a bus and\nYeah oh yeah I I I yeah I that part of it just does not do not understand it at all and as a result I I'm going to vote against it and where and where we are trying to work hard because again it sounds great and the joke about the you know a oh is that that environmental dang it's clean Missouri but but yeah that that state demographer thing is just a no go you know\nWell and and I get the sense that it was packaged with these other things that everyone can agree on\nWe want less corruption or less ... you know influential dark money all those things in politics yeah we all want that and then by the way we got this thing down here at the bottom so like the little thing on your TV they can't even read All right Joe whoa this give us one more time with is your event this weekend\nJoined us Saturday October the twenty seventh at Compton heights\nCompton hill reservoir man that's a tremendous adopted high water towers or go to a large our ... our now thirty nine thirty AM Sondra McDonnell and other folks being a clean Missouri come meet some fellow Republicans waves some science to have a good time\nTo All right thank you so much Joe ... is nine twenty seven here on all access which cancer when we come back don't go anywhere Ben Bradlee junior is going to talk about his new book a forgotten how Donald Trump won one county in Pennsylvania and took the White House will be back after this\nFive fifty online\nOn demand\nCheney why\nSolid as Ron\nHerman jak is the best way to stop the damage and cracking caught peddling foundation\nDepartment jak system supports your home on hydraulic driven steel peer support really is solid as route around how can you know for sure laughter\nIs installed each period hydraulic Lee tend to like other kinds of foundation the\nOld fashioned concrete reinforcement can't be tested under pressure you can't be positive to problem solve\nThat means the gas is harder to install not at all the perfect jak system doesn't require a major excavation large cruiser heavy equipment that means less ... less time and because it is effective it's usually less expensive in the long run laws permit jak it'd be a ... year round sometimes even from inside the foundation\nEconomical and\nSalad as rock call\nPerma jak today at six three six two to five to five five three\nStory it's called the ugly truth about time share everything you've done your family fiber by by the time I'm sure you need my help\nHello I'm ...

B. laser\nThat he's repealed a lot of er or almost all of Obama's executive orders some but not all light that he got out of the Paris Agreement and the Iran deal but on on other economic\nMetrics he really hasn't delivered for his constituents especially\nThe manufacturing I mean he was just almost an hour I lie to say that a manufacturing in these places like uh northeast Pennsylvania like West Virginia maybe Michigan was going to return is just\nGoing to yes while at how 'bout Cole Cole exactly the same thing calls are coming back no\nUh you know Trump talks about clean coal but uh no I I I I think in their heart or they knew this and um you know you also said that he was going to eliminate the deficit in eight years but his first budget ad seven trillion dollars to the budget\nHe said he was going to replace Obamacare that hasn't happened uh\nHe was going to um do a huge infrastructure bill creating a thousands and thousands of jobs that hasn't happened so in many respects he is not deliberate but you know they just like Trump\nMhm they just like him they like how he gets up every morning and uh\nDoes a tweet storm there like how he stands up and fix it to the press every day to the elite\nUm he just makes them feel good and he made them feel good about themselves during the campaign whereas Hillary tended to make them feel\nAshamed mhm by calling them deplorable and uh things like that\n... what about these people make you think that well let me start do you think that Trump has the same appealed to same attraction across the country or that he had in hand in certain County Pennsylvania\n[noise] well I think that the key to a twenty twenty and and perhaps even the midterms which will be coming up and just a few weeks which will largely be a referendum on Trump\nIs what is the ceiling on Trump's base his favorability rating\nHas been creeping up uh in recent weeks it's now forty five percent and according to the latest\nUh NBC News Wall Street journal poll and um so ... we'll see um I I think it it uh it depends what\nWhat what the feeling is and you know he he's doing something very unusual Trump or yeah I think he's he's behaving as\nPresident of his base more than he is\nPresident of the country he only in in the victory in is a an election night did he extended an olive branch out and say it was time to unite the country\nBut since then he's done nothing of the sword he holds these rallies in his favor red states around the country\nAnd he's bashing the Democrats all the time and there's been no effort to unify the country\nAnd we're so polarized now and I wonder if a for a Democrat in twenty twenty a running on a platform that would try to unify the country more would not be attractive\nAnd you know I Hope Mr Bradlee something does because I don't know whether you're a Democrat whether you're a Republican I don't see much good coming out of discontinued or divisiveness and\nIn especially when it is really gotten down into the mud politics is a full contact sport I get that but it's become a beyond that in these days yeah\nWell even the Trump voters that our future in my book uh even though even though they uh\nThey continue to really like an admired Trump they speak was fully of both sides being so again and not being able to talk with each other and but they don't know how to get there on a\nBridge the gap and I'm I'm sort of hoping that in my book might be serve as a vehicle perhaps a small bridge to get both sides talking with each other more but it really takes presidential leadership this is a leadership\nIssue this takes up a president or presidential candidate to say that this is really important you know we're all Americans we should learn to live with one another\nAbsolutely Ben Bradlee his book the forgotten how do people loved one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump's and changed America\nLet me ask you one last question is really this is the type of book which cries out for a region that if you will any plans to to get back up Lucerne county and follow in twenty twenty\nTwenty twenty I just went back there when the book came out but we had a had a\nFew events and I think
