five fifty ... won by being so\nWow here is Jason Kessler alive and the big five fifty a DRA\nAll access to a gambler over the past couple of days we've heard a lot about the\nThe tragedy of the shooting of retired police officer Ralph Harper\nAnd as the news continues to to come out on this case what we are hearing is that those that have been charged with committing the crimes are juveniles I've heard the ages of Fifteen and sixteen and Seventeen and at least initially\nA news reports are saying that these kids will be charged as juveniles and start off there in the juvenile system I've been practicing twenty seven years and I've never had any dealings in the juvenile system and don't understand quite frankly how the process works in that court\nSo I reached out and our guest this evening is judge Robin ransom she's the assistant presiding judge and the presiding judge elect of the St Louis city circuit court she's also currently sitting as a judge in the juvenile court system welcome a judge ransom\nThank you very much it's nice of you don't invite me a lot of people don't understand\nThe juvenile court system\nI think if you watch sitcoms and so on they talk about Judy I'm going to go to Judy\nI'm but beyond that people understand there was a system for younger offenders than there is the adult system which is the court system it's open it's public but we don't hear a lot about what goes on in juvenile court\nJudge ... maybe explain to listeners what is the difference between the juvenile system and the adult court system\nWhile the juvenile system um began predominantly from Supreme Court cases in the Nineteen sixties as kids were being treated as adults and kids were being detained without notice to their parents at some kids are being certified to the adult system\nWithout any evidence Sherry hearings at all and so\nBefore the fifties and sixties the mindset used to be that we know what's best we know what's best for kids and so they don't need all of the constitutional protections that adult defendants would get if they're accused in court\nAnd after the overhaul in the late sixties all of that's changed juvenile court is not punitive unlike the adult court the focus in juvenile court is restored of justice we want the community to be restored we want the child to be um\nRehabilitated unable to resume and normal life and society and in the community hopefully battered after receiving services in court\nUm we looked at the children their ages their maturity their basic lack of sophistication that maybe some adult\nA defendant's with ham and we feel that you know children really do need to be treated differently for example they're not defendants\nYou know they're called um the accused or the juvenile delinquent or the juvenile you know they're not found guilty they're educated so even our languages different as to how we respond to children in court\nAnd that raises a a real interesting question it may seem obvious and why do we have a one court for younger people in another court for\nOlder people who may seem obvious\nIf you listen to 'em out say prevalent discussions today\nThe pendulum is swinging towards children need to have more services they need more therapeutic interventions versus the tension and bank confined or there's a lot of information out about brain development\nRight now one of the things we hear all the time is that the the child's brain really doesn't fully developed until they're into their twenties right certainly not in and I'm a living example of a brain that did not develop well at Fifteen and sixteen\nI was doing stupid things all the time but that's I think that's one of the reasons and a good reason for that kids don't know the same things that adults now\nNow got play devil's advocate a bit though and I have an Eighteen year old son and so this topic is very personal for me mhm I agree with you that children\nDon't know the same I'll say twenty five and now they're actually as people who are twenty five an older but if you are the victim or the person that has been um\nA victimized by one of those individuals I'm not sure that a brain development or lack thereof is something that really you know it's going to hold\nA lot of a master for you when it comes down to how we're gonna handle a particular case and that's the courts honestly that's the courts main issue you know the court is to be impartial court is to be fair to both sides\nAnd when you're in juvenile court even with heinous offenses as the one that's been mentioned you know in the news\nYou still have a child in front of you who has been accused they've not been adjudicated though the chart is not true at this point\nBut you still are looking into the face of the kids who may be fourteen Fifteen sixteen um but you're also most of the times looking and faces of victims right and somehow it's ... it's the courts responsibility to to manage you know some type of um\nEquality and the fairness that's basically meted out to both sides and that's a very difficult balance to walk\nI don't know how you do it but that's ... [laughter] yeah that's a that's why you are the judge judge ransom and not me because that would be very difficult you could look into the eyes of both sides and and have real compassion for both and yet you're right there is a it's a justice that has to be\nA rich let me ask you this what ages are handled by the juvenile court system what ages two young and what age is too old to be part of the juvenile court system\nAnd let's say by the time the cases adjudicated he's sixteen and a half or Seventeen you you may only be looking at about a year of placement and a child at a children's facility\nAnd so there was nothing further to do other than that petitioning but then it would only be Twenty one so what I'm hearing\nIf they petitioned then they can ask to hold that child up until the age of Twenty one but that's it and\nThat and the Twenty one if you were in the juvenile court system the longest they can hold you still Twenty one there wasn't this and then at Twenty one you get sent to Jeff city or volunteer to one of the adult prisons\nNow that's dual jurisdiction that's a whole different programs um dual jurisdiction is under section two eleven point oh seven three other revised statues of Missouri and what that means as you have been certified your case has left the juvenile court\nAnd you are now if we're still talking about the same murder trial they were talking about a year now facing\nThe adult system and you're either pleading guilty are going to trial and if you're you know considered not guilty that's fine but if you're convicted or if you enter a plea of guilty\nAnd then your attorney can add to have you screen for what's called the ... program\nAnd the Y. S. has a certain amount of time that common interview that child and then they make a determination to the court as to whether they think this child is suitable for the program again it's within the discretion of the judge he or she does not have to accept that recommendation\nLet me let me ask you this are we talking vets if somebody's been certified to stand as an adult in the first place some really asking they're going to spend some time they're being um\nLocked up is just a matter of whether they're going to be locked up in his adult prison to begin with or part of the um the Y. S. program until they hit Twenty one or or or around that age and then they're going to move on but they've already been tried as an adult is that correct\nNo for dual jurisdiction oh I'm Sorry for dual jurisdiction they have already been tried correct or they are divided as an adult because that would have happened before the word adult trial so they've either been tried and convicted or are they going to play and then before sentencing\nThey do this investigation to see if the child's appropriate but it's still rests with the judge as to whether or not he or she wants to accept it sort of D. Y. S. says we've interviewed this child we think they're great candidate for this program and we can just do marvelous things the judge can still say\nI don't think that that's appropriate and then the judge has to actually enter written\nFindings as to why they don't think this child would be suitable\nUm if they accept placing this kid and the ... in the door jurisdiction program the juvenile gets two sentences you get one sentence and the juvenile system and then you get the big sentence whatever you would get in the adult system\nAnd then there's a monitoring of your behaviors in this ... in the juvenile um facility and if you're if you're doing you know all of the things that you should do and you're a model individual then chances are you can come out on probation or happier than it is and it\nYou know certainly if you commit another offense or if you're not cooperative the judge can have your sentence imposed the and they also see that was sent and they can be sent away\nHow do you go through that process I mean what factors go through your mind not in any one particular place but as you were looking at an individual I Know that I don't think I'd be a very good judge because every time somebody comes up to me and says I'm Sorry I really I I won't do it again I Want to believe him mhm\nBut we all know that that's not always necessarily true and even when they say second time like okay well this time they really mean [laughter] um how do you think how do you go through that how do you filter all of the the things that must be going on in your mind all the things you hear the excuses promises the tears the anger\nAnd and to try to reach some kind of equitable decision\nFirst of all and I tell people and I know a lot of it sounds cliched but you really have\nTo be a good person to your core to be able to see\nThe good and people that sometimes it's very difficult to see you know I've\nGot two kids Eighteen and Thirteen and when kids come before me\nYou know my running joke with kids if we're talking is that you know I Love all kids I like about just not my too you know and then he had to kind of you know they're just sort of as a nice where her but I think I look at it with the premise that\nEvery child that comes in court before me\nThey'd been pleasant they'd been respectful you know I think in all the years I've done this have had one kid pretty much just destroy a courtroom ... and that wasn't even directed towards me\nYou know when you look at it in the face and he asked that kid what were you thinking the first thing they're going to say it's not really wasn't right and you know I honestly don't think kids are impulsive you know it goes back to what we know about kids they're impulsive they don't think they do\nWhat we know about kids they're impulsive they don't think they don't say if I Do a B C and D going to follow all we know all of these things that generally that's how they operate 'em but I look at the level of of a fence I look at the age you know when I\nFirst started the main crimes were tampering if you own the dodge knee and you're in trouble [laughter] you know that was that was the big thing it was easy ticket Batman and now you know I'm hearing robbery first arm criminal action murder murder murder these\nAre crimes that I have not seen 'em that many of our say into like the last five or so years and so you're dealing\nWith kids who and I always say to the Internet is like the deem and that's what I tell my kids but kids are exposed to so much more and kids in our community are exposed to things that\nThey see now on a daily basis everything that they don't pay you know they see on a daily basis you know all of the things that they can have it they just go out and get and then you look at the dynamics and the family structure you know how all of those things have changed all of these things brings these children to court\nAnd when I see the parents you know my first thought is\nNo one in my mind give birth to a child or has a child and says one day this child's going to prison you know everybody has high hopes for their kids and somewhere\nAlong the way I'm that message is loss whether it's in the family whether it's with that kid whether it's because of peer pressure who knows but all of these things are things that run through my mind wow I'm trying to say what am I going to do with this and it's the weirdest thing there is something that's\nUm it's not a statute it's not a rule you get a feel you know after you've been doing it a while have I done wrong sure have I been right more than wrong yeah you know and that's that's how I how I have to look at it but everybody can't go to jail in adult court\nEvery kid cannot be detained\nYou have to try to figure out which kids are going to make it which kids have a chance of making it you know which kids are salvageable but why are you while you're doing that analysis you're also looking at his victim sometimes the victims are on board with I really think this kid deserves a bright\nBut many times they are not on them and it's very difficult to reconcile\nThat have you ever had the opportunity to see one of your successes later in life come across them just informally and they say oh judge ransom thank you for believing in me when you did\nYou know what's what's odd is at semi adult probationers on the street and they come up they can't wait to start a a kids you know not so much but I'll give you and it's not funny anecdote but it happened\nAnd my daughter and I wear breakfast and maybe within the next week I go to court and care comes to me and when we have a hearing and he says oh I saw you\nAnd I always say you know there's so many more people that see me I won't remember them and and so where did you see me on the weekends 'cause I didn't see you and he said you know we were breakfast and I was working and I saw you in a short girl I'm like I said well if my daughter you know and so we laughed and we talk that he was working and everything was going great\nUm and I you know I thought wow I got it right it was a kid I took a chance on right and within several months back it was back in court yeah on a serious offense mhm and so you know it makes you sometimes think ooh\nShould I have given that get a chance but you really can't focus on your failures or your missteps because every kid that appears in front of you there are different individuals and you can have five people in a row who all committed robbery and the first degree with with a weapon\nAnd it does not mean that the punishment or the ... the disposition needs to be the same for each of those kids because every kid's different and that's the thing that you really have to have a feel for\nIncredible judge
