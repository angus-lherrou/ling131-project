September was was wildly group\nOr in October and why aren't really not as good wildly not as good and uh we know that the markets are now basically they pulled into ... correction territory um we ... we hit our market highs for the year I Believe\nIn September and we just gave it all back in a beautiful three week period but that's what happens right its ups and downs that's why we volatility in the market\nUm we are going to talk a little bit about this morning our way\nWe are the first for those of you that might like to subscribe to our newsletter I thought we should give you a taste of what was in the October newsletter I ... the cover story\nAbove the fold\nDown the doughnut hole the Medicare coverage gap and we think this article because it's very timely we are in Medicare open enrollment October Fifteen through December seventh a great deal over your time to evaluate your Medicare coverage and make changes or stay where you are depending upon you\nIt ... and make changes or stay where you are depending upon your needs and the coverage that you currently have\nHere and I know that even open enrollment has only been going on for approximately two weeks though right that's right you see that you've seen and talk to a whole bunch of people suffer habits are yes\nI have and in keeping with our news segment we are going to discuss the Medicare open enrollment rock star of the week at some point today\nAre very good friends bother salary right that's right they're all over the place they are\nLong times clients in many different ways that we\nDo like to talk about Bob and Sally off for quite a bit of good I was going to say well we're we're certainly going to get to that this morning as well but I think what we should remind folks is that\nTo consult your friends about Medicare eligible for ... or ... or call Medicare directly because your friends don't know any singer or something you know what happens when you get a license or advice for people to earn a license\nTo well I I read it and read a quote on line a couple of days ago when you pay peanuts you get monkeys\n[laughter] right you have is when you don't pay anything nothing good I'm assuming but a exactly you want to\nGet advice from not just someone that's license with someone that's willing to take responsibility for the answers that they give you\nSo with that being said we actually have Patty on line one who has a question about spousal benefits will reduce the morning Patty [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOkay [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] retirement retirement age\n\nFor Patty unfortunately right\nNow while you are under normal retirement age under retirement age but all musing disability you cannot elect you can't elect more than one benefit nor can you switch over to a spouse will benefit you'll have to wait until\nYou're at least sixty two years old in order to make that adjustment if your disability benefit is\nLess than fifty percent of your accent benefit minus thirty two percent which most likely that's not the case\nAt sixty two you could switch over what naturally happens with disability is you stay on disability until your normal retirement age and then you're automatically switch to your own benefit for your Social Security retirement benefits at that particular point sixty percent of\nYour spouse or ... thousand benefit is greater than your benefit they would allow you to make that switch because technically you're not actually using Social Security retirement you're using the Social Security disability pots or you have it made an actual Social Security election yet [noise]\nYou know who they are sticking out from a from a dollar point of view [noise] since the Social Security disability benefit is generally the same amount as the Social Security no return with yes that I Would think that Patty probably\nFor me to even if she could which each year but she's really probably the best wishes she used today which is getting ... absolutely require equivalent to with those right\nIt just opened up the door in the future if patties benefit happened to fifty percent of her ex spouse has benefit happened to be less than what her full benefit is they would still allow her to make that change it full retirement age but right now you're definitely in the best spot available Patti\nMy other question\n[noise]\n\nWon't be here all our\nAnd when I get retirement\nShow your Social Security benefit is based on the top thirty five earning quarters that you've had show and right now you're earning more than you have in the past than your Social Security benefit will adjust up word incrementally based on that if you're not\nThen those numbers are just going to fall to the bottom and most likely or Social Security benefit will not change except for\nThe cost of living adjustment that he'll probably receive and you're at least you're eligible to receive annually if a president Congress approve them so like for example for twenty Nineteen due to a to point eight percent\nIncrease in Social Security benefit you all have access to that but if you're in your earnings are less than the top thirty five earnings that you've had the most likely that's not going to impact or benefit\n...\nCan go for a couple of a mind bender says this morning we're good questions we like that it was sort of like sort of like a mini worker\nIt's MORNING right good questions\nWe like that it was sort of like a sort of like a mini work out really good question and again these are ones that we see all the time during a coaching sessions which is for being able to get that um you know be able to get the information they seek is a cool thing to do in this era mission before there's a couple of ways you can do that\nObviously coming to visit with us we love to see it because we do see listeners every single week at the same time you can always go to our website submit a question and most likely it's going to show up on the show we liked the angel of yes we certainly like to in those in really all that becomes far for the show so you know again our phone lines are open as you know\n... ... just called but six nine Katie RS store Katie RS from your cell phones or one triple eight five fifty K. T. R. S.\nWhen the markets sliding\nWhich is you do not freak out\nYeah that would be the first one right now we know the ... percent off his eyes from last month um we've given back or gains a we've also falling below the two hundred moody moving average\nWhich is just what the what the ah index club what the at the peak load that over the course of the last two hundred days it's that that average number\nYes so what are some of the things that we think we believe you ought to consider do\nIn your thoughts are top it off which would stay calm right\nThat's right market corrections our normal we never mark it up into the right you know just a straight line up word that would be alarming I think to most um we need to clear out speculators and make room for new highs and also new buying opportunities\nRight and this is actually the second correction that we've seen a major one that we've seen her temper says so far this year we had the big move up in January obviously at the end of January beginning of February we should be you know came down and then we had the big move up all the way to the new highs in September and so it's a roller coaster so hang on right\nExactly in October is historically especially during the election year it's been a very volatile months because of that the market doesn't really like uncertainty and with heightened political\nDiscourse in the country right now I think it leads to increased volatility that not being the only point of ... of ... but one of the major ones\nRight because the markets hum truly are based on the expectations of investors so I'm emotions run high and if they frankly I'm really drive it's just it's just not a computer thing really is so that's really what drives things [laughter] so what can you do well number one is\nAlways have cash available right\nBut you want to have money set aside to meet your monthly income need as well as any short term capital needs that\nYou might have so you can whether these corrections because just like the correction\nOn that we experience at the beginning of the year by September we were at new highs so if you were able to draw cash that you had available you didn't have to sell into a down market you were able to wait for your assets to rehabilitate which they did over the last several months\nUm and just like now if you\nHad the ability to pull from cash as opposed to having to sell some of your assets in order to generate income you won't be selling into these down market\nAnd the world and so as as folks you've heard of\nLost every week we always recommend that our clients keep a six months position in cash at least the beginning of every six or up here\nSo that they can deal with these short term volatility issues that we see if you're not feeling comfortable about it or you'd like to have a little bit more casual you don't want to increase that to a year on a big deal\nI'm by no air and you had an interesting call the other day because somebody had written or article by David Columbus which\nCame out over the money magazine I feel like\nThey would set it all really\nRich if we should have called him David include ... [laughter] yes I think Justin ... years of cash\nWhich is a lot of cash it's nutty you the truth is is that um you know if we were earning a reasonable rate of return a cashier asked us today\nWe're seeing money market rates going up to one point five percent or so you know for the four to five percent area frankly the way with insurers rising we'd have even a greater\n... said he was as a fixed income alternative but five years is um excessive I think potentially excessive it's really it's really taking you out of the game\nBut in many cases um you know instead of actually having five years' worth of cash sitting around me folks do have um cashing in various places in their accounts in their retirement accounts but also in non retirement accounts right that's right\nSo having that reserve or cash is something that is important to you certainly want to continue to do that and also you know as you mentioned or\nAnything that you know that you need to consume especially we call the capitals ventures whether it's a car or whether it's home improvement college tuition for a child\nThat's where he should have any ... in anything within six to twelve once you are having cash anyway so I mean it should not be subject to market risk [noise] um the other thing is this market timing you know most of us today especially those that are\nThat we have several small groups that are on that are under five\nGrillo you've so if um if you're playing the ministry or isn't giving that are you so it was like you could avoid him to the straighter\nYou wouldn't want to give her off circle when we talk a little bit of border fence which is a record so thanks for the call to the\nGreat I'm All right and we have a sue on line to has a question about finding health insurance there you go\nWell not for me because I'm retired\nAnd I\nAgree that is that a friend of mine he retired and his wife and from work and insurance what's going to be a thousand a month for coverage on him and his wife than retired\nNow like a month maybe a little over a month\nAnd he just found out that it's that that was a mistake at his house and\nThe little mistake All right\nPretty crazy yeah so it's cost them on and and I was\nWondering if you help someone or find insurance fodder\nFor people that aren't we [laughter] well I I Do assist individuals that are retired but unfortunately um if you're under sixty five years old at least in twenty Eighteen the insurance companies in Missouri and some in Illinois no longer compensated brokerage for\nA facilitating enrollment into individual policies so we kind of step back from that market my best ingestion is\nWhat we do that but we but but we do do that for investment of ours record yeah\nOf course we assist for our investment advisory clients but for everyone else we've been referring them to\nThe health insurance marketplace because for this into at least through the end of this year are you still are required to maintain health insurance and the health insurance options that meet the ... requirements are found on the marketplace so that healthcare dot Gov\nUm after December thirty first of this year there is no longer the individual mandate to have coverage but I did just signed out recently that the subsidies are going to continue into twenty at least until two into twenty Nineteen\nSo using the marketplace could work too I'm your friend advantage especially if they're no longer working that might have brought their income down which could help them find a policy that is going to be partially subsidized by the government\nOkay and they need to go to a health care doctor\nExactly oh I absolutely think\nHe's very good you know that'd be great that obviously if they come in for coaching session was supposed to talk about\nTheir retirement plan you certainly can we can certainly talk about that sort of ... of course\nTheir choice who could qualify for loans are open today\nAnd it's great to get phone calls see what happens I or go so sweet nobody calls me well that all totally expected\nFolks who goes we do have a couple of talkers well to get to a we have been heavily talking about health care is we should be because it's this is open to ruin Caesar it is that we want to talk about the you're open enrollment rock stars of the week the missing with sports were very good for a\nVictory healthcare of Missouri\nCoping if it's right foot so let's talk about the above the selling\nBob and Sally they came to visit this week again again they'd been in several times this week but for this specifically we were discussing health insurance\nAnd these folks are actually a bit of ours records for a couple of years I Know that you've been speaking with him about health care for several years yes and they were kind of resisting worker yes\nBecause they hit the initially ruled in Medicare before um before they became clients of ours has arrangements and sometimes you got to work on folks right\nThat's right so Bob Bob he is Seventy years old and salary is sixty nine they currently have United healthcare it with a plan ... supplement that they pay two hundred and forty dollars a month for per person they also have\nA ... we started here though that's a traditional supplement ... do you do when they go to the doctor\nWretch right 'cause they get to pay two hundred and forty dollars a month to United healthcare the joy of that exactly their audit I'm at no prescription drug plans for twenty six dollars a month they are on a dental coverage for thirty six dollars a month they also purchased a vision policy for ten dollars a month\nTo buying stuff well they are\nI Believe Sally set it to me insurance for\n'em [laughter] which are they paying altogether to near\nPaying three hundred and twelve dollars a month per person which is six hundred and twenty four dollars a month she had the couple which is Seventy five hundred dollars a year\nAnd then it says that doesn't include report the does\nNo I don't but also I don't include party because whatever we discuss sure they\nGo for it but just for a listener so they understand that that's that is an including purpose\nThat you go that's correct and that's another you know a few thousand dollars a year worked for thirty five each sixteen hundred dollars a year ago thirty two rather so\nThe first thing that we did was discuss Bob and Sally medical care over the last year\nA Bob says he gets an ... allergy shot every week Sally in pretty good health but she gets an injection once a month and they didn't think Medicare Advantage would be a good fit for them for a few reasons at which I've heard several over the last few years um they didn't think they'd have access to their physicians [noise]\nThey didn't think that they'd receive the same benefits under traditional Medicare under Medicare Advantage as they do right now under traditional Medicare\nAnd they thought they'd end up paying more for the coverage under a Medicare Advantage plan than what they're paying now\nShow\nWas a true it was so exciting to tell them the incredible new is that it's not so give us a numbers give us a fever well basically before I sat\nDown with Bob and Sally I requested that they thought of medical questionnaire so we could get all of their physician and prescription that they are currently using so their maintenance positions and their maintenance prescriptions so we can figure out what the best bet would be\nFor me it was cool here is is that you were able to run those who your computer program\nThat you could actually right so I can almost pinpoint for example if you feel a certain prescription on a regular basis how much it will cost down to the dollar for you depending upon which pharmacy you select\nSo we can really key into what your monthly an annual expenses are going to be regardless of what type of a supplement to Medicare that you choose\n[noise] so that's just huge you know I mean you talk about peace of mind understand really what you're ...\nSo this is huge you know I mean you talk\nAbout peace of mind understand really what you're careful could be assuming new books of the road [noise] um I think we're ... for folks because we don't really plan for this on a chair workers\nThat's right so I found even before they walked in the door to see me this week that all of their physicians were in more than one network so that gives them a lot of different Medicare Advantage plan choice options which is good\nUm but you know I left his out Bob and Sally actually we're right they will receive the same benefits under traditional Medicare as they would under a Medicare Advantage plans\nBecause they're going to receive more better better first\nIn addition to medical and prescription drug coverage they'll have access to hearing aid benefits different companies offered us in different ways Coventry offers a thousand dollars per year United in essence offer discount programs for policies um [noise]\nThere they'd have access to silver sneakers which is a free gym membership um they will have access to dental benefits vision benefits each company works slightly differently United healthcare offers a thousand dollars a year towards um\nDental Coventry will offer two thousand dollars a year towards dental essence offers a buy a program in which you can get access to additional dental through one of their ... one of their Medicare Advantage plans\n[noise] so that's interesting so what happens is is that they were listening to the wrong you know the health care commercials\nThat well you know United healthcare is one of the unique planned that offers a plan out supplemental the traditional Medicare policies but also offers Medicare Advantage policies\nSo when you hear nothing when you go to the doctor for a decent monthly premium\nAnd have access to all the physicians you could ever dream of in your life that the traditional supplement\nIf you're looking at a when you're watching TV and seeing the commercials that say hey no monthly premium and low co pays when you visit the doctor you'll have access to silver sneakers vision dental that Medicare Advantage and United runs both commercials and they run them very frequently\nSo you've probably seen them the other incredible benefit that many of the companies have added this year and over the last few years and then over the counter benefit which means they will send you booklets\nAllow you to purchase items over the counter at no additional charge you for United will offer fifty dollars per quarter so that means you know it's things like anything from toothpaste Tuesday or attacked\nOr in these booklets at Coventry offers twenty five dollars a month so you have some different options there\nReno pro plant nutrition performs\nSays a big five fifty change ers St Louis\nFrom ABC News on the return from\nJust from the vast hours in the Pittsburgh

I mean all of them have jokes but that first and then was much more\nOf a of a heist comedy on this one is sort of being marketed these actually I'm waiting for the war just came out if you saw that movie you know it had dire circumstances dire results for most of the heroes in the AMC you enter this one is saying hey it's a family film come and bring your kids I Will say the man and the wasp is rated PG Thirteen\nAnd watching the film I couldn't really figure out why was rated PG Thirteen\nA lot of these marvel movies really pushed that PG Thirteen rating with violence and with language that depend unfortunate to see really a little kids in the audience trying to root on Captain America when you have some salty language in these films and I don't know why the studios do that if they're trying to be edgy if they're trying to placate the forty year old in the audience but\nI was really hard and the ... men and the ... is a marvel film that you can take the entire family so you can take your grandma you can take your grandkids everybody's going to like this movie if you don't know what's going on in the moral universe as of now I Can't catch you up I Can't\nIt's been ten years and there's been twenty movies so if you just want to go and laughed and maybe go see a ocean page which is just a straightforward heights comedy almost like the first ...\nNot keep talking about that first ... from being a heist movie and that's because I don't know how to describe ... men and the loss\nThere's no central plot here as you can hear by the title it's got eventually lily as these super hero was she was a founding member of the Avengers and the comic books but this is the first time\nThat uh that she's been a full fledged superhero the character bent on it was in the last uh movie but she didn't have to pursue like she has here she doesn't empower them in which means she has a suit which allows her to shrink really small and you can also super sized objects ... usually for music affects there's a\nPEZ dispenser that's a Hello Kitty that gets gigantic and it it's really cool special effects that will make a they'll make audience laughs\nBy the end of the first don't change I mean it won't take time to fully resolve all of her hurts her father but you know the the first step to the late and a lot of forgiveness that happened on she had a really good price\nAnd so it was exciting to have the chance to go back to this character and pray her ... states that was not guarded ... cold but let's warmer and I'm\nMore of a little in her own skin\nWith a film called ... men in the last I was really hoping that the wasp would have a large role and have a lot of uh weight behind it and really they don't spend a lot of time with her I mean her suit is cool and she gets to punch the bad guys but the movie is much more focused on of all people Michael Douglas\nMichael Douglas in the first man had a a is really expanded cameo not a giant role as the original ... he was Hank him he was the man in the sixties okay and he trained Scott language played by Paul road to be his protege to be the new ... well I guess he enjoyed his time in that first movie because this is almost a buddy movie\nSoon was happy to say hello to you and we're happy to see you back in ... men in the last great yes yes you\nIn my opinion GI were one of the highlights of that first movie each and I've seen him in in the western three of you were greed in the sequel as well so what did it just so you were happy to your your character and all these years back\nYeah I Am so happy we call ourselves\nOff or when you're starting to look at it\nAnd we've got our off there's no bearing and we had a fantastic time helping the ant man and the first film but now we're ready to be\nBut if the owners who want to add a a real legitimate career and and and all of a sudden we get old rights activists who um side of an adventure with and and now for war\nAnd I'm yeah I'm very excited for people

see the movie because I think it's one of the top of a long time\nYou know you have to be one of the fever actors because just like when westerns really huge all those years ago you had some actors who loved playing cowboys and Indians when they were growing up in other actors you just a paycheck and I'm looking at your ... and your she'd be worked awesome and the flash in the dark Knight ...

Robert England Robert how are you today\nI'm good my favorite time of year Mac\nThough you know what it is also my favorite time of year actually got married on Halloween and we're gonna be celebrating ten years this fellow in\nOil congratulations [laughter]\nWell I also have to say I do you hear this all the time but I never thought when I was growing up but I Would be able to speak to somebody who was actually the living embodiment of so many nightmares and so I as somebody who couldn't even watch the trailers for your movies when I was growing up I suppose I should say with a question mark thank you\nSo You're welcome [laughter] that was a dirty job max but somebody has to do it\nOn your back underneath the Freddie Krueger makeup once again for an episode of the Goldberg's I imagine there's been enough of a break since Freddie versus Jason ... this ... I Hope it didn't feel like a chore for you and maybe something a bit more fun\nYou know I so protective of their character Mac and and I tried to you know stick up for the integrity and the scary ...\nKrueger over the years has been absorbed now by popular culture you know he's in comic strips in comic books and cartoons on the same thing as he's been on Family Guy and south bark and work and more and there's a lego action figures and locating the couch\nAnd all this stuff that I and and comedy T shirt\nI sort of realized that that that I could like get myself permission to a little fun with that character and my my agent favorite show is their goal urged\nI'm such a huge fan of ah when did like Lyndon cubby fan of hers since bridesmaids I just thought it would allow myself to go do a little cameo little sort of Halloween Valentine's for the fans\nAbsolutely and you know you were so fortunate to help treat this character of Freddie Krueger because\nEvery other horror icon out there and you know it's a man behind the mask if a man with a giant chain saw what have you and you do this character so much personality and you're right I mean obviously in the sequels got a little bit more comedic but you always had that that tough edge to friday and so I imagine the fans who tune in\nTo the Goldberg are going to be able to see some more iconic moments from Mr Robert English\nIt's fun but what I realized that I cited over the years max is that during the video revolution and the revolution in technology of a lot of families watch nightmare on elm street together and\nI never thought of it at the time I never thought of it that way I was ever wanted to do with the movies that I was in the movies and I never thought of it as being this experience\nAll around the family television was in a video of one of the news sequels that nightmare on elm street in the family would send out for me [laughter] you know and beer and watch it together but over the years I've had so many fans\nTo me about their fondest memories\nGrowing up with their mom and dad and their older brothers and sisters and stuff was going to the mom and pop store and renting one of the night right now the St Louis mom and dad would let them she was a movie or going to blockbuster or whatever and bring it home and watching it in a home with your siblings or your parents\nAnd the episode of the\nKind of addresses that\nAnd if they're going to put her really kind of addresses that uh in in not only a fun way but also in a kind of retro eighties\nMorality away and I I\nI had this told me thousand times over the years about somebody's remembers their father and end up in the most intimate times they had with their dad or their mom or their aunt or somebody was was was watching one of the movies at home on a weekend\nAnd a dessert but Goldberg's really deals with that Adam Goldberg had a very similar experience\nAnd uh I when I saw the strip that just like yeah this is a\nIf it's if I'm ever going to do a little favor for anybody or to a cameo this is the time to do it because this is an aspect of the film that people don't realize because I used to get in trouble for being friday was to violence and oh it was to scarier too gory\nAnd now I've learned over the years that in fact in a strange way it was a family experience\nThat is just wonderful you know I I also I always love you and we're screaming we're able to reach him for new nightmare that's a wonderful film and of course was great in that too will\nNot to my favorite new nightmare yeah\nIt's just a wonderful wonderful woman you are great in it as well neither you nor west team from the horror genre really I mean once was a professor and you are classically trained doctor when you were working on that first movie I I imagine you both sort of teaching to the more subtle mythology of assumed the bigger thing is the bigger themes that first film was really talking\nAbout I think it's even it's even part of all of the films you know friday friday becomes ... and embrace humor that west straight and gave him a little too much at the end but a kind of structured all of that in there you know which movies are about loss of innocence and they're about surviving in the world\n... carbon university city ever to Manchester would river\nAre all Israelis shipping and\nLet
