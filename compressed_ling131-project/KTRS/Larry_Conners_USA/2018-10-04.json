years and he has written I'm just a great informative interesting\nUm you call it a chronicle as opposed to a biography maybe you can explain that put the life of bill Monroe the lights and music and the bluegrass men white calling chronicled not a biography\nWell Jay thanks uh I I'm trying to a cover bills entire life and the important\nThing is uh events that occur during his lifetime and a sort of explained as I went along and gave certain insights into his\nPersonality over the years I didn't uh I didn't can capitalize it in one paragraph particular aspect of his personality I let it be revealed as the book went along with ears in chapter\nChapter to deals with the twenties chapter three the thirties chapter for the forties\nChapter five the fifties and so forth on through chapter nine which deals with the night is\nAmazing career amazing breadth and depth of demand now he is a I think believed by almost everyone to be the father of blue grass\nAnd almost everyone played with me including Earl Scruggs and Lester flat but in one point in the sixties and we played the Beverly Hillbillies songs when Scruggs implant got together\nThere was this huge going on where others were saying you know what I'm not bill Monroe Earl Scruggs who is the um the father a bluegrass nice I think that really dumb and ...\nWell they were they were competitors for many years Jay and uh\nUh you know that not necessarily on good terms with one another but they were not there was no feud involved necessarily there was no\nHatred but they were they were competitors and uh especially after the scarves and their band or joined the grand old Opry in\nA war became\nIncreasingly well known um people mistakenly considered a Scruggs badger picking as the primary aspect of blue grass music it it's a very important part of bluegrass so very very important part in that\nBut a really bluegrass began without the banjo Nineteen thirty nine and all the aspects\nOf a particular characteristics of the music were there and thirty nine and carried forth with great popularity until Scruggs joined the band\nAnd that was only forty five\n\nYet now life on the road in the forties and fifties and sixties with the bluegrass boys was not easy and you talk about that it's very interesting he was not a particularly glamorous lifestyle a lot of time driving low a long hours and and consequently\nThe bluegrass boys did their list of alumni is very very long including\nMany many members uh got into it and found out that they couldn't afford to have\nA family and and\nPlay music and that survey heavily on the other a ...\nA bill always paid their union scale a musician and scale and and uh uh for many years it was it didn't amount to much but uh if it's just a bare bones a type of existence financially\nBut everybody including yourself wanting to play with Bill Monroe in the bluegrass may I ask ... that he\nWas he was the guy but a really good saying could play could write a it was a great showman he could put on a show he was appealing to\nA specially appealing to the southern audience and the the ... some folks lived another country and he had a very great falling and so he was the man to work with if you're going to play music yeah\nSeniors out there he worked very hard it was through his time on the grand old Opry\nAnd they can't shows in just touring dang out there that bill top bluegrass were other John runs I guess since fallen by the wayside over time maybe even spoke for example um and I think it was\nOne of the review said you know there's a reason that bluegrass to survive in some of these others haven't in that bill Monroe in what he did over fifty years\nWell yes he contributed mightily to the shower or yeah he sure did she not only started it but are kept it alive for many years through\nMany difficult times uh when bluegrass would take a dip in popularity in rise again in ... there was a very elite a rule of law rolling hills type of a situation with bluegrass he uh he was a turban to\nPlay his kind of music is way and then he knew what he wanted right problem here with us from his help he called his musicians is held\nBy itself is amazing it is so detailed in Seoul descriptive how long did it take you to gather information and put it into this form\nWell Jay I'll tell you that it would have so many years that I first saw bill a nearby here in Ohio where I'm living right now in Delaware, Ohio in Nineteen sixty three\nAnd a after that night I started to really pay attention to the writings that we're a out there published\nHim and so I think a bit I think that's what I started actually in the sixties or eighties wow and so but I most intensely worked on it starting in about a two thousand one and a pen or that I moved to Kentucky\nAnd lived there for a living near as research too early live\nIn a two thousand five so uh well I don't know\nIt's been a long bus I Can't I Can't really live at exactly how long it's taken but how long ago with six to three let's see uh thirty forty or fifty here\nAnd I don't want to scare anybody off say you'd see luminous work and that's a good thing and but he's got that detail in there and yet the story that kind of\nBut it's got that detail in there and yet the story that kind of get progress is that you find yourself attractive and and living the life of bill Monroe and everything he was going through\n'em and then the music um again just to the description of the the instruments and the mandolin I'm a big fan of the mandolin and that was it that was his uh his
