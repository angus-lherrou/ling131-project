not talking about that how do you gauge them and say I'm that's an interesting point of view I'd like to hear more or that's an interesting pure point of view have you considered this\nI'd love to hear what you do out there are All right but first\nIt is in sight theater company\nDoes still some of the moment I'm Jen plays the piano as well as things beautifully and that kind of creeps through

it's a\nThey don't have to scream they don't have to I mean if they can act there's a big difference between TV and film acting and theater acting because television film was much more with your face because\nThe little a facial movement at the Fox theater is not going to be saying right or the ... black box theater you're still you still have those opportunities decried act\nNot only with your words but with your face in your body\nYeah I Love that um the last character that I wanted to make sure I mentioned was a is Chrissy steal a wonderful actor she is also part owner of all ... banks

entirely different perspectives on life on our Facebook page than the ones that we met here in St Louis and that's great\nThat's great makes it interesting yeah I Wonder would like to throw out there to the group nine six nine five eight seven seven star Kate your estimate for one to six eight for one to six is the the text message or what do you think there's some rules and so um if you will guidelines I'm the first thing I think of is\nA question would you agree or disagree or you are what you post or you are not what you post in terms of if you ever you know forward that something shared something\nI'm just in sharing something I think sometimes I've done that a because I think the person that uh originally posted it\nDeserves to have a a shared even if I disagree with it that doesn't necessarily mean that I Am buying into it and then I've been attacked for how could you share something like that what do you think about that you are what you post yes or no\nNo I don't think that's true I I think that's an unfair standard for anybody to to hope to aspire to I'd like to think that you know we we are the best people we can be on any given day but the reality is we just aren't and we're we're going to say some things are going to do some things are gonna share some things that probably aren't in keeping with our highest best self right\nUh so I think a little you know just just a little latitude a little forgiveness for our friends that maybe put some stuff out there that's a little bit a little bit\nIffy I think that's fair now I Will tell you that I I you ask her early ... and I can think of a particular instance and I won't show the details but it will tell you this friend shared a mean that ... ...\nWas condoning a kind of violence against a certain face groups you're on the base of on the basis of what happened on nine eleven and it was ugly and it was loud and it was unacceptable right so when you share something like that now that says more to me about you and I really think I Need to I an\nEgg egg I Would agree with you on that I don't think you are what you post but I think you if you are posting things at the extreme I think there's no room for posting\nA pro Nazi pro Hitler pro I just I Can't imagine why you know you would head down that road debris similarly um posted woods I'm suggest violence on any one sure um I I agree but different political points of view different uh ...\nUh points on a spectrum when it comes to an issue I think that's okay once in awhile to say hey I heard so and so uh I heard Mitch McConnell suggests this I just thought I'd share it may not be what I think but you know what\nYou know it's important because he said he's a speaker of the er the the the Senate so yeah um I I tend to agree with him\nAnd he had a problem and we get into their though is that we've got such a a a fragment or a segment of media climate today that you know most people who share means like this don't have the entirety of the story they don't they they maybe don't understanding tired of the store they see a piece of it that appeals to them and so they'll they'll tear it up right but that's that's not the complete deal\nWith that is a nice segue into my next question what in your experience out there with the folks and again this is a I'm Talking with Craig Williams I'm In a ... one of those people on social media that really encourages actively engages folks isn't simply out there a fire bombing from the the back rows ... is one of these people that\nAre wants you to engage him and wants to engage with others in a discussion and as a result of that I'm curious have you found that\nPeople are too willing to believe things that are factually on true and rely upon them without any investigation\nWell sure I mean yeah that's that's the nature of our of our polarization painting that's one of the primary causes of our polarization [noise]\nUm yeah you just get into a situation where you're going to want to believe something because it was shared shared to you by your favorite\nYour favorite best buddy or you know your your your your spouse's sister or something like ... got to be true to who insurance on that wasn't true tomorrow that really at now but you know we we strengthen our arguments I think when we invite\nA you know a\nOpposing points of view absolutely how or do we have anybody on the excellent aid for one to six if you'd like be part of the program like the three one for a rule that should that people should research the truthfulness of what they post before they posted\nOn couldn't agree more you know what I found and I I I was late to this game what snopes snopes dot com yeah in terms of like there's a website out there that really and you know people live attack snopes as being a they're just now know everything I've ever looked up on snopes has been well documented in a\nWay you lead them snopes now has been has become politicized and that's you know well we're we're is the you know where ... where is the uh the hearts centers of this thing right oh\nI again it'd be what I always question and always encourage people to have you with a bit of skepticism is any photograph\nYou you saw a lot of it and um you know in five white cheat air ... six white cheerleaders holding up you know ah things are the cards it's spelled out the N. word or thing for 'em and you go oh my God that's so outrageous well\nPhoto shop folks you know I mean again you have to be so careful with photo shop that it turned out that is not at all what they are the real photograph wasn't if they were at a Trump rally they had some but that's not what they had done 'em and it happens all the time got to be on your toes\nYeah you've got to be on your toes and so um when you don't try to check into the accuracy of these things you are out there perpetuating the worst that society has to offer and um\nWe even did it here oh yeah yeah what was it what is what did I Do I send it around but um yeah ... ... everyone's gonna get caught the question is slowly here's the thing locked in and and on on what kind of topic\nWhen you do get caught and it's clear that you've gotten caught right please retract don't doubled out\nAll the just just speaks to just how committed people are to their particular poll or a day when they did somebody points out ah and I've seen this over and over so you put the they get caught they say this isn't true and they'll say yeah well he probably would have said it anyway [laughter] he said worse [laughter]\nWalk away from it like the Minority Report of social media [laughter] oh my goodness my goodness we're talking with Craig Williams we're talking about rules on social media\nA move things to do not to do it for one to six if you have any suggestions comments nine six nine five eight seven seven is is the number or they're topics that just cannot be discussed\nOut there well no I think I think everything is fair game you know I Will say you know there's a ... of course you know she told their table thing don't talk about politics on TALK about religion lives are you kidding me right now those are the most interesting things to talk about\nRight there is there anything else out there I'm right now there is there's baseball started the hockey season but no I mean it it is this country has become a politics and to some extent religion if you include the immigration issue the Muslim issues\nAnd to some extent religion if you include the immigration issue the Muslim issue the Christianity issue the middle eastern issue\nIt's all kind of a tied up in a one big bumble\nWell it is and it starts to resemble theocracy at some level right in some in some folks threats and their feet and um you know the certainty of faith to something that's always be God help me you know I I Know you're a man of faith and I I I Love that I respect that most of my friends are but the very notion that we'd be certain about something like face ... little room for discussion [laughter]\nNo no no I think you can and that's why I've\nNever been a person to say ah my way or the highway that ah Christianity or my ...\nProtestant denomination of ... ... ... is by any means the only way and I I often talk about this\nAnd I have no way of proving any of my faith that you can't do it but I just decide based on what I Know what I Believe in in what I Want to believe because a lot of it is right you know hope when the wing and a prayer um\nThat that's I Am willing to go that route but I I Can't you know I\nProve you're wrong and I have some friends that are so my best friends you know some of my best friends are atheist you know that you know they are yeah and I'm okay with that yeah the why in the world I wouldn't be\nWell I'm right there I mean I'm not atheists yeah and it used to be five years ago I think are maybe eight years ago you know that was a dirty word you can say that and you know maybe maybe you still can't say that in certain circles but we're saying it right now yeah\nWell and then again the thing that people always want to say yeah you like them but they're going to help [laughter] I don't think that said that I just not I I don't know why why do know why I mean I just don't believe it and I don't think\nThat a loving God would send some what the hell simply because they were unsure addict given a period of time that is there are thought differently maybe not sure because that's a a a pejorative it kind of meat judging you know I have a different point of view\nBut I think I'm sure is a fair comment because we're talking about this snapshot and right at this snapshot in time that's how I feel maybe I'll feel different in five years yeah\nThere
