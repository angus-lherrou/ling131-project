S. you know every year thousands of men and women are released from prison and they need jobs and you know how hard it is to get a job it's even\nHarder for ... well the laughing their bakery in St Louis requires a pass felony as a condition of employment\nOr joined in Studio by to board members that the laughing ... Jackson is a secretary and George Lombardi recently retired as director of the department of corrections George started so many programs that to Missouri department of corrections puppies for parole and required all Missouri prison to engage with were sort of justice projects and we'll have more about that\nIn a moment but Georgia's nationally known for his innovative leadership and the feel of corrections so thank you both very much for joining us on the inside um\nFirst of all how difficult is it for a former offenders to find employment\nExtremely difficult from you know they have a cell phone number back and people really don't want to take a risk crude somebody like that\nSo even if you've done everything you possibly could while you were cars ready to take advantage of every program whether to sort of justice education substance abuse treatment when you go out with the best of intentions\nFor mom or you walk in the door to apply for jobs and they tell you that we don't hire felons it's very disheartening and if you have a propensity already as you've shown by being incarcerated to kind of say oh\nYou know it's very easy going to fall back into what you did before you came in most of the time it's going to be drugs or alcohol so it's very very hard and you\nGet such a wise investment to hire an ex felon\nBecause I'm\nBy doing so you keep her family together sometimes you saved that particular individual um what what people don't realize is that you don't\nThen that person may commit more crimes so it's a public safety issue in the long run for communities to take a chance in hiring extra for members\nWere you mentioned the fact that I'm even asking the questions sometimes can be like the end of an interview there is a movement in several states to get rid of that on job applications Danny by western up right exactly does it work is that the right way to go\nWell I think it is a providing that I'm\nThe founder that goes in there as honest about their background donors thing that could happen is they go in they don't talk about what they've done then six months later the boss runs out and out the door they're gone\nAnd they've got something to hide there was a sword of Damocles over the whole time anyway\nZach worded exactly so but I think it is a good thing but only if in fact the in the ... shirts with their background was and gifts the opportunity to explain how they're different now than what they were before they went to prison\nHas to wear is laughing bear bakery and how does it work well\nRight now we're located in a small business incubator kitchen in the basement is engineering Methodist Church that's at sixteen and olive oil and by the way it is ... days so if anyone wants to drive by\nAh we are selling pies are and how it works is that a quite easily people have been finding out if they are released from prison that this work a work skills ... program as in place for them and so we have a line of people waiting to to have a job\nWe hire them we train them to work we establish a work history for them so that when they go on to apply for other work they're they're more qualified and we pay them up as a minimum wage has well does it\nPay for itself or do you get outside funding\nRight now we're still in the early stages and so we are not paying for ourselves you know with every new ah ah\nOutlet that fills our products every new person that makes a donation where we're getting closer and closer to being south and there's like any small business\nAs exactly but laughing they're basically the nonprofit ... cells that some of the desert straps\nAs one of the first to a local uh\nOutlets to carry on products and they carry are their candy which is highly addictive and delicious and we're very grateful just drives for taking a chance on us and and we've been there for\nA little over a year to how many employees work into laughing Barry bakery right now I I think we have about five you know and we can't really uh hired many more people than that right now in our in our circumstances but uh you know like I said with that with every news\nSale and and every new custom era where were better able to fulfill our mission of hiring more ex offenders George\nJennifer mentioned some of the things that you've been involved in in the past before laughing better bakery why the interest or did they come from with us her story behind that\nWell you know I my background is I have a master's degree in psychology so I you know I've always been interested in\nThe fact that people can change if you give them the opportunity and after forty one year\nThe fact that people could change if you give them the opportunity after forty one years in corrections\nOr which correction started in corrections I've come to realize that if there was a characteristic meat missing in offenders\nHis compassion for others tend to manifestation of compassion witches altruism giving to others so if we can implicate\nAnd two people who never eat an added to begin with or the lawsuit because of childhood trauma and I'm telling you there's a lot of offenders who are in prison there had childhood trauma in their background\nYeah if we can do do that then I think\nKept a Journal of what he did and no one ever chickens and I don't I make a book of this where are you worried that people weren't going to be interested in this\nYes this is a book about botany about science fortunately it's a book about adventure also yeah and an added some energy to this very scientific\nAnd transformative work he was doing but this was a man who circled the world he went to fifty countries all of them by boat in search of exotic crops what year what time started an Eighteen Ninety four I went through the Teddy Roosevelt administration you know that's where the Taft administration all the way after World War one\nSo were these sanctions by president saying go find something delicious yes\nAh in the earliest days of America all the way back to Thomas Jefferson there was an effort to find crops in other countries are very few things what we eat today where in our markets are from

was\nYeah that rates are actually sterile there is no seeds so they can't reproduce naturally but ah but then how do we have more see and that's the way we called them we graft them take cutting Z replant the cutting that's why every great that you have is similar to the great you had last week it's also grafting and and cloning is why you have\nGranny Smith apples and Fuji apples and a naval oranges you have a uniform crops diseases watermelon yeah but you can expect season after season that are exactly the same\nBuys the seated grapes anymore\nI mean who wants to deal with that\nYet [laughter] you could buy them or they're around it's a matter of taste if you're making wine sometimes the seed provides a nucleus for ... for the fermentation\nTo his ranch of that to make your own wine from grapes from the grocery store and I used to I used to be elite to have see the scrapes an elite to buy seated grapes yeah interesting so limestone exceeds either so they climbed\nA lot yeah

extent of the government behind training who did it and and prosecuting them but then he turned around and and and seem to go after the media\nIt shouldn't be surprising at this one this is the president returning to a playbook he is not accepting any responsibility for the tone and tenor out and of course there is no responsibility to assign yet as of yet to anyone around these attacks\nBut I I think it's a moment that it's sobering for everyone and whether or not the president recognize it I think I think it is widely recognized around politics that something has to change\nThat this is not healthy that this was very close to being absolutely tragic an awful this week and then not just about threats but about actual violence and\nUnspeakable violence and I think it's a moment to to reflect on where we've come and where we need to go and that we are\nIn a political season and there are a lot of awful things being said or across the political spectrum but truly no need to know use and and no role whatsoever for this myth sort of a ... actual violence and threats there oh\nI think the the what about is a more the both sides is around looking at the other side of it is a is a totally unproductive exercise and I think if anyone were to say I am totally blameless them is a bit in the conversation and\nIf you're going to see a change I think it has to be a universal
