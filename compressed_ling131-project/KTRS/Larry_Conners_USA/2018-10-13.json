and\nWhich is just wrong yet at the ... not going to help you sell your head no I I you know because you're asking price again and again putting ... ... lead but the Virgin Mary stimulant or I

first show fantastic\nWhat a great bunch I Love coming back\nHome I really do St Louis is it just feels that feels right every time I go on stage here because you know she's home and I know what everybody here's kind of into where normal people and I love St Louis was really like right in the middle of it all we get it all happened totally will the let me be promote your show another show tonight to tomorrow night\nGet it all happened early well let me be promote your show another show tonight to tomorrow night to eat\nI have one and I have one and exactly six minutes folks if you're out of the funny bone or you're listening to gear radio outsized is already a parking lot rush on end and uh we'll do that so six minutes and then we got to tomorrow we got a seven to nine thirty I Believe so\nNow you said I was very funny off the air we were talking about the the opener I'm a very funny man just been to LA and yeah Charlie\nWinfrey and I've seen him for a million years he's always been pretty solid but he went out to LA came back he's really good\nAnd we talked about it lots of people say I'm heading to LA lots of people do that and then come back because everyone has to LA and there's only so many stages and write a whole lot of people right or did you ever try that\nI uh I used to go out there for auditions and uh you know tapings I was on star search really\nBack in the day yeah yeah I'm only lost by a quarter star really add to the eventual champion was in the eighties it was so yeah there it was around Bob zany our friend Bob he was on the air attack he did yeah so I thought I did pretty good you know for a\nMale spokes model [laughter] you weren't in the comedy I wasn't I was just a minute [laughter] yeah but uh I've\nDone my stuff out there I don't like LA you know I mean I like LA I don't like Hollywood I don't like all the people that all the stuff you see on TV about Hollywood if there's one show on television that has the most dead accurate thing of what really is is like out in Hollywood\nIt's bow jak horsemen I don't know if you guys have ever watched bow jak horsemen but it's ... ... everybody out there is exactly now we've had isn't cartoon right when that ... you\nKnow that's a that's a dead one ah but this is one where uh it's um well our net okay\nBasically playing a guy who was in a TV show like full house back in the nineties and then now he's trying to get on with his career it's just all these horrible people and they're all you know anthropomorphic animal fingernails number that's really funny but it's it's it's so close to home that I had a hard time watching I was like man this is almost like a documentary\nHorses in mid western guy going out they probably have tons to offer I\nNothing absolutely nothing I got nothing I'm done I'm I'm a let's see I'm I'm white I'm straight a recession I got no debilitating\nDrug habit if my parents never Fonda may I have nothing for people out in LA I mean those are the things they want to know I'm never going to write a book [laughter] I got a book\nI got nothing so uh you know that's that's terrible I shouldn't say that because now I'm never going to LA so I just hope is this going out to how many people hopefully as well as well and people but important people yes indeed so I'm\nNow you know what you're doing any film working because why don't you don't really do work and I don't know why we're not using your film and tomorrow with Reagan your and that's why ... and uh and I don't pay right that's exactly why\nThat is one hundred percent right and I am I'm sad guy and I I don't ah you know the ... that's a hard thing to do is a hard thing these days especially here in St Louis 'cause we have no film commission you know out of you know and and there's two shows on TV that are based in Missouri Ozark and sharp objects both filmed\nIn Georgia that's embarrassing to me and we talked about that and there there's a reason because we don't offer anything yeah and we don't\nThey don't understand that by helping\nA productions come to St Louis what you do is you promote otherwise an industry that Iran didn't just sending money back to how I got tons of people that are making commercials that are doing videos didn't work other states wouldn't be doing that and continue to do with judges doing it\nIt would just be on it and say glee vaguely yeah huge yeah fewer ... day you know almost everything out of cartoon network is made in\nGeorgia, Georgia all of it I mean every every show on uh on on NBC is based\nIn Chicago the Chicago fire there Chicago la Chicago veterinarians or Chicago is all that stuff and my favorite Chicago ... fried salad yeah which is a that was a I didn't go to that [laughter] actually had something going on they had a dream yeah yeah so\nWhat else do you when you get back home and you're not on the road what do you like to do here in town or a sports fan I Do I Do love sports and uh right now ... you know that's all you can do 'cause the cardinals aren't in its north county Catholic Boy you must play soccer I did ...\n[laughter] [laughter] I\nI just I just read I just got back in time I saw I read or doing that whole thing again well you know another\nUs that would be kinda every what year every two years I used to be now that we actually are getting a an aquarium it used to be every soccer in an aquarium\nWe ate the day it was usually was we're going to build an aquarium and like yeah yeah yeah but then then it was a soccer team but who knows us nothing better than an aquarium right in the middle of further further spot away from any\nOcean and possibly get I Can't wait for the aquarium because\nI how often they get to see catfish [laughter] what's that hunting it as a crop uh anyway um but yeah\nThere's no reason why we shouldn't have a soccer team here we have such a rich history\nIn soccer of soccer in St Louis and we really do and I mean heck you know the the misery athletic club gives out the award for best to do the best soccer player the year and everything it's just I don't get it I don't understand how we can not have a team here it would be

I'm Still with us she ... she says\nAndy I'm not good at this I don't know she's Seventy something okay anyway um so that's kinda cool right right right great here's the weird part of that that makes this a weird for me has just birthday\n[noise] oh so that makes it a very weird kind of you it's like this weird bitter sweet odd you know that's not even be stranger to me is that you know his birthday\nI have a really good memory OCD in my brain processes information in a very specific way\nYou know you knew the person that I read it so it was so you knew who he was a kid\nI was in ... Arizona relationship yeah right [noise] um and I I tend to remember numbers and dates really really well and that's just one of them it's kind of\nHard to forget that considering the fact is my grandmother's birthday or I don't necessarily know every date of every person I've ever dated birthday\nBut considering who he was and the connection to the grandmother's birthday I think that just solidified it in my brain because he would also use that as a manipulative tactic as a sort of like well you're meant to be with me 'cause I have your grandmother's birthday like I knew how crazy that sound to say it out loud but sixteen year old me didn't necessarily know that that wasn't\nTrue when I asked you know I was dating a twenty year old girl okay and she had the same birthday as well we had the same birthday interesting warriors part oh interesting okay All right me and my girlfriend December\nThe ... year though are different year okay that's cool though you are younger or older she's older than you know four years old or no to though you do\nHave my girlfriend is exactly her birthday that like a one week after mine were both the same astrological sign not that I give that much credence all the time but I think that's kind of interesting so it's just it's like October is a weird\nWeird mind because you've got my mom and dad's birthday both in October also and then you got the actual anniversary of the assault that happened to me is next friday\nSo it's a lot of them are in my time to you know and that's the reason I talk about as openly as I Do somebody reach out to me recently and was like you really do just kind of own it and I'm like you haven't always been that way it it got to a point where I was like you know what if I talk about it\nAnd I give voice to it it doesn't have as much power over my my cognition and over my thought processes which isn't much happier place to live so that sort of the reason I put it out there it's 'cause I Want other people to see that it it doesn't have to control their lives that they do have power over\nWhat what has happened to them and their and their experiences interesting notes or what you are you do\nIn mind I forget what the numbers were but a significant number of men that ran into her rather than\nLike 'cause she she said she was like I'm not going to do the thing where I bow out I Wanna see like well the other person like she played chicken basically\nBut I don't know so that being said yes I think that there are definitely\nA lot of societal or what's the word expectations ideas around what the male role is and what the female role is in relationship dynamics\nI sometimes argue that some of those things don't do us a lot of service and the positive direction we want to move things sort of like that\nEquality in relationships and looking for less of the division of you know I'm Better at this and you are this is my thing you can't do it I think we're seeing a shift you on that but\nCan we have some things aside okay you go to the guy can have that thing I mean it's not a bad thing and it's a bad thing I think it did you\nGo in the room first you get cooler first or higher warmer first and you get the longer\nI think this is where it really comes down to what are the individual relationship dynamic needs and what I mean by that is that you may be in a relationship with someone where you do need a certain amount of the ...\nThere might be other people that would go no I Want absolutely none of that and so I'm going to go into a completely opposite direction I think as long as you're having those conversations in the relationship about what it is that you stand for and what you're needing that's okay but I think yeah it it it's a kind of an individual decision at that point\nMaybe I'm so old that I just wouldn't know necessarily how we're food to to find somebody that was just that\nAre opposed to um you know holding of doors are picking up the check for it all the kind of the other thing opening the car door mhm I'm Mark uses in his day tomorrow night is going to slide the trek across the table and fix it a little holder said\nOn the day it's not during the ... things do later that night with friends watching football ... map the new day okay keeping it blitz about right [laughter] right I Will say though I think that here's why it matter what happens\nIf she ah she asked for something to drink like a bottle of water what are you gonna do ...\nFound somewhere [laughter] oh boy see alright there'll be merging usually worry and I'm just saying I ended up ... okay okay\nUm I Do think that it is okay for a man to say I want to be in a relationship with someone that wants me or will let me open doors and pay the check and you know whatever that may look like\nI also think it is okay for someone to say I do not want to be in a relationship with someone that always pays the checker always hold the door open I Want to do things myself again it it there's not one right answer because there's not\nIn myself again it it there's not one right answer because there's not one carbon copy a people it's like we're all different we're not carbon copies of each other so we have to figure out\nWho is going to match what we're meeting in that way which is why it's important on a date if you're sitting there talking to like maybe a heterosexual woman in the situation\nIf you're sitting there and you're you have the expectation that you're going to split the check or you know you're going to pay or whatever the check comes out and he grabs it well that would be a moment to go oh no I'd like to you know I'd like to pay my half or I'd like to you know I'd like to give you some money or or\nWhatever that tells me what to do this when the check comes out runners third day yeah I'll check comes out today okay ... comes out and she says I Would like to pay half that you know what it says to me what one lonely night ahead of me okay there's no chance she is buying\nHer ... boy now we've got to go into that because that's the whole thing is paying are way out and she used the line is really evening okay\nAnd that may be but here's what's interesting because someone allow old demand to pay for dinner that does not guarantee sex nor should it\nBe a core I and I agree a hundred percent but what I'm telling you is this you have to check that just says are I better get on my cell phone and started making plans with my buddy or something\nThat has all kinds of problematic thinking because where that is that is perpetuating the problem that we're trying to undo because what that's doing is it's basically saying the only good that a woman has to you on a date is to go home with you know\nOh no no I didn't get it may seem not just the sex that she is buying the date isn't going well she's barring the early ...\nI get what you're saying I misunderstood you okay yeah yeah that could be misunderstood you yeah there are also could be that but that's where it really comes down to being able to sort of again at least have some conversation I mean you're you're on a first date or second date or whatever it is you're going to have some conversations about these things 'cause that's what you talk about I mean\nWho pays for this and when you know that's just that's part of it now I'm Glad\nThat was with somebody you've been friends for like coke for years and she started dating how would that go what do you mean these people like\nWell you know going to do that\nI Would argue that there is even more of a reason then to go out of your way to be maybe more more like to have some distinguishing rerun that it's not just a friendship that it was and now it's a friendship and we have sex like that's not really solving anything that's just that's just kind of continuing and I actually I've had I've\nHad people make it to my office that it's kind of started relationships that way and it's not that it can't work or that it doesn't work but you want to be aware of the ...\nSome people are are can argue that it works better that way it started our friends\nOh you know I'm not saying it doesn't show up as friends what I'm saying is is that if you start as friends especially a longterm friendship and then you transition that into a relationship you are going to want your behavior to act more like now you're in a relationship not just a friendship that you have sex with someone else is a\nProblem I have to start Jay the problem is only my show the problem I was just as soon as more of the women's by that they don't want to dive into relationships with their guy friends because they don't want to jeopardize the friendship\nYeah because here here's what's interesting about that is that\nThis thing that makes you compatible as\nA relationship is that there is some underlying friendship that's there and I think that is actually kind of a valid fear because it is something that says\nWell I don't want to lose you but at the same time I kind of want this other thing with you and so I think there's a lot of evaluation that goes into that\nAnd sort of ... of that whole process because you don't want to give you know it's hard to find people that really get us especially like friends you know that like our on our side there like in our corner\nIf we look at the prospect of potentially losing that that's very scary and daunting it and never hurts to just try it never hurts you just try but I think that's where we have to make sure that we've got two people that are openly honestly communicating about what they\nWant and what they need because if you go into it knowing that both people in the friendship know that this could go south and we don't want to lose each other and we have a conversation about that\nIt makes it a lot more likely to occur if we're sort of putting it out there and making something we're focusing on\nJay ... we have a text for the three one for ... going back to the stairs going goes up first among such significant other you watch your feet going up the stairs so and you know\nAgree with that and that and I'm not saying I'm going wow you know right in

about in terms of manners and how to treat women yes or no yes good sex does ruin a friendship\nNot necessarily be just you know\nAnd there's not a yes or no to that not necessarily okay\nHum and should you remarry your ex\nGeneral my answer is no there are more in our two instances that I Know of and just like my personal life that I've I've been aware of that has worked\nAnd generally does that and here's the reason the thing that broke you up the first time is most likely going to be the thing that breaks you up the second time unless it was something like\nIn the cages I'm Talking about somebody had like a major drug or alcohol problem and they got that taken care of and they were able to come back together so I'm not going to say couldn't happen but it's not really my

scared of so I Do think it has gotten at least at least in that regard easier but I'd say quotes around easier because I don't know that it's really easier just to science ally might be easier the internal stuff is still\nThere is what I'm trying to think Jeremy ask you this about uh you know pride day pride parade okay\nThey seemed to me and maybe I'm stereotyping here maybe I'm just watching but it seems to be many of the over the top ... is is that just because they want to put on a good parade and the dull boring kind of just a regular go to work on a gay person just walking in the parade would be no fun\nI think it's that I mean it could be that on some level but I think it's that\nI I think it has a variety of reasons I think part of it is that it is a time where people feel completely free in that community to express themselves openly in a format that maybe they\nOrdinarily wouldn't feel quite so empowered or comfortable doing so I think it does kind of like you know that like let your hair down kind of I oh yeah\nYeah is there is some of that and it's also a celebration you had to keep that in mind that it is a celebration for those people that are in the parade there watching the parade so there there's going to be more of that almost like carnival type\nYou know they're having a blast the nightmare is not as though I'd avoided them saying I'm not going to

Louis and there really is a good community of people in support here so\nYou know but nationwide I Want people to know they're not alone absolutely\nAnd finally as we're wrapping up mental health awareness month it\nIs yes and I think actually mental health awareness day was last week some day but I'm just you know I feel like recently we had\nA lot of you know we talked about this on the show before just a lot of things and a lot of negativity and a lot of sort of everybody up in arms about things not just from like a political perspective but just sort of a societal perspective and I think it's important to remember that\nA lot of people in our community in our world they have their own struggles that may not always the mental health but I Do think it's important to bring awareness to the fact that just like if you told me you had diabetes and you needed to you know have certain treatment for for that\nI think it's important for the for the I guess the larger society to understand that and mental concerns mental issues that they are no different yeah they have treatment that is required they have certain protocol that needs to be followed but the mental concerns of a person should not be looked at as less than a physical one\nAnd there is a problem and I will tell you this if I had mental illness which may or may not I'm not going to tell you but if I did\nYou what do you tell you because then I Would be looked about a good until my clients because then I Would be looked down upon couldn't tell my congregation because then I Would be looked down upon right into I if I had which I don't\nUh would be right in the middle of nowhere to turn because I'm looked down upon exactly and I'm supposed to be the leader then that person itself which\nIs why I Try to remind people that are asking for help specifically from a mental perspective is actually a sign of strength not weakness I really had to do so much to overcome in that whole list that you just get rid of all the people that would be disappointed or let down or whatever\nI and I look at a man of the the politician and I'm biking completely or the ran for Senate and then was running for Kansas City mayor and what did the uh how do I do know Josh or a\nTender yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah coming out and saying I Need help for ... yeah\nUm are give him so much credit for doing that because I Do to do that as a position that political position where you know you could run through the whole it'd be that I just ran through that I didn't do any of these people and I certainly can't announce it right goes my political career be over to say\nYou know what I'm going to announce it and I don't think my political careers over is a good thing\nI Do too and I honestly think that that is the thing that we need more up we need more people to vote on really share authentically who they are and not steal like they have to hide it for fear of what might happen repercussion wise like we should not be you know no more than we would get mad at a politician for having diabetes\nYeah absolutely yeah that is Lindsay Walt and this has been all access after dark it's always a pleasure I
