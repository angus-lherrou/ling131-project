a guy Phillips on tape we we're we're gonna talk a little bit about that and I'm Glad we have you in the studio because you've been following it and talked about it on the show the big sports show\nA St Louis looks like it's back in the soccer game and the thing that I Love about this one um that I didn't love so much about the last go round was\nNo um public funding for the stadium\nAnd again I'm not opposed to public funding for things I'm necessarily but when it comes to\nA public funding for stadiums that I'm a lots of other cities are building themselves\nAnd when we have schools that are falling apart and roads that are falling apart and and just you know the homeless living on the streets it it hurts me to see you know that kind of money being spent\nOn sports projects that that really can be built by the people that own the teams and and they make\nMoney at this um and and we can help them along and I think this new proposal meets the best of both worlds in that regard so we are going to talk a little bit about that I'm very happy love soccer and and and glad that you know we might get an MLS team here that's spectacular\nIt's fascinating how does just came out it was just out of the blue I mean you didn't hear any chatter about it when we heard a couple of weeks ago with the um the development stuff that we might be getting an analyst team but this one just seemed like it was out of the blue and no one really knew seemed to know well I don't know\nBut this this came out of the blue and Nikki Haley resigned as UN ambassador out of a nude added the that's why she's resigning ad out of the blue ... coincidence I don't think so maybe Nikki Haley as bringing the MLS team to St Louis will have to see um\n... yeah it did just again but there are\nA number of folks in this town and we talked about this Charlie barns that I a little bit talking about who the people left in this town where ... you know Twenty years ago we had some leaders in this town\nThat they'd often stepped up to the plate and we still have them now but they're not as noticeable their dad is out front and they're not as prevalent maybe in large part because we don't have as many\nOf those um big companies here you had August Bush when that was here when a McDonald Douglas was here you had the the the McDonald's family up there were lots of examples like that the merits family when merits was really a big deal and a lot of those now or I mean those people\nMerits was really a big deal and a lot of those now or I mean those people are there but those companies are caught but when it comes to St Louis right now\nI Would say there is no family a greater than uh the Taylor family in terms of what they do day in day out of enterprise is a spectacular company so that's what they built this a car rental company up into this entire\nUm ... billion dollar company a corporation that does all kinds of things\nBut they've never forgotten about St Louis you can see their mark all over town and not in the way that I'm as some others have done it and they uh yeah yeah the Taylors you'll see their names but they\n[noise] I don't have any problem with guys like Mark Cuban and Jerry Jones in no no no no no no what am I saying in in all the guys and even stand cranky ... you know\nI'm On it with reservations that you don't make money that they have invested in and build up now stand trunk you went to LA and and just Jenna took advantage of the city up there and a whole bunch of other stuff but if you build up the city if you\nBuild your stadium you build your team and you're making a zillion dollars as a result of that\nIn school and it's all about so you know that's the way I look at it I Hope this is a tremendous up now the truth is most most sports teams [noise]\nUm they you know you'd be surprised these guys aren't getting rich off that they do on the appreciation is like toys that get passed around but I don't believe that at the end of the day for the most part a lot of these sports teams\nI'm pulling a lot of money they could do a lot better I guess is the way to put it that if they invested in something else other than a sports team\nBut when you're rich and you get lots of money to spend and only a few things out there that are worth buying there you go we have ...

particular kind of job\nAnd especially when those jobs were concentrated in particular area those people get hurt and we ought to care very much about what's happening with them and about their lives\nUm probably the best way to address that\nIs not by eliminating people opportunities to engage in commerce with whoever they wish no matter where they live out in the world it's to better care for one another to provide better education so that when people get hit by these kinds of shocks\nThey can adjust and they can adapt\nTo we're speaking with professor Bonnie Wilson associate professor of economics at St Louis university professor Wilson\nThere are some things that I think\nSome would say are positive changes in the new agreement one thing I didn't know was the candidate was very protective of their dairy industry and so it kind of opens up a little bit um and again I\nFor people that are in the mid west in Wisconsin the cheeses and the other's up there I mean that's a big deal crossing the border\nAnd there was also and I read something about cars have to be manufactured by people a certain percentage by people making a wage of the gene or sixteen dollars an hour which would make them more competitive or make the United states more competitive with those countries\nRight on the dairy question so while people are staying largely what the new agreement has done it had some regulation on the dairy it is a freeing up of trade\nIs that going to have a big effect for most of us probably not because the dairy trade between the United states and Canada it's quite small\nOne of the um the goods in which trade was freed up there it's actually the larger Canadian\nI'm Gary folks were in favor of bringing that up as well so um yeah there is more free it's a small potatoes and the grand scheme of things that unless you're a dairy farmer and then it's helpful now on um automobiles so\nThere are a rule of origin requirements so the new rule of origin requirements look fairly dramatic\nSo as I understand it roughly Seventy five percent\nOf any automobile will have to have been produced inside North America in order for that auto to move across borders Tara free Seventy five percent has to be produced in North America that sounds like a big number it is a big number but here's the thing\nThe rule of origin requirement had Ben at about sixty two and a half percent\nFor well over a decade right um I've seen many analyses of how much this will of origin requirement is going to affect things I've seen some claims that there is actually only three Mexican made cars that will be effective\nAffected 'em but I've seen another source that indicates about thirty percent of cars made in Mexico wouldn't meet the rule [noise]\nThe other thing you mentioned the sixteen dollar minimum wage regulation um strikes me as a little more interesting so if I understand it some forty forty five percent of the content of an automobile\nHalf to come from factory that pay sixteen at least sixteen dollars an hour so that is basically a continent wide minimum wage and the automobile industry\nWhich is interesting here is\nThe thing there is an interesting question scares me I got a tickle in my brother or whether\nThis actually could discourage automakers from making cars in North America\nYet that was my point don't you just ship them back over to Asia or South America I'm\nProbably so if your car is made outside of North America when it comes to North ... well it when it comes in to the United states are care operate on everybody else is two and a half percent\nWith relatively low so it's conceivable that it would be cheaper for some auto makers to move their production outside of North America and be subject to the two and a half\nPercent Harris and to pay the new minimum wage right so that's going to be interesting to see of course at that begins to happen on it may well be that the Trump Administration will increase that tariff rates\nRight and and that's I think we're all comes down to this is it is always moving parts now this was negotiated among the folks and they do it the negotiation for their various countries but it's still a long way from going into law correct\nYeah so what comes next is is there will be consultation with the private sector and Congress and the United states for about sixty days and that will happen in Canada and Mexico with\nTheir respective private sectors and um government\nSo there could be some tinkering around the edges there and then the parties will sign in late November and then comes the ratification process he is in each of their respective countries so probably we can expect in spring twenty ninth team\nAn up or down vote on this in Congress and then if there's an up wrote it would take effect in twenty twenty\nSo Professor Bonnie Wilson I Want you to characterize the new United States Mexico Canada agreement as a pro free trade or anti free trade and only those two choices were what box would you put it in\n[noise] relative to where we were\nIt's marginally worse from an economic perspective a relative to where we were it's marginally anti free trade\nWe do at least now have an agreement and hopefully that will eliminate a lot of the uncertainty that people have been dealing with\nAnd that uncertainty can be very problematic with respect to international trade so ah there's then all of this bluster and rhetoric if that will now and and calmed down that's a very good thing and hopefully we'll be able to move forward\nThere you go all you need to know about the new United States and Mexico Canada agreement which is looking to replace NAFTA United States Marine Corps agreement\nAssociate professor of economics in St Louis university Bonnie Wilson

an FBI undercover agent\nIs just released Michael was an undercover agent for many years very few FBI agents working undercover even\nFewer work undercover often almost no one has worked as much undercover as Michael McGough in his book chronicles his work as an undercover agent everything up to work with El Chapo himself and the ... cartel thank you for joining us thank you for having major\nHow did you become an FBI undercover agent how do you get started\nWell in my case uh when I first got him interested in working undercover there was no formalized process within the FBI today it's very structured process for back in the late eighties there was no\nFormal process\nSo a lot of times undercover agents had previously come from a law enforcement background which I had I was a police officer prior to join in the FBI and that's how I got started and\nThere was no official training as I said the training that we learn that at that time was basically on the job or on the street training\nThe I've thought about this many many times and it was kind of one of my things that I wanted to be a an FBI agent and for various reasons that didn't work out I Am a lawyer and that that was one path that I thought about it but the whole notion of undercover work\nUm fascinates me and scares me to death the thought of being out there undercover and and being discovered what makes it good undercover agent\n[noise] what makes a good undercover agents that it took many many many years to learn this when I first started I was horrible\nThat first I'd\nBe the first to admit that it's a very difficult assignment because just think it through logically you spend your entire lifetime trying to become an FBI agent staying on the straight and narrow\nAnd now you're being asked to operate in an environment in which you have to convince real bad guys that Joe is better or worse than they are right so psychologically\nIt's a it's a huge challenge um but as I've discovered over the years it was something that from day one I was fascinated as you just said I was always fascinated with it\nAnd it is a tradecraft that you can get better at if you work hard at your craft and that's what I Try to do over the years\nAnd every time you make a mistake or you learn from that so you don't make the same mistake again and\nThe the fortunately or unfortunately in my career it was a trial and error basis where I went out there and did what I thought I should do and learn from each to show the progressive later I got better the longer I did it\nFor their every instance as early on in your career where they said we know exactly who you are we're not interested\nWhen I first started I was assigned to purchase a drugs and I believe it was my first or second time where when I approached the suspect who said not tonight officer have a good\nThing that that must be a lesson that didn't go well that would now you\nSay you learn by trial and error learned on the job but sometimes you know it's not just oh I'm gonna learned my lesson you end up with a bullet in your head or or buried in a daring we'd be in the back of a trunk somewhere\nYeah I'm In more guts then I got Michael McGough in your book is goes by Thirty years as an FBI undercover agent it's available now last question for you and I\nAppreciate your time you're out you've written this book you have any concern that someone out there still has an axe to grind the you'll end up in a shallow harbor somewhere in the Boston area\nThat seems to me the most frequent question I don't know I don't\nAnd the reason is is what this was a reasonable I Want I face those guys in the street at the time\nWhich was probably the most dangerous time right then I face them in a courtroom or you know I Believe

I tried to watch the first suicide squad I just did not like it but that is a the franchise led by Will Smith Margot Robbie and Jared let out\nAt the tough to do because you it's not a D.C mine I guess you can say for James Gunn like if you look at the first suicide squad has not it does not like it could be a James Gunn movie for a sequel that to me yeah moving like it could be a mood for him\nOr we'll see so he's taking over that he left the guardians which was hugely popular monster asleep popular um now obviously a gala gala the guardian says going on it's a they don't use a script still too right they're going to use the script they're just not going to let him direct it\nUm but we'll see when you get money for that still for the script yeah it depends it's oftentimes you know what you negotiate sometimes ah the studios will just by your script outright and I don't know what a big studio what the going rate is ... it may be\nUm you know you're the Writers Guild of America and again I I think\nIt may be a minimum of Seventy five thousand for the script really yeah\nWow now that's kind of a minimum and then if you can always negotiate up from that if you're somebody who's really big and ... and so then you can negotiate a higher\nRate for the script you can negotiate for points that is okay a quarter of a million dollars for the script and I want one point which means I Want one percent of the growth on the back end\nOr a percentage of a point ... um the more popular the are you are the more talented you are the more of a franchise person you are are the better the deal or you will end up with\nAnd and so that's and then every time you add something else to the list of your credit so maybe you're going on as a producer as well there's another opportunity to make something the director this another opportunity\nI'm In a you know as as you start adding those numbers up on a big\nYou know half a billion dollar film you can start pulling in some some real money and my guess is uh James Gunn or at least by the second guardians of the galaxy\nAnd it pretty sweet deal are going for him so All right it's nine or ten forty six to this is all access which can so we're going to take a break we'll be right back\nBad is nothing like the realm of your favorite on trade cooking outside on the grill Franklin from showers hardware here to tell you we have a grill the picture now are you a fan of the classic charcoal cattle\nWhoever cattle has been a favorite for generations or if you prefer the ease of gas Weber genesis has an unreliable weren't looking for food so full of smoking goodness your guests will make you work all day on frankly who is easier than a gas grill mothers put a smoking brothers pellet grill on your patio or ... or apps you enjoy the primeval ritual\n...
