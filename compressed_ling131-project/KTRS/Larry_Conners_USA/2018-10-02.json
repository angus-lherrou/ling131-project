down and check it out because it's a historical beautiful mansion\nThat everything has been restored to in St Louis it's kind of a gym that not a ton of people know about them\nBut they're having a ... they had an anniversary party this year and one of their original recipes from Mrs Campbell was a Roman punch and it was a beverage that they used to drink made with egg whites and\nExcuse me and champagne and cherry an orange really it was delicious animals so we wanted to collaborate\nAnd so I looked at the recipe books and I said I'm going to try to make this room and punch in to a survey and that we did and so now they're going to be selling this holiday season and ... percent of the proceeds will go back to the Campbell house\nUm and and they're going to have it at the museum so they can kind of show it off to all their visitors that come through to ... there\nCan I get drunk off of the snow\nI said my wife was picture of this she says she wants to the gallon [laughter] so what because often you hear that when you put alcohol into the food and the wine into the food that through the cooking process that then burns off the alcohol so they say but ah uses frozen so it's not burning off anything\nNo and we have we have our trade secret process for infusing alcohol into ice cream much to what is it per cent what is the secret [noise] I'd have to kill ya okay [laughter]\nBut um so you can't really tell you but they are pretty busy depending on the flavors of this is a store base of this is around ten to twelve percent [noise] um I Would say if I ate a gallon could I get drunk\nYou might try their problem [laughter] that's right [laughter] I probably wrote toilet paper I got you know Howard seems to be like you can try and go but\nYou know that ah the one demand dang go [laughter] travel troubled hunting thing I think you know what would top it off a few books bacon\nOh that's interesting\nThat we're doing it all ... all the all access

you just deliver attempt to carry on a ... do you know how to make all these or you have a we you know creative people back there in white lab coats that are doing this for you\nSo I'm actually I have traditionally done all of my flavors and recently I have acquired a secret weapon on her name is Erica Parker um\nWho are we recruited her from another ice cream company in the mid west and so now she's helping there's a lot of the R and D as I as we open more stores I get really busy so she's kind of my right hand I I kind of say\nGoes you can do this and she comes and goes and makes her magic and comes back and like yeah let's do this let's tweak this oh gosh so I I Do have a partner in crime now\nYou're located in Clayton offered him on Lafayette square which is where's that store\nThat

place in town\nThat I'm also has their ice creams in the stores and I will tell you it's not anywhere near as good when you buy it uh after it's been frozen for months or however long as it is when you go to the place live because\nCustard is not meant to be frozen or either later [laughter]\nAfter I did that all the way it's supposed\nTo eat and um so we actually have pretty much every grocery store in town has asked us for our pine ... and just strategically I've just decided to only sell them from the shops now I'm at some point we will um but for right now\nWe're going to come to us
