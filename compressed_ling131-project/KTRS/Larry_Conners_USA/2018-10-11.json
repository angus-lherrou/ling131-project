David required the voter to swear they do not possess a form of personal identification of proof for voting\nWhile simultaneously presenting the election authority a form of personal identification bet is approved\nSo really there's no I mean if you\nOften what they do in these cases where if you're not registered you think you're registered in one place but you show up in the wrong place or you don't have a a proper ID you can\nA cast what is called a provisional ballot\nAnd that is they'll take you off to the side they will say here is a an envelope\nI'm here's some information you're going to fill it out we're going to be confirmed that this is you or somehow that um that everything's okay but it's in a provisional ballot and it will only count if everything is correct and sometimes the the paperwork that they require is an affidavit and\nAnd then you can go back to the records oftentimes the provisional ballots\nAren't necessarily even counted because if you only have if one side wins by you know ten thousand and you have fifty provisional ballots than it it doesn't matter doesn't mean your vote doesn't count\n'em but ah it is provisional upon checking so here what they're saying is and the judge said no that's misleading you can't have that\nUm and uh the secretary of state's office is going to up appealed that ruling now is today was the last day for voter registration um now that everyone's registered I encourage everyone to get out and vote but I Do think it's important\nFor people to know what it is they should bring it to the voting booth the ballot this year is an nobody should be um dissuaded from showing up but it's a long ballot we have lots of propositions on the ballot\nThe lines are going to be um probably a long at times because that turnout will be higher we have a lot of people very interested in these midterm elections I think the uh saint Charles uh election authority suggests that typically in mid term election will be\nThirty five percent turnout they're expecting in St Charles fifty percent\nI Wish it was a hundred percent but it's not but even at fifty percent with the long ballot\nIs going to be a long line so what you don't want to do is stand in a very long line only to get to the front of that line and be told that you don't have what it takes to\nUm you know the proper identification of the proper paperwork you can check you can go on line if you live in St Louis county you can go on the St Louis county board of election commissioners website you can find out everything you need to really very easy or you can call them um you can check\nI think on the website where you are voting who places remember sometimes they change when one year to ah you know for years and years and years I was at the same location while they were doing it was a school they were doing construction at the school\nAnd they um you know they said we can't we don't have the room for you we're we're doing construction in the gym and all this and I showed up at the gym because that's where I'd gone every and I had no idea I had to go home I'd asked around 'em so look just confirmed that you know your soap same location and then check to see\n'em what id what is necessary\nBecause um you know I nobody should be tempted to say and you know what I'm not waiting in line again\nOr just doesn't matter you know it does matter it matters for all the parties all the independence for everyone your vote matters this country relies upon I hate to sound like a you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Larry Conners USA", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "11"}
