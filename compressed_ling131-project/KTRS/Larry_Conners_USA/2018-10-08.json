knowing where whereabouts she points the finger at St Louis city law enforcement [noise] two\nHundred and forty four registered sex offenders cannot be accounted for the city of St Louis close to two hundred are considered the most dangerous type of registered sex offender\nThe auditors says that represents Nineteen percent of the sex offenders unaccounted for and the city of St Louis\nShe says that compares to two percent unaccounted for and St Charles county and one percent in St Louis county but I talked to the St Louis to the public safety director Jimmi Edwards who was office includes the police department\nPast the St Louis police department on down on the job at the auditor in Sydney\nWhich I don't think so uh this is a very complex a law or the numbers change daily\nSo that people move into our jurisdiction I think that that number is so fluid chanted suck to waste so much that it's almost impossible to say exactly how many sex offenders are within the city of St Louis\nSees how can we keep up with all these people while\nLegislators passed this law to have a public safety to all call there was a sex offender registry it is the job of law enforcement to

Arctic tough\nCouple of games to kick off the season we heard the coach saying he didn't like the Shani\nHockey explain that to folks and what was he saying well\nThat's like the or pick up back basketball version of hockey also known as summer hockey you know when you're still puck out there and you just play or you know you're not worried about playing defense now what about getting back now what about turning pops over and not worry about playing with any structure whatsoever and I think that's what he's talking about and usually that's when a head coach\nGets frustrated when you're playing with in the team concept you see a lot of our men Russians against me see what happened last night in Chicago given up a to a leader early and then a third period lead something we're not used to seeing the blues do traditionally\nLet's talk about Jake out I think all summer long\nHe owned it and he said listen I Know I Need to be about our need to make a big save every once in awhile\nTo games and the blues have given up ten roles every not all him they were real clear lesson literature single track pretty emphatic saying don't talk about Jake talk about this scene what have you seen so far far I\nFelt like this when I've had a three minute break down led to the basically the same getting out of hand there for St Louis Winnipeg taking over and\nUm you know check made some big saves to keep it you know the the booze a chance heading into the therapy here's one nothing game heading into the third but I think you're right you know you look at gold centered in the national hockey league nowadays it's not always about how many goals you give up its getting the time we say last night and overtime Jonathan teams with an overtime are keeping a breakaway goal\nYou typically don't blame the gold standard but again you're looking for that big a big moment and Jake well certainly need to do that for the blues especially if they continue to have those defensive breakdown so I think that's what you know you want out of your ... and of course the players are going to come to his defense because it's an entirely\nHis fault and getting Joel evidence and back in the lineup will certainly help he's not just one of the best defense on defence when Martin he's one of the best\nPlayers so we asked on Twitter questions for restriction Michael Nixon said I Hope I can still get this question and trying to help out Jake out how do you avoid [noise]\nCan you avoid some of those men Russian what are they doing wrong defensively that's leading to this well\nFirst off if you're a defense when you're trying to protect lead you can't get stuck deep in the office of zone wise to keep a third man high in the end the officers own to eliminate odd man Russia's coming back your way of managing the pocket not turning pops over putting pox him right areas\nIn in in in in spots where you're going to have ... support to eliminate\nThe opportunity for the other man or other team to come back down the other way where they have numbers against you and we saw that against Winnipeg\nSome of that was their own doing on special teams I mean the blues gave up a power play go ashore Hannibal and some even sprinkles as well in some of those were breakdowns and like the odd man Russia's then we saw that again in yesterday's game I'm against Chicago but it's also defending the front of the ... that was an area in last night's game Jonathan ... is a couple of his goals\nA prior to the overtime bowl Martin where it's one on one battles in front of outlets would translate the cat and he's got to be better better stick positioning a stronger stick in similar\nSituations where we did see of literature psycho score twice always seems to play really well when it's the Blackhawks he's got the new line this year we talk a lot about a rally in the middle and bathrooms or what have you seen from that\nGroup that you're starting to see them get better and better you know and they've been together since the very you know the first day of training camp and just getting the first full for him last night of course before too that's going to lead to more and more confidence in Iran or Riley is just been better than advertised for there's hockey team and then have ruined trying to find his way on that line I thought he was exceptional last night obviously it was\nA you know one of the best players on the ice for St Louis but going to take more than just this one line they need to get some balance going they're not getting that right now is Shannon short sign is really yet to get going on the case of terrorists go\nHe really hasn't had this type of plane making center to play with since he's come here to St Louis and that includes cost after cost asking was a really good center and don't get me wrong\nThey didn't play a ton of everybody played a lot together I should say um\nBut again a rally probably brings more dynamic off and some ability in terms of his plane making skills and uh so he can thrive playing with the center of my life that he always wanted somebody like a rally now we've got um a room brings a big heavy body on the other side we saw the for check\nLaying out Seabrook forcing the turnover and then a rally makes it nice pass to ah to terrorists ankles so again get used to terrorists Michael scoring assuming they stay together\nThe blue schedule this week there at home uh two more times this week interrupted by a trip to Chicago on Saturday it's Matthew could shocking calorie on Thursday night at enterprise center Saturday the rematch with the hawks up at the UC and then Sunday next Sunday night\nThe ducks are coming here so a real heavy serving of home games we knew that when the schedule came out I think that makes it a little harder to take the new because you're getting all these opportunities early to see the when at home\nYeah and that was an issue last year Martin they weren't winning enough on home lives and you could say well it's early in the season it doesn't matter but these games can always come back to bite you you want to put on a show\nEspecially in front of your home parents after all the hype and the off season bringing all the new players on board um do you want to take care of home ice especially when you have a lead in the third period you don't want to see the breakdown is that we've seen two games or else\nMaybe a reminder to the jets are really good people won't talk about it and maybe Chicago after finishing dead last last year he's a motivated club art pat burrow and you mentioned it with that first line it seemed like last night and maybe someone doesn't show up in the statutes but number seven last night I was just he may need from and what does that physical prowess\nWhile the Centre cowardly has kind of what he does he see here maybe he's a little angry there he didn't finish in the break away but again enforcing the turn over three using his big\nBody to create off as the chances for his line mates creates space for his line that's when he can do also very underrated skill I mean people are starting to see that being him just in terms of his ability to make plays with a park his hands when there aren't too many players and the national hockey league that have his brand of game Martin when you really watch 'em play and how he plays\nHis protection down low\nI mean for a big man he's kind of like ... you remember him back in the day from from Vancouver maybe not you know the numbers the tobacco up in all kinds of standpoint but again how he plays you don't see too many big men in the national hockey players\nGetting one of the best nicknames him or on the big rats MTC truck overtime they love you bye MTC\nIs a great name are a lot of young faces on this team Jordan Cairo people talk about the scoring touch scored yet what have you seen thirty for a while he hasn't\nPlayed a ton I think he played all nine minutes under ten minutes last night he's average just over eleven minutes the first two games do you go back to the pre season you know you saw him get an opportunity early and he really never slowed down and you may have been their best player in the ... he was an overall just in terms of how he played and you know just took off in the beginning\nBut again he's never played the national guard so they got to give him some time and that's also gained the trust\nOf the coaches specifically Mike yo he wants to be able to trust Jordan Cairo in in in situations that\nSaw yesterday when it's a close game and the third period whether you're up I've always trailing by ... um you know he wants to go to ... I think as a season progressed as you're going to see more of them and I'd like to see them getting power play time too I think gates\nThese and progress is you're going to see more of him\nAnd I like to see him getting power play time too I think given some time and space is described in school and the national hockey league five on five it's going to be an adjustment going from the only child of the national hockey league but this guy put up big numbers were reason he is super super talented and you're going to see him get a job\nAre centered around a long time listener first time caller Dan McLaughlin waiting and he said if you have strict there somebody says Dr donut has a different story [laughter] any Mac what Janelle Machado or Harper or the cardinals are they gonna goal and what are what your gut here\nWell you know my staff is telling me it's probably not going to happen in terms of St Louis and we like to see her again here right but that's probably unlikely I mean they might sources are telling me teams like the Yankees may have interest Chicago you know about it is yeah okay those teams typically find their way in terms of getting their hands on\nThose ... they're never
