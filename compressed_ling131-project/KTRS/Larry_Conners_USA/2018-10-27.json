that they have the right guy they seem to think they have the right guy or it puts all of the uh the conversation from last night to rest\nThe Democrats\nPut it together a discussion that goes away yeah um did you see is van they the guys van yeah with all the Trump [laughter] now let's let me be clear here as I say um [noise] I couldn't believe for a second that\nI'm ... that the Democrats quite frankly had anything to do with this I also still believe and this is going to play itself out this guy is a mentally ill or there is no doubt in my mind anybody that would even consider doing something like this is mentally ill\nHas nothing to do with that and I think it can uh I think it would flip me out if I had as thin as some of the things that they do I like I could probably do the snakes on me that's\nNot a big asteroid I can I picked up snakes that I've had snakes wrapped around me and so and that's ... that's fine I'm not a big fan of the water modest income and downstream toward me I'm not a big fan of uh you know playing around with a poisonous snakes like the snake ... or whatever those guys are the snake is you know the guys at handling of the ...\n[laughter] and I think as the religious guys that they I Know I Know not a big fan of that um\nWhat do you ... what do you think about the just this kind of off on the side but what do you think about the ministry where they use the snake charmer ...\nSo ... uh one first of all I'm never going to necessarily you know suggest to anyone that their way of practicing religion is crazy short of\nIt causing serious harm to themselves or others and there have been bad so that was number one number two is the whole idea is that God's going to\nTake care of you and yet we see time and time and time again\nPeople that are practicing this dying from state bites ... now I think others will say well apparently they didn't have enough faith know nearly for more than I Am yeah and so that's I again I I guess I Would criticize it when it hurts themselves or others I I just I\nI'm I'm not a fan of that I'm not quite sure I've never understood I I Know where the theological foundation is it's never been one that I thought oh yeah yeah that's important\nThat's one I can grab hold of I mean I've watched them and I've even watch the\nDocumentaries they have on TV and it's it surprises the hell out of me as

I\n... as you once you get to an adult then you have absolutely every right in the world to act accordingly you get to choose and I believe that people have the right to choose to deliver die [noise]\nUm I really bothers me when I see sometimes the kids yeah um because they haven't had the opportunity and um without offending anyone I I mean no offense but\nUm you know we we always say God will provide yeah he provided for doctors and he provided for all kinds of knowledge and so you don't die right it is and the plants and the and that's and different things that we make 'em medicines out of and\nUm you know I think God's right in there with us so I'm against that\nBut if you choose to do that but just with the kids that always hurts a little bit because you know I look at that kid

forever for no no no no I think that's what I mean that's the way of giving away of I mean even the way the law now you're a philosopher\nBank alright check it out let's say let's take race out of this and let's flip it so sometimes people need analogies let's say a a guy a guy or\nWas abusive to his wife and just abuse of over the years over the years over the years and decided he was not going to be abusive to his wife anymore I just stopped but he never said look I'm I'm Sorry\nFor abusing use and that he just gradually stop beating there but\nHe's still ... still treated or wrong but never abused dirt and eventually at the age of fifty sixty years though may be searched treating her with a little respect do you think that that woman\nIs like yeah I Am so happy in this relationship or do you think she holds emotional baggage\nI see where you go on and she holds the emotional baggage ... so way I'm saying is way like eventually there was no slavery eventually we didn't have to ride it back to the bus but when is this country ever say shell oil we\nDid to you was really messed up what can we do to make things better it's just this is just basic people to Munich Casey treating people rice skills you can stop doing something\nBut you can't expect people they always say just apologize people always want closure there was never any ratio closure and it was like four hundred years of treating people like this is that like what we\nWas fifty years ago fifty years ago who couldn't ride in the back of the bus so it during my lifetime right you're like whoa hey\nWe're okay when I was saying and that was ready to go over it but no that's not a natural it's not a natural thing to get over it so whatever it is whatever you feel I don't like I'm not\nLike I Can't waste that negative energy like I just teach my kids like do you get pulled over you just got to be smart\nAnd yeah I hate to tell you live in a suburb yeah as soon as I moved to the

changer here let me because I don't want to turn it into your comedian you're here to make people laugh but this is very interesting I I like your your your analysis I really do your analogy\nBut you you brought it up about the kids what do you tell your kids I mean you're living in the suburbs you um you are not a living in the ... you are a professional yeah now what do you tell your kids when it comes to um ... their place in in this world that we live in today\nOr what I was the first day it's ground one night I tried to teach them about the\nN word and the history of ... and I tell them that uh it was a word that uh that makes people uncomfortable but it was also were that was forced in vocabulary it was it was literally for us\nThat was forced in vocabulary it was it was literally for ...\nAnd we didn't get like hey we're [noise]\nWe let you go you're no longer slaves and in there and black people like we did more to fly like it was forced enough vocabulary so when people like you can't say that word you can't like you can't do that like it's an uncomfortable thing but I tell them I'd go\nYou have to do if you're going to use that word I'm not telling you to use their I don't use it like that as your call\nWhether how you use that word you have to deal with the repercussions of it if you use that were around your white friends and your wife ... says if you have to deal with the repercussions of it I treat they were much like white people treat defined\nChina [laughter] I only bring it around my close friends [laughter]\nGet out of friends who are\nThat's right I don't use it around like sometimes I use in and jokes\nBut it was very like I don't see any transitions I'm not saying that just to say\nA lot of comedies do that so now I just say you have to deal with the repercussions on it and if you want to say that word and you put him in your music and this and that\nYou want to sell albums you want to be mainstream but you don't want people to sing the lyrics that's not natural ... like I like like I Believe in hold myself I don't it's not natural to say\nYou treat people a certain way you don't apologize and you want things to just disappear is not ... it's also not natural\nFor the you want now want people to say the N word and you put in ... and you want people to buy the albums but then you don't want them to say the word\nIt's just you can't have both so I'm trying to get to the point where I don't let that were have that much power over me mhm\nBut then again I Know when people say that word to me negatively they are saying that it's like spending in my face ... like there's hate involved in it it's it's it's different so it's like yeah\nLike what do you do it's it's like nothing is perfect you try to be the best the best person you can be but there's a lot of awful people out there and then you got to survive I didn't have the game when ... when are we getting\nOut of the electric car gross you got some baby\nYou know that's

minds a creepy crawly things is the St Louis ... it'd be blue in the zoo was going on now through Halloween\nAnd so we thought it would be interesting to bring in someone who oversees the decree peace in the ... the things that we kinda shiver a little bit when we see Dr ... is the curator\nOf invertebrates and he is the director for the center of native pollinators conservation and one of the great things about the St Louis zoo is the insect carry him and a doctor a speed ... works as part of the zoo in the insect Terry I'm welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so let's start I'm just what the definition of invertebrates\nInvertebrates are those animals are technically without backed by so vertebrates are the mammals birds reptiles amphibians fish\nI'm at a few other smaller groups which most people don't see it birth or most of life on the planet those things actually keep them a planet running those things which we cannot live without\n[noise] I guess to go all the way to the single ... are they invertebrates or if I go out to starting\nYeah technically you know they're not in verb it's ever ever so I'd have to be multi cellular okay maybe that they have more than one cell so ... means damn ... are not really regarded as invertebrate\nStill would I say spiders and bugs you does does that coverage gentle\nSpider insects slugs worm\nCorals a ... a jellyfish all those sorts\nOf things [laughter] All right so a lot of those can be found in the insect carry them down there at a at the zoo a really cool place um and I encourage everyone to get down there to kind of place where you are I don't want to see insects know you want to see these insects how long has that been there and describe it a little bit [noise]\nSo we've actually opened around two thousand so we're next year will be our nineteenth beer and existence um we're actually rather unique because most lose do not exhibited vertebrates the way we do or they may have a couple of here and there we actually have a dedicated ... average staff [noise]\nSo we're actually one of the ... and the country which has a dedicated building staff\nOr education conservation and research effort is devoted to invertebrates so\nSt Louis who is unique that's another reason why you want to kind of come um and the the St Louis do because we are one of the few out there\nAnd then I said this before in the show in segments on the zoo in otherwise when you count on one hand the things that make St Louis grade the St Louis zoo was one of them for many many reasons and as you just described this to do is is unique enhanced things that you won't find nearly anywhere else in the world\nUm we're speaking with ... curator of invertebrates tell us a little bit about some of the let's start with the Halloween e creepy crawly I Know you have some cockroaches down there that I've seen their gas they looked like maybe I'm exaggerating but the sides of football's\nWell that is a bit actually that's\nActually very common with various fares so often times you know people call up and say oh I've seen those cock roaches used as a ... foot\n... of spider the size of a softball\nUm we don't have those things around here but fear tends to inflate it I remember as a kid I remember saying I remember this patron at a three foot\nWingspan well they don't but that was just a little bit of a fear when I was a show\nSo we have a ... lot of different types of ever see the number of different types of spiders that we have on exhibit from ... some of those actually being threatened in the wall like the red meat translate from Mexico to those that we actually might find around here like the brown reckless we always try to maintain a brown recluse on exist\nWealth and doesn't touch the mosquito is not going to do anything right but you also have to think about the other bees\nButterflies other beneficial insects which can be affected by those same insecticides\nIt's far more effective look at where those mosquitoes are laying their eggs so it's understanding their life cycle so we need to understand more and more about these species how they live and that's going to be much more effective at dealing with if we have issues with control\nBut right now we're saying\nWhich some people are calling and infect apocalypse that insects are disappearing studies done in Europe and studies done here in the U.S are finding many insect populations are decreasing of paper just came out looking at the rain forest\nSpecies they're also declining and then those species would treat on them are declining whether it be amphibians birds et cetera so we're seeing things which um is changing drastically our ecosystem and we rely very heavily on all these and verb it's as I said from the beginning\nThey're the ones keeping the plight of running so whether they're pollinating our food pollinating or the food for other animals whether they're cleaning up whether they are the food for other animals to keep them alive\nAll of that as an connected and as we started pulling on each of these different strings or the ... of these in a relationship Web before pulling out the reverse of a plane\nWe're going to see problems which we may not have even thought about\nWe are talking with Dr ... he is the curator of invertebrates and the director for the center of native pollinators conservation at the St Louis do\nLet me ask you this when my daughter calls me up and says there's a spider in my room I think oftentimes our first\nReaction is is killing or there's another bugs or there's another insect is it OK to kill a spider\nUm for me I actually just catch him and put them up so high and my wife used to be very afraid of spiders or she's gotten over most of her fears and for something like the jumping spiders she now finds\nThem to do that but if there is a spider\nWe find in the house for most other species they've kind of inadvertently got in the house I wandered into that yeah so they actually do far better outside we usually have you know a cop for ... or something and just scoop them up and put 'em right outside okay there's really no need to deal with it\nNow for certain things yeah there you know we can be annoyed with various types of flies mosquitoes but as I said they're simple way is even dealing with those for example with mosquitoes\nIf you're bothered well being outside of very simple method of\nKeeping you from being bothered is to set up some sort of fans mosquitoes are actually very poor flyers so if you have sort of a fan if you're on a porch with the ceiling fan of conception other fan um there are also some very simple techniques to reduce the breeding population and some types of mosquitoes like the house mosquito which is\nRequires really no effort and no chemicals\nWhatsoever so there are ways of controlling these where it's not a problem with you and so he can start living in harmony that these other species which we all depend on and that's what we forget about\nWe're dependent upon each other within communities were dependent upon our neighbors our government for also depended upon nature they're the ones supplying was with the food and resources and modifying the environment maintaining environments that we all actually have a good living absolutely\nLet me end on this down at the insect carry him what is the one animal down there than God's is the most you bring the most look at that\nI think it depends upon the end of it I think spiders are probably right up there a sense of aids are\nBut I think right now with our both the zoo events one of the things which doesn't necessarily cause shivers but it's actually one of the most popular things we have going on right now in sectarian when he first enter the insect term we have a video display and we changed throughout the year but right now\nIt's on giant insects in movies\nSo we all like a little bit of fear and we watch the movie is whether you know the giants mantis or the black scorpion or the Godzilla films with moss rough um\nFour different spider hymns that is at this time of year as one of our most popular attractions actually some people watch that and they remember those movies that they saw as a kid or going to see 'em it's a little bit of fear that's\nGrossly exaggerated but I think that's one where people get into that okay there's that fear but then hopefully when they go through the rest of the building they become educated as to their nothing\nTo fear there's something to appreciate there's something to respect and hopefully protect and that's
