time I'm thinking of dairy except for um ice cream which is frozen I always think of burying our as\nIt's already found work or how are you [laughter] have still leak correct [laughter]\nAll right Brenda be you have made more say now Tony was interesting but you you had\nNever heard of it ...\nIt was like yeah well see that's that's Toni that's all right thank you Brenda okay I'll get you to appreciate the call to see that okay\nBrenda makes so much sense I mean she's right about the squeeze two thing I've seen people do that but\nThat was the way she described it sounds really think about it it's upside down all the green stuff would be on the top up here and you'd be squeezed in from the bottom but the the green stuff would be inspecting it invading its right and you wouldn't even know it's there well you know what it does add some more flavor to it it's not that bad well her judges flavor yeah\nWell let's get back to the pickle pizza you ever had one Markey [laughter] you know the only thing I haven't had spinach pizza but there could be sounds pretty good 'cause I like pickles\n\nEthan ... typical pizza ever had one nope\nAnybody out there had to pick a pizza we're going to get this food stuff out of the way when the first segment would you ever ... would you try to reach out try darn near anything I mean it's not like you know you're asking me to put bugs on top of it um and I liked pickles and I like pizza so\nBut I like ice cream and I like pickled so I'm not going and combining those guy so comments on make a pickle ice cream or they would get you know probably at some point along the way they've um you know considered it wasn't in the old joke back in the days they usually do\nPickles and pizza ice cream in pickles was when you were pregnant you had the craving for it\nYeah those pickles that many you know [laughter]\nOr yoga interests of the things that I'd ever heard of a ice cream testifying pickles with mayonnaise when you're pregnant no don't want to add ... never heard that one I just what I've heard decay so that's another question that they go ahead mark ... got a text from the six when they the crust is the ... on\nThe sauces ketchup cheese bake hamburger bacon pickles\nWhat's the difference between that and they burger and they've never had a pizza get away\nAnd they know but she's right here I mean if you think about it\nAnd that's always been my thing was Mexican food is all the same food is just configured differently a taco is a burrito is the nachos [laughter] you know it's just it's just the way it's a kind of put on a plate or put in your mouth it's all there and the same thing with the hamburgers\nShe's absolutely right there it is you know I Would never I don't understand people who buy taco pieces are hamburger pizzas prison or they will get to go get a hamburger or just look at a taco I give you like pizza but still use you're going to order pizza get pepperoni and sausage or well I did also chicken or something well here's one reason\nIn in you used to be maybe it's not so much now you can get anything delivered but they deliver pizza they didn't deliver hamburgers delivery of food boys are evil and [laughter] and Markey's a is a recent phenomenon\nGang it didn't used to be where you could say I want McDonalds delivered to me I Want to whatever delivered to me it didn't happen\nThere

but all I can get a pizza so I Want a\nBurger compete in even though it takes you know\nBe too so I Want a burger beat him even though it takes you know two minutes to go get a burger took like a ... century to get a pizza and when the weather's just say that they only for the most we have Bob on the line Bob you're on all access so Jake insular\nHey Bob it's early\nIs talking about that you got

characters is Bill Pullman John Lewis\nBowman from twister and other movies who died here the last few years\nYou know he's the one that played the president and independence day in his on that many that limited series called the center\nWho am I thinking of then you're thinking of bill Paxton didn't you're absolutely right thank you every\nEverybody gets that could be Yeah Bill\nPullman is the president of United States in independence day and he's made a ton of movies he's in a a zillion things so his\nSon Louis placed up to all boy who's also Jack of all trades that this seedy hotel\nAnd the hotel is got a lot of secrets to so there's all these reveals which are interesting Scott I'm of them are never tied up Jon Hamm story is never tied up\nYou know wait for things to be somewhat tied up so and then some are and some aren't and character just appear and oh you're scratching your head it looks\nCool because it's got that that's retro vintage all that's on the swing it like rat pack stuff sixties you know it's got that really cool look and the one girl in it that is fabulous\nIs Cynthia and I just playing daughter last days she ... she won a Tony Award for the color purple a couple of years ago and this is her breakthrough movie rural and she plays\nA Motown like singer who was screwed over by a very ... mean horrible record producer\nSo she's trying to get back on track so she has a nice story she sings in the film and it's gorgeous but her heart just badly needed editing is very ... filmmaking\nDeliver given how many ... how many would you grade did you give it now the only the cowbell okay see mine that's I'm going to give it\nJust a single cowbell yeah [noise] yeah so there you go Markey did luck with that one now let's move on to first ma'am okay now better this well yes just\nFull of surprises many surprises there's a reason it's called ... and not Apollo eleven because if you were expecting it to be the blow by blow of how a Apollo eleven\nHappened that's not gonna be this trajectory it is about Neil Armstrong and his personal life\nNeil Armstrong was the bicycle rider correct [laughter]\nOh Neal is just one of those decent guy\nHe he has a family his wife has played by Claire toy and she's fabulous if you've seen the crown planes you young Queen Elizabeth she's fabulous you know we always talk about acting it's all through the eyes in movies yes oh she's out she just watcher I see this whole movie\nAnd Ryan Gosling not too shabby either he he internalize as Neal because Neal\nWas in the ... and boy it's not unlike Buzz Aldrin is a big show but I always rubs everybody the runway\nWho's played by Cory stall this has got a great cast\nThat director is Damien Cher sell who did ...\nOh okay and you would not know that he directed this\nSnow singing Neil Armstrong does break down into song and dance\nNo no but what happens is technically it's brilliant in\nFact it's probably a little too technical for people won an ethic adventure mhm\nThere's not a you know this is a story that we know but yet you're still surprised at and conflicts are all about all the work these guys remember when you're younger than I Am by the astronaut in the sixties were like rock stars\nI remember having me you know every time and uh one of the rockets took off for one of the rockets who's coming back we often I'm stopped school and um they gathered around the TV say\nYes\nBut the teacher a role in the TV for us to watch John Glen ... old but yes yes so that one gr says sense of wonder if these guys had a higher ideal now it's not about ten minutes about the purpose of the mission and I find that\nRefreshing to to do that a little bit of psychological work there but\nThey do not scrimp on the technology here when they land on the moon I was Katie it's breathtaking it's so gorgeous that shot that they pick\nOur attorney and now when Neal takes at first it up with is it's just you can't get emotional\nBe hungry it's just so emotional and how he handles it and you know they basically think if we're just doing their jobs but what a job that they had\nWhat an important job and kind of a say just is such a huge step for man time\nYeah so I'm I'm a NASA nerd just because I think the age I Am and and how we paid attention and it is the final frontier or\nDo you think because of its um technical capability and it's it's just it's brilliant that it will renew the idea that the astronaut never went there in the first place was a sound stage to begin with [laughter]\nI don't know I don't want to believe these these these crazy conspiracy theories\nWe had a guy on the other night a nickel talking about conspiracy theories but and that's you know that remains one of them that the that we never landed on the moon that we landed in Hollywood\nAnd I also want to bring up that this movie has plenty of flags okay whatever controversy about how it doesn't have a flag on the moon shot\nThere is a reason because it's Neal story and I don't want to give away a very significant plot point because I didn't know it and I want people to be a surprise to you think you know you know he was\nNot a shovel though he was he never wanted to be the center of attention but obviously he wanted that job and he was up for the challenge but\nYou know much about his personal life does there's this very very emotional story thread and it affects him and it affects his family and the sacrifices\nIt's red and it affects him ... family and the sacrifices that his family makes the emotional toll on his family has seen on the moon\nI founded just beautiful and very quaint and plenty of crying in the movie ever waving flags all the time when they come back in his room and I feel that isn't patriotic\nOn how many days I Know I Know how many uh what grade did you first man\nI should have given it a higher grade I gave it a beep but I think I should have given a mind we're going to give it for cowbell [noise]\nThere we go

I and I was hurt but a man it's like when when the when he said he'd been out of rehab for two weeks I was like I think he thinks that when\nShe needs to get back to\nThat you know [laughter] yeah so oh yeah okay surveys show up after all that after all that nonsense that their back and forth and win out on me showing up and then it\nCan get her much they gave me a much not fed\nAfter all that they gave you nothing to get you go back and get a jump on\nOver in charge him something sitting in your car\nOr give them the two hundred and fifty dollar a bonus\n[laughter] wow I mean seriously yeah I was just like hey you can look at five or ... well I came to me too\nTo in some sort of plot in there\nYou know porn films so home's really became most famous\nPlay a character called Johnny Was odd yeah and a\nWhile I was like this are typically satirical nor are you know\nThe figure ... you know he didn't six shooter carrots like\nWhat is reputed to be fourteen ensure that you know it was kind of like a goofy goofy kinda\nYou know it was kind of like a\nGoofy little goofy kind of skinny but his his mail member\nHonestly I'm without any trick photography it just looked like someone\nHad photo shop this perfectly proportion thing on to the sky but it was like way bigger than you know anyone else\nCorrect um and so\nHe he kind of a ... you can you know you can find the book it's not that expensive it's a\nE book or a a heart a paperback or you can find it on Amazon or most of your uh\nUh a e book outlet sits in all\nFormat um but you know you read the story of this guy it's like kind of a typical story of of a guy who wanted to be someone right and he was basically a kind of like a big loser his whole life\nAnd I mean it at one point he was a he was a an ambulance driver\nOr that's where he met his wife who was one of the women\nThat you saw in a in wonderland um\nAnd uh later he left that and I think his faith really began when he was he was working at a ... a a a meat packing plant in cutting California I'm prior to that he worked at a coffee ... factory making this little candies\nYeah um you know he had all these like shitty or can I say that at all any sort of a\nDead end jobs and so anyway it was he was working at the meat packing plant and I guess he was driving a forklift to name was taking me into the freezer and somehow he got\nPneumonia so he was you know off of work for a while on sick leave and anybody wasn't that sick so we started going to this poker\nParlor in another pick her ex place in California called ... a year and a\nSo one day the story goes he was out the colonel [laughter]\nIn between games and the guy standing next to him sort of like looked over and they said hey buddy I could make use of money\n[laughter] and I'm sort\nOf I don't want to give away my whole book but one of the\nOne of the great things for me about writing about the dark side of life um is that you know all kinds of well intentioned people who have decent jobs and like to read you know they don't want to read about being themselves they want to read about the other kind of people\nLike that I did the list of books that you've written about tattoos and to kill the Vince Neal story\nI'm the one I Want to do we have some time talk about the donut boys or is it just goes on and on and it is you know as they say the shot east side of life than the part of life that is we don't see on a daily basis we're glad we don't\nWe don't but the interesting thing is that I think it's it's a lesson that's a great for this time and every time is\nThat you know if things are never quite as you would ... would think they would be a they're never quite as their sole they're never quite as their tweeted\nYou know if you\nAre a lot of my stories that I've done I've lived with a crack gang of six hundred pound man I've lived with heroin users on the lower east side I I Do a lot of what they come to call literary anthropology\nWithout really sort of like living a living a reality show but you know the thing you find is that people were unexpectedly\nDecent human\nEven while they're doing all these things as society considers wrong um and I think anybody can write a story about a villain\nBut when you find the sort of creamy center I call it um then you understand a little more and then when the villain does his ability then you feel for him\nRight there is there are no individuals in life they're all good are all bad we are all somewhere along the spectrum\nIn between some closer to one side of the other\nEnd we had an FBI and former FBI agent on the other night talking about you did undercover worked for Thirty years and one of the things I asked him and said did you ever find that the people were decent people didn't have seen any kind of\nFocused on something else they could have made something of their life silly and oftentimes they were very interesting very decent people they just chose to engage in conduct that was wrong now\nThat made them criminals and they were caught for it but otherwise you know they were human beings and families and you know we'd be loved their mother and things like that\nThis has been the most you know over the forty years that I've been doing this since it's been the most you know startling conclusion that I can make 'em one that I always sort of preached to my\nStudents and and they want to listen and I I call it suspending disbelief and it's sort of means that\nYou know yelled back at the TV\nIt kinda just like shut up I'm In it and you listen and\nYou know maybe like you'll hear something you didn't realize was there right or maybe it will realize this person is really crazy and I'm right to have the thought I have but if you sit there and you're just listen\nGive Melissa and I saw this really great thing on one of these one of these uh TV thing\nWas one of these reports I saw it was a you know or I think it might have been from vice\nBut it was a young reporter and she was interviewing some young scientists and they were mapping out a the out put an input of everybody's social media or on the various political spectrum\nThe spectrums and it was very interesting sort of like the red side was all on one side and the blue side was on the other side and they were all communicating with each other but there are very few strands that we're going in between the two\n[noise] and you know I think that's the most important thing it's like\nYou know the like things in our country are so polarized now that nobody has an idea really about anybody it's just like you love 'em or you hate them but there is no real subtlety but you know that's the lesson that I mean there's a lot of subtlety and there's you know there is room\nThere is room for more understanding if you just shut up a second and listen no couldn't make a little deeper than a hundred and forty characters\nWe're talking with author journalist and consultant Mike Seeger written a lot of books a one which was the devil in John Holmes let me ask you about a wonderland for mom and again I don't want you to give away the whole book but\nA wonderland ends I watched the movie stars Val Kilmer we all know that Hollywood takes a lot of light green light as they call it\nIn your opinion how close was that movie to your book in what it probably actually happened and Laurel Canyon well\nActually happened and Laurel Canyon\nWell first of all I I ... the movie ... is our is set up sort of artistically so I think that\nYou know the reader is supposed to watch or is supposed to feel as Jang gold as John homes and and you know to back up a little bit um you know so you have this guy\nWho was the most famous porn star ever with one of the biggest most perfect members ever and then he runs smack dab in to a free base and crack cocaine um which gives you a great high but\nA ... a a constrictor\nIt's a very though constrictor so it tends to not allow your blood to flow in places you might need them if you were a porn\nStar decided I Do for that very well it can I interrupt the uh the activity\n[noise] uh so exactly so So Jon Huntsman came down and out and he started\nYou know resorting to a life of crime both to get drugs and to live um and\nSo his life with his straight white shattered and he began this weird affair with a Fifteen year old and his associations\nI'm with criminals grew any became involved in a murder um it was sort of in ... ill advised hit on a drug dealer right um who is a very colorful character himself I'm named Eddie Nash um\nSo you know I I think you know there's a lot of\nThere's a lot of stuff in that movie that's like pretty much like straight out of the storytelling but the story telling pulls back a little more and sort of tells you the story a little more clearly so you really know what's going on now um you know I think that the the movie is really good 'cause it's like
