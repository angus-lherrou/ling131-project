... for the mutual awards so I get to see the NASA up close and personal for a few days so let's jump right in our ...\n... you know our first guest Benjamin singer he is the communications director for clean Missouri\nThat is what they have named or nicknamed a proposition one and proposition one asked uh the voters to um to adopt a number of things a whole litany of things\nAnd we have talked about it on this show a number of times\nAnd most people that have been on the show say yes I Love one two three and four all in favor and then we get to five and it is the redistricting part\nA and I think Mr singer either through himself hey I'm just going to assume that my show is so great he was listening to my show and yet he heard it and said hey I'd like to come on and off or worse so happy to have you been having a we actually had asked everybody gets a chance so\nUm let's start a Benjamin singer I give you the floor this is your opportunity in a few minutes or less or more a tell us what you think proposition one does for Missourians sure\nSo to sum it up a ... one it's going to clean up Missouri politics does that in separate ways I think you know as Missourians we all know that big money powerful lobby\nAnd small groups of political insiders unfortunately have too much control and influence in our state politics um our legislature take nearly nine hundred thousand dollars a year in gifts from paid lobbyists\nAre gerrymandered districts protect Democrats and Republicans alike from accountability and our legislators are keeping their record secret while they require\nAll other parts of misery government to have open records and citizens have literally been kicked out of public hearings but there's good news it doesn't have to be this way so amendment one\nBut there's good news it doesn't have to be this way so amendment one is going to clean up Missouri politics in five ways it's going to stop expensive lobbyist gifts by putting a five dollar cap on any gift that a legislator can take from paid lobbyists it will require fair and competitive maps\nIt will make our legislature more transparent by requiring meetings and records to be open to the public it's going to tighten our contribution limits closing loopholes help get some of the big money out of politics\nAnd it's going to make politicians wait two years it's going to stop them from becoming paid lobbyist for two years after they leave the legislature so those are the things that does and it's gonna it's supported by a bipartisan coalition of reformers including the A R B\nYou can just be taking the sweet lobbyists gifts trips to turkey you know\nI'm five thousand dollar steak dinners about ... to get make ribs you could ... legislators are allowed to solicit and gifts from lobbyists you could go if you're a legislator you could go to a lobbyist and say hey can you get me a hundred and make ribs well and\nIf they want you to pass the bill and what they're getting buy you a hundred make ribs day but I'm Sorry if you want to become a legislator to get all the make ridge where it's shutting down [laughter] so you're not going to be able to do that or you could probably get one make read less than five bucks right that's right yeah\nI understand that and so let me just clarify for my own personal knowledge are we talking about just state Senate and a state rep seats are we talking about um the congressional districts as well great question so we were very careful about following the single subject pools\nSo you know Josh Holly when the lobbyists and we're trying we're suing to try to keep them in one off the ballot Josh highly defended us in court he submitted a brief on behalf of\nAttorney general on behalf of secretary of state Jay Ashcroft\nAnd he said that amendment one single subject and central purpose is to regulate limited aspects of the Missouri general assembly and its members\nAnd he said in his brief the measure if a ... by the voters would promote transparency and accountability and the general assembly so this is only state legislature\nAnd you know we're restricted by that single subject cruel to only address one that's article three of them is very ... so we're not dealing with statewide so we're not worried about an way measurements busy we're not worried about a mood\nClay none of those men when only are the legislature not Congress All right so how do you use and what does it require explained it to the to the listeners so\nUm you're talking about on their district strict on the redistricting portion\nYou know we see in St Louis county we see districts drawn\nAnd crazy ways to be safe for Democrats were safe for Republicans because right now the current process\nIs commission appointed by the parties and most of these commissioners who draw these maps are paid lobbyists our politicians\nOr political consultants and so they draw these to help their friends they're not looking out for voters and they're all partisan or all partisan Democrats or partisan Republicans the biggest donor in the state his personal attorney was one of the commissioners\nAnd there are no independence and the process and there's basically no transparency none of the day to use to put the maps together subject to the sunshine law if it gets thrown into the judicial commission\nThe judges have claimed they are not subject to the transparency laws either so we're requiring transparency and we're requiring clear criteria so we're keeping the fact that districts should be compact\nThey must be can take us\nThey have to protect majority minority districts\nAnd they have to have more partisan fairness and competitiveness\nSo I heard my ... and we're adding requirements for house maps to follow city and county lines when possible because right now that are totally ignored and you've got these districts that\nCuts cities and write small towns in rural Missouri so I I heard a ... even asked this question or at least or maybe it was a rhetorical question but he is question was if Missouri is sixty forty or Republican Democrat just assume I'm not saying it is sixty forty how do you make it competitive if\nIn other words you're trying to make a fifty fifty you know we're not at sixty forty no ... amendment one does not require fifty fifty you won't see that anywhere in it and that is something that the ... the lobbyists and the politicians who are are ... are forming the group opposing this if you look at the group opposing this it's a hundred percent\nPaid lobbyists and current or former elected officials ... they're making that up it's not in there it says that whatever the preferences of Missourians are that should be\nThe standard that we hold the maps up too so if it's sixty forty Republican Democrat the legislature should look somewhere closer to that it's not going to be exact because we're still requiring compact miss\nYou know work require we're adding you know saying they should be compact they should follow city and county lines when possible and ... and we're protecting minority representation so in the city of St Louis you're still going to have some districts that are Seventy thirty Democrat probably in northwest Missouri you're going to have some districts that are Seventy thirty Republican\nYou know that's allowed under amendment one and the makeup of the legislature will be more representative of the preferences of the voters of Missouri now it's hard to argue with that isn't it a ... you know give me some time [laughter]\nOh it's hard to argue with that is that\nA ... you know give me some time [laughter]\nI mean I Know you you spend a lot of 'em have tremendous respect for Senator John Danforth a friend of mine to fellow priest all of that too um and so he has come out and supported this there was an op ed with he and state senator a sharp\nAnd Johnson and single interesting I'll click read 'em but I Will point out they're not exactly the mainstream\nOf the Republican Party in Missouri right now you would agree with that actually they're all over the map so you know I Would say like Senator shops right\nIs you know he's extremely conservative I I think of him as a Barry Goldwater libertarian\nYou know senator Dan ... is a you know pretty thoughtful rectify man I'm and I'm not suggesting there's anything wrong with their points of view and then we've gotten representative Nick marshals Senator Jim Len key mother gory oh these are people who are\nYou know you look at it and it's a full spectrum of the Republican Party but it's reformers you know and so whether you're a Democrat or Republican if you like taking the sweet lobbyist gifts I Do like you know I don't I Know having safe elections where you don't have to worry about what your voters actually think of you\nYou're not going to want this if you're a former like the people were talking about they want it and they want a system that is responsive to the people ... more than the big donors and the lobbyists who are giving them twenty Seventeen record high\nOver a million dollars in lobbyist gifts last year\nAnd Benjamin singer he is the communications

to screw up his name on growing again yes\nHe is a Belgian director I think she\nWas a very sensitive to the subject matter and he really brought up the motion of connections and the toll it takes on a family and this kid goes from being this just you know great teenage kid to this may see aid and shell yeah\nIs something that we obviously need to face a there are folks that have no idea what it's like out there in the world of addiction there were more too many on the other hand than all ready no\nI'm In its it's going to take a lot of work in a lot of understanding in in may be a lot of twisted stomach you know maybe that's where we needed a little punch in the guts to say\nUm you know we need to do everything we can just to um to stop this from from getting worse\nI think the national media has brought a lot of attention to the opioid crisis which is great because kids are dying every day right how many people what did they say it was like a a ... there's this enormous amount of people that are addicted to opioids\nAnd this is crystal meth so it's not heroin but crystal meth is highly highly addictive\nHe remembers the days of of math you know here's the thing it's whether its message heroin and cocaine um that's just a another name okay yes right now we have to do something about the opioid crisis absolutely\nBut um what we have to really concentrate on I think is mental health and addiction and how are we dealing with that because we can stomp out stamp out opioids today and you know if we did nothing else some other drug would find a way it\nOh yeah oh yeah because it has their last year more than Seventy two thousand people in this country died from drug overdoses\nMhm right and um I think I read somewhere on the other day that the opioid use has leveled off thank goodness um unfortunately cocaine is back each time really people gave up on that it's something when meals maybe more\nA Harley not so and again when I talk about we have to address other things I'm Talking about a rehab I'm Talking about education and talking about all the things we can be doing I'm On the front end that will help people stay off of the drugs\nRight there have been so many parents who who move forward now and say hey this happened to me they're showing that it's just not you know your typical you know years and years and movies people portrayed drug addicts or in a very\nWho do you call it unrealistic way or like one sided\nDeal sure there were any really out or they were they were homeless you never saw it in the middle class you never saw the the high school kids you never saw the you know mom and dad you never saw the teenagers that's what we're dealing with today\nRight and people are stealing from their families and people are like and people there is also prefer going oh is it can't happen here we live in a town we live in a good neighborhood you know we go to the good schools\nAnd that's just living in la la land you know and so this is what I think is the best thing about this movie it's really like a PSA like face facts this can happen to\nTo anybody and this is one family's journey but it's so indicative of thousands of other people's journey\nAnd I think it's going to hit hit home it hits personally close to home for me and I think it gets it going to hit close to home it's not that it's not an easy for them to watch\nIt's a tough film to watch but it's an important film I think what this will do with its message it means it's a great\nFell absolutely Lyndon house um\nWhat'd you given I gave it a B plus that's ever going to give that retail bells\nThere it is I'm like I said I sometimes want to just stick my head in the sand to not deal with it but I think I'm going to force myself um to watch this one because I think it's necessary\n[laughter] yes I think the more people talk that communication that we have and there are just great people on the front lines in this country trying to do everything they can to get the word out and I applaud all those parents\nWho come forward and say hey it happened to my child and this is our story and I think that's why this is so important and I think that's why it has it emotionally resonates with people and um I I think you know it's\nAnd it's her preachy does that make sense\nBecause you know sometimes it's like oh no no no yeah\nYeah so I I like that about it it just felt so real it's dumped so lived in they felt like a family you you just feel\nThat Timothy Sallie Mae has been acting since he was Thirteen which I didn't realize I did

it's it's good I think I Am where I Need to be like you always have I feel like with any career you have that they want for more and you you get to where you wanted to be and then you're like okay what's\nNext the next thing you know so I you know I just have to keep doing what I'm doing I guess\nDo you find that people are defined you as a by the fact that you're a comedian or that you know that you're also you get new glasses oh so you know you get new glasses the other day you do this you're bartender your friend knew that but um but you're always ... the comedian\nWho is um there should be in the Waldorf hysteria as well and thinks that they are doing God's work um by setting up this the problem I have with that if there is anything real in those bombs okay\nIf if it turns out that any of those bombs could have exploded I don't think someone um take that chance you know does it in other words that's too far it turned out to be fake bombs\nThen then maybe I told you and I thought it was you know if they started sending the envelopes full of baby powder right I yeah I could see a Democrat anybody doing on either side because while you're going to prison for a while you know you're not going to kill someone bombs killed people\nAnd that's the problem I had with that theory is I just don't think someone would go that far I'm uh to do that but I suppose it is possible\nAnd that's all I I it just again it gets that little voice in the back of my head that says these were so outlandish late you know they should have been neon signs pointing at him and saying hey look it's a bomb silly\nI thought it was a stranger [laughter] I think\nYou're right and I went through this as you heard last night and said here all the things that they tell you never if you see this on a package never opened the package and every one of them was you know checked off that is UCs postage stamps you see you know then they said\nThat he checked I I'm just assuming it's man yeah we they said that there was like extra postage on ... that package as which may mean this person was just putting them in a drought and ... versus getting them ... yeah in her saying\nRight never you'll always see and that's why they said no one will ever take a bomb\nHell no eh we're an emblem full of 'em that powder or whatever you call that stuff right then and the other thing\nAnd then take it to the post office because there's a little thing on it then when you get that electronic stamp drugs that can be traced back immediately and then they go to the camera and there you are you know you buy stamps to a Home Depot or nor worried Office Depot\nAnd then you put them on and then you in the dark and now you go to a postage or drop and drop 'em there\nWell if I'm going to leave it to the expert I mean this is obviously outside of my pay grade as most things in life are but I'm the\nIn listening to the commentary today and I did feel vindicated I could not listen I woke up and I heard an NBC talking all about this bomb\nAnd that's where it's like okay this is starting to suck the air out of the other stories that are going on and you know could theoretically kill the Republican momentum whatever that momentum that was it was like I feel that I felt vindicated in my belief that there there there\nWas something kind of politically a foot and if I'm wrong I'm wrong I I I but I just you know we kind of know the players and the industry in the end and you know to be honest with ya I mean if\nIf you believe that the FBI was involved somehow in Russian conspiracy theory\nCould not someone with a versed in bomb making you know it was set something up like this and and I ... the thing I heard on the radio or via the commentary was going to send a bomb through the mail you wanted to detonate when they open the envelope coordinated with the time\nYou know you put a little trigger on here since ... years where I completely stop I you you anybody who suggested loses me instantly when you say\nThat uh you know the the this is a is that it's the deep state and that somehow the FBI was in on it or somebody in the postal service was in on it or the ... than it was anything other than\nSome knuckleheads expands the Tron than doing it themselves if you and that's where these conspiracy theories they want to say um they want they want to get to be they want to get JFK and and you know again there's thousands of people that are keeping the secret doesn't happen and\nAnd I was trying to save thousands of people are are you know I I just like I say I just I find the tiny not I find that the package I guess everything about this story\nThere's just a little proof trigger this kind of rain in my head saying okay you know\nIs there more to the story than meets the eye and it it really in jail I don't say the wrong it could be some guy with the visuals of Granger saying that you know he's gonna you know he's going to do this for the glory of all and and uh you know you you will be right in your opinion\nWill see I I Want him I Want to use what I Want to just say well no one was hurt\nTo exactly I Want them to catch whoever did it and I want them to be punished a strongly I'm In my here's the thing I'll tell you when that whole Caribbean started up from a Central America and in the Republican started gaining ground\nOr you know as a result of their of India I had to go do a little Google Search the were Oliver North was\nSitting around back into comedy and I actually I guess she is far more entertaining than I generally bars always a
