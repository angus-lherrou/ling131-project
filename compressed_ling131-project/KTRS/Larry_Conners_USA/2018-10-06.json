guy on the show [laughter] to like him a lot to do so how'd you get into comedy Netflix really [laughter] I'm sitting there and I got lazy and fat from Netflix\nHas a great story is always start there and so when I saw one of those but it started off I was just watching a bunch of stand a big fan of it in I might I could try to ease mhm so I got on stage one day and I didn't do horrible for my eyes and I tried again because I haven't seen people die\n[laughter] I'm all for a minute I've been up for four hours\nI mean [laughter] I didn't do bad so am I you know what I'm keep going with the same here I Am I get feature\nEver did you did you find yourself you said you know I'm up here the first time and I'm not doing too bad\nAnd I would imagine because your expectations are relatively low at the beginning then you try and a few more times you get some higher expectations and maybe the results did you ever have kind of a midlife crisis or mid career crisis at the point where when a man and I don't know what happened but it's not working\nAnymore they're not shape but I got\nSomething to look for [laughter] that's an I\nUsually tell people that 'cause they always told me that I was good or not I don't believe it I just think that their expectations of me it was so low that when I did better than your funny nah I'm not really I just thought it was some\nParents [laughter] when I first started making movies people to come out and they go you know what\nI got to tell you I wasn't expecting much of this kind of expecting my whole movie version and it was really pretty good I'm like I guess that's a good thing [laughter] right no right or your expectations were so low that I exceeded them um what kind of comedy do you like oh\nOkay I stay away from certain topics that and make everybody may and I kind of stick to stuff to everybody can relate to so I avoid politics saying OK religion and stuff like that so I'm mostly talking about relationships same oh you should stay for all to something dark then why not ... right after that I went back\nOver there and I you join us for the all access round table after dark to show that somebody called your relationship guru right\nTrue true now what is you might have been drawn but [laughter] it was going to respond them I think they really want to [laughter]\nDo you uh are you in a relationship or are you just good at it as would need to helping others who are\nUm in one and good at helping but mine's not good right now so you learn from the hey I'm right from the band that happens and you kind of you know what I'm Talking about this this this and then you don't have I heard the shows that way that\nTray now he ever get back to her ... has it ever made it back where you've done a show in St Louis and somebody was in the crowd and then it kinda circled on back to ... hours and you're in a relationship with non I said but again I got something else to look for that tomorrow [laughter]\nI'm calling to look forward to work you you've been at it and how long\nAre about five years now five years or you feel uncomfortable yeah is it gets better each time he still had a nervous feeling right before you get on stage but besides that is is the greatest feeling make people laugh I feel like\nFor the little time Mitch offstage people forget about everything bad going on and they laugh they might have ... states do or case if they live in a car or\nAnything like this is like yeah no no no that's wrong about all the little time to save my life you know feeling now but in that time you you\nKnow you're opening for your feature in for a joke tore I understand you also put for cat Williams to ban it not only is he funny funny funny he's he's he's a little crazy though to me\nAnd it's actually a crazy story it was actually because of a funny bone and I got that opportunity I guess one of his openers were was sick that day so funny by being a nationally known they called her and I was in anybody that they can recommend ... and the funny bone suggests to me on my artist so dope but they didn't tell me first\nWith a\nLongtime friend of mine Jeff Michigan Jeff [noise]\nYou got to have you had to turn out as Mike that's a part of the game they go hey good evening and you brought your son with him again now the editor and ran my ... year old birthday over Kobe steakhouse excellent that's a\nReally nice birthday to you guys so anyway [laughter] sixteen will do it now I live in a a I\nThink looking watching him grow up from about a user kindergarten you out with you about that and\nHe's been one of those young men who always had his baseball glove with him at the time he always had a baseball glove and a a tennis ball in the glove in the ... and I've done that say this because that's a great thing because that's how you know you always ready for a game of catching if not and you just throw it against the wall\nMan look a Jew planes for the St Louis red birds fly ball to two games tomorrow and argue bichon\n... that's the other like to ... or Space Center feeling pitching wow All right let's get to some tax and then I Want to talk to you Jeff Michigan I'm gonna let you on the show that I tend to be a little more moderate and we'll let you take a victory lap after the cabinet are oh yeah I'm like what do we have on the ...\nOr ... for went through sixty one part of the program from the three one for mustard only never catch up dirty dogs with a brick and mortar store on highway Kate in O'Fallon, Missouri a they have a bacon wrapped all be dog with peanut butter and brown sugar\nNow that the dog dirty dog tax from Don fail it fails food man on Twitter okay\nThat that to say they give it to give it as a ... again Don at stake at the health food man on Twitter\nThat's right it is dirty dogs need to have him on the show them we do that to allow that to this or that are so did Jeff Michigan you know known each other a long time and I was going to talk about the Kavanaugh nomination for a little bit we ... we tend to be um a take it a little easy on Friday nights don't don't like to get into the political\nBut I as I said is the show started you can't talk about something all week long and then when it actually I'm going to happen then ignore it [noise]\nUm I have been a little bit outspoken in that uh I didn't think it was handled well by either the Democrats or the Republicans\nAnd I also have been outspoken in that I didn't think the judge handled himself well at the hearing\nBecause his temperament which is so important you know there are lots of elements for a good judge one is intelligence one is impartiality or another is temperament\nAnd I didn't see that um I I thought Matt Damon did a pretty good job on Saturday Night live but you are you tend to be a little more conservative on these things than me so um are you in the rest of the evil empire celebrating tonight [noise]\nWell I don't know about the evil empire\nBut I think if you\nLook at his qualifications uh-huh I Would say that he's eminently qualified and that's the first one and I would agree with\nYou there and he\nHas been a judge for many years on the DC circuit which is a huge circuit it's one of the busiest circus because all that\nAll of the uh the cases coming out of a Washington and relating to taxes in statutes so yeah for ten years and that's a lifetime appointment to ramp Kate is in his temperament no one mentioned one thing about his temperament for twelve years on the DC circuit and all of a sudden it's temperament\nSupposedly changed which well you saw with Matt Damon did you do it is so I mean that in you know if if Matt Damon what they're you know we're just supposed to be looking at the judge Kavanaugh I agree with you ... it was unfortunate and\nHere's where I've decided that I was driving in tonight that I had to make this concession and that concession is at this point um\nI wasn't a I didn't get to see the FBI supplemental report that I don't think anyone except the senators right uh and so I don't know what it said but nobody seemed to come out of there screaming and yelling and saying oh my gosh this is horrible so I assume\nIt um it all but uh I don't want to say at exonerated him because nobody can exonerate him but God if you believe in God because between the two of them there are three people there and ... and\n... we had different stories so you're never going to know but I don't think there was anything in there to corroborate in other words nobody could say ah there's enough evidence it just like on a football or there was not enough evidence to overturn McCall\nThere's no instant replay says what do they call it senators in New York indisputable evidence to the replay yeah no you're absolutely right there is no evidence and you if you believe in\nGod but uh you know I think a\nQualification speak for themselves you know this education and his experience and I think in the old days this and it was a more gentlemanly environment rush regardless of whether you lean left or lean right those days appear to be gone which I'm\nSort of do you and I know we can I bring you in and ask you about this not to put you on the spot Jeff because it's it's an all in good fun and I know but but then we've had these conversations ourselves\nAnd but in terms of the political portion of it did it bother you as a Republican ... ... what was going on in the Senate did you think this was a big um [noise]\nA set up by the Democrats\nWell again I\nI I only see what everyone else saw on CNN and all the other news channels at MSNBC and Fox\nBut I I from my observation point\nI think it was an intentional a lynching is maybe too strong but I think a a\nBig fan of rushing ambushing that's the right word Jeff Flake agreed to give it a week and the Democrats jumping for joy and said that's great but in reality the week wasn't going to be enough\nYou know it would never was and again is probably a week wasn't enough in ten years wasn't enough probably because\nAgain or whether you did some point you're never going to determine what happened that night in that room and let somebody where it's going to change their story or um whatever his name was mark judge judge a was going to have a clear bore her one of those moments where you know he was not blackout drunk\nAnd my democratic friends still think they're speaking of the good lord there'll be some intervention divine intervention morals tell me what happened and it's not so you don't want to gloat and even if it is a sure thing you don't want to gloat and what comes around goes around I'm sure\nAre friends from Nevada what was his name Harry Reid when he changed it you know at that law still been in place that would have been the sixty votes to begin with so\nI miss those days so then when they took sixty votes um you know that really we talk about a cooperation we've talked about reaching across the aisle right um those days are gone back when you need to\nAnd we've talked about reaching across the aisle right or those days are gone back when you needed sixty post that meant you had to call it and you had to court someone right and you had to put together legislation that would allow somebody to walk across right now right\nIn those days and then the question is what is going to happen in the future if anything to bring that back you know do we stay up part from this point on her ... looming happened in the future that brings the party's back together\nAnd I don't know what it will be unfortunately ... what is it in in the past is another war I mean quite frankly you look at where everybody when we when we get back together well when the United states has attacked or we end up in the lab and right right now and that's what everybody says okay now we can agree on things\nAnd that when you started grading things you start saying you know we don't have that much\nThat is different right there's not a lot of differences you know we agree on most and and and but ...\nAnd so I was a Kobe steakhouse kids enjoy themselves and to have plenty to eat these growing boys and or\nDo they cook it right there at the table cook it right there at the table and it's quite an operation like they both step up to the microphone their young man ... you can you share with your dad and so I Want to ask you about that for a little bit closer and what did you have steak\n[laughter] okay [laughter] that's okay I'm Glad you didn't have a right at the end you didn't go to the steakhouse never salad oh this is true I I did have a salad so that's\nOkay but you have to have the steak with it you can't do they cook it and they cook it right there at the table mhm do they liked it up there mhm what do they add is that why does like the flights up your steak you know I don't know you don't know how to use a knife and fork against\nLine his mother was there to know why they\nDo [laughter] um and to ah who's your buddy with your name is Matthew yeah what was that other school but they are up to him there and they're good buddies I'm ... now where do you

times because this thing goes on for several months\nIt does we're starting to gear up now but they did it as three rounds the first round is in February second third or the preliminary round we usually have anywhere from a hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty acts them out a way of\nProfessionals from throughout the area who come in or judges we have we do multiple sessions but there are four judges that each one it's actually really cool because the kids perform and then\nProfessionals from around the region we we've had people from the rap on them around Gibbs from stages and all of our people and they give honest feedback to these kids and and they're kinder than you'd be if this were a real audition button they're honest with them and they tell him what they're doing right they find something that they're doing wrong and\nAnd what's really fun is so we have the first round and then we narrowed down to fifty people ... for the second round and you really see the kids kind of grow with their ... and what they were told\nAnd then finally from that we narrowed down to anywhere from twelve to Fifteen acts that get to perform on stage at the Fox in the finals which\nThen yeah

okay if you want to participate in the show we appreciate your comments I for one to six and ... you're a second year I didn't hear it right to Lindsey Walden go hand one of the things that I wanted to talk about tonight there were a couple of days you posted on your Facebook page a great topic\nI wanted to cover the one I just posted\nOr the one I posted yesterday the one the one okay just today oh I posted a whole thing about um another part of my two story and I got a lot of response to that so I Know we're going to talk about that later in the show so I just didn't know that a little bit about me to church or a hashtag me too movement up ah so that's one area that we have to talk about\nFolk life or one to six the second is the thing I posted on Facebook\nWhich is now was how do you settle disagreements what do you do like do do you ever come back around when you've had an argument and settle things do you let things go how how good are you at letting things go at sort of a multiple multitude of question\nWhy it out of the answer for that I don't need you to to tell because I Know exactly how you know that they had to do it okay good heard the topic is a little more technical a little more clinical okay\nThat about myself because as much as I Want to help people if someone like if I if I'd like let's say somebody comes to me and goes yes I absolutely did this crime and then I have to defend them I couldn't do it I'd be like no they did it they they are guilty\nLike yeah I really did they ever come to me and said they did it because you know what I Know that there are no but I guess my point is and then we'll we'll move on okay Lindsey Walden is [noise] I I Am troubled by in a struggling with this idea that\nUm that you\nAutomatically have to take one person's word over the other\n... a ... and I that's the part I'm struggling with an even hard it's hard enough when you're sitting back here at thirty thousand feet and washing Kevin on judge\nA area and I'm a doctor for an ... it's even more difficult when you're right there at twelve feet and and in doing it in your you're like oh my gosh I Know these people have been there\nI don't know what to do right [noise]\nUm and so in my ... is it just started damned if I Do damned if I don't am I going to be attacked with no matter what by one side saying you're um you know you're aggressive male um alpha male and you'll never understand\nYou know like I like what I had to say but maybe you're too close to the situation to be objective because I think if your emotion and the situation makes you think that you should side with one over the other rather than looking at the reality of what is likely to have occurred then maybe that's why it's clouded\n[laughter]\n\nFirst let's say ... and yeah and you may be right right and sometimes the problem with the doctor a lawyer any type of people professional sometimes you're too close to it I guess my point is\nIsn't it okay at the end of the day if your friend mhm comes to you and then he looks you in the eye and says I did not do it more looks you in the eye and said\nIt did happen\nTo side with that person and say I believe you\nI mean I guess at that point yeah you have to just make your judgment call of like what movie who are you ... as a more credible sort a witness to the situation at that point and I think it's one thing to support one person and maybe say I think this is a credible story I think it's another thing to actually look at the other person to go no you're a piece of crap and you're wrong\nI mean I was very bad right yeah I'm not well I might say that I shouldn't say never never but but in this particular case I don't want to say that to her I get to I Want to say doors stop and get her public thing yeah you know you got to put an issue you know direct route to the source\nKnow and and that's the thing where okay so if we're going to offer a devil's advocate purposes say that that her story is absolutely credible invalid\nOr ah devil's advocate purpose is to say that to her story is absolutely credible and valid that\nIs telling it in a public way is how she gets healing and she's able to move past whatever occurred then that's where I'm also going to say she has a right to do that whether or not it falls in line with what is sort of the quote unquote politically correct thing to stay indoors do Mm that's\nSort of a judgment call what then okay now you're now you're now you're caused me to continue on here ... there was less you about the next one one of the things that I have done is told this person to not engage\nRight that's good yeah now\nAt some point if it doesn't stop the person is going to say I can't continue to have this out there and not engage I've got to come back and say you're ...\nYeah I don't think that's what you say at all ever All right I'm just good real some don't say that you know I mean I mean\nSo that now yeah in order to do what he's got to come back and say you're a liar yeah you've had all these problems in relationships where you have acted like this in the past\nBeen allegations that that's different I don't know these are no that's why but by point is right that it starts you get into those details and why is bend the public\nPlatform ... the place to start airing these public\nWell I'm not saying that because I think you know and that's the point that I've made all along is that I Know I share things in a really public way but I sort of made a choice in a commitment to do that just based on kind of who I Am and what I Do and how I Would like to\nHelp people in the same situation but not everybody is necessarily in that same boat and if you're a tech or by name I Do not look at it this is different too because ... are out there yeah\nBut that being the person who's also a public figure so right and that being said though\nIf I felt that it was you know\nIf this if the person that that that that was like the the major attack or in my life I've had the other like minor incidents that have occurred where people live either push boundaries are very inappropriate to sexual harassment sort of way but when we're talking about the the actual story that were like the what helped me join this movement so to speak um if if he were to somehow be up\nFor some major public office oh you better believe I Would and who would be the first person saying no that isn't going to happen ... you know\nI'm ... whether or not I would be lifted too are believed or\nYou know giving validity it wouldn't matter because at that point I Would be doing what I felt was right so I think it is it's a very it's a complex issue that we need to talk about that when you need to be discussed because it's not going anywhere and we got to figure out what to do with it because it's here but\nIt's existing we just got to deal with it and it wouldn't it be great if we could or they would say they nip it in the bud yeah we stop sexual assault that on the main road that we really enjoy it all up is a right from the start\nThat would be amazing I I Wish that there are a way to snap our fingers and make that occurred but I\nFeel like by way of things I Know there are people that don't like to me too movement there are people that get angry about the fact that that it even exists but I Would argue that it is part of what is required for us to move debts from what it has been to what it needs to be and the process of getting from from where it was to where it needs to be\nThere is some ugliness involved in that transition is hard to change you to turn off and it doesn't look pretty in right now we're seeing the really ugly reality of it play out in front of us I think\nI think you're absolutely right that when sleep will be in the world and um it is eleven twenty six this is all access after dark and we will be right back [noise]\nWhere do you have seen them\nYou're volunteering to make a difference\nYou know

R. S.\nOver\nAccess to care for the big five fifty K. E. T. R. S.\nFor\n\nWhere you're not taking care of your stuff whatever yourself as\nYou can have that conversation but\nPeople do not read minds and when people just sit there and faster on resentment\nAnd the other person has no idea that they cannot no how upset you really are about whatever that thing is because you are telling them if you weren't telling them and there's no way they can no yeah it's just it's very complicated but it doesn't have to be if we just talk\nSo let's start we have about four minutes with a little bit about that because sometimes things just talk a little bit harder and I will be the first to admit\nI'm not the greatest communicator when it comes to ... and not just sometimes with my wife but with a business colleagues or others Graham times I tend to be a little more reserved for\nHim and rather than just kind of talk it through like that I'll be I'll do the guy thinks suck it up move on we'll talk about it later right um and the um\nUh so how do we get started give me some easy kind of points to to start with just say you know you might try this or this well\nFirst of all you don't want to try and have conversations that are really like deep and
