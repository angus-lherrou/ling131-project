St Louis county makes a lot of unrest and a lot of citations um but that's just those three police departments while we find out and that's great\nWhile we find out that\nUm well let me go back to metro has their own police force okay these are security guards that they've hired contracts security guards to give them some security of their facilities and metro so they do facility work\nThen there's another group that does security for metro\nFor buses and for trains and things like that so they have certain specialties okay so we've got five security forces here working together to try to provide safety on the whole system okay\nThat's great guess what we find out that none of their walkie talkies work to talk to each other so directly directly I and that's that's important\nAnd what that means as if somebody gets on it handily roads station ... commits a crime and somebody reports that\nAn officer needs backup or he sees it but he got on the train and takes off a he's got to be able to call the same city and say he's coming your way next up yeah a lot you know he's got a white T shirt on and you know jeans whatever can't do it\nNext up yeah and like you know he's got a white T shirt on and you know jeans whatever can't know to walk talk he contact\nNot directly what they have to do is the St Louis county police officer has to call the dispatcher for St Louis city who then dispatches just somebody's available to that station or whether the next station is for that suspect okay well if they don't respond quickly or if there's nobody available\nThat officer you know why can't go here then he's got jumping his car and go to the next station you know what I mean and all the way down the line uh and the same way with Illinois um and then what's even worse is that the if the metro security people are are there um\nThey can only talk among their cells to their dispatcher and if they want to get a a county cop involved they got to call their dispatcher AT Metro metro calls nine one one at St Louis county which then calls the the officer on that beach so\nIt's it's a lot of this kind of stuff so we got so frustrated so a couple of weeks ago for a justice been about three weeks ago I had the chief\nBelmar there I had the a captain is in charge of metro security for the county there in a meeting and two technicians from our um a ELC the handles our radio\nAnd I said guys and when the rest of the council was there I said I was invited you to talk about this specific specific problem and everybody says your radios don't talk to you know why don't they talk together so then we got a whole presentation why they don't talk together but they say and this is the light at the end of the tunnel there is a fix comic mhm\nAnd they are thinking thirty to sixty days but it will only be a fixed between the three police forces for them to talk together on a talk station or frequency on the digital radio the good thing is we're all in the same digital radios but they all have different frequencies and all this kinda stuff so\nLet's let's do this all work out either we're working on you know because I Want to start on this day because that is a short answer and I want to talk a little bit more about this because to me that's fine\nTalk away but that doesn't make it any safer really take a quick break is nine twenty six gates here at the big five fifty this is all access we have St Louis county council ...

to uh I mean I just talked about this for a a just a\nMoment it's in the St Louis Post Dispatch it is about my case\nAnd um I mentioned briefly the other day the St Louis Post Dispatch picked up the story some cells in Illinois prisoner so small it's inhumane to house to inmates in them judge says\nUm I tried that case over in federal court in East St Louis um and my client is a great Turley\nAnd the court agreed that you cannot house to human beings to grown men in what amounts to about forty square feet and after you account for the bed it's about twenty square feet imagine twenty square feet it's about the size of your backseat of your car\nIt's about the size of a just a regular closet literally a closet in your your hallway or as a kind of pointed out on Facebook imagine sharing your half bath not your full bath with the shower and all that you know that half\nBath you have that just got a toilet and then the sink and a little bit of space imagine sharing that with another man\nTwenty four hours a day for the next Twenty years of your life are huge are proposing yes so I Am I Am is go ahead [laughter] and that's what it's like because they don't get out of their cell and add on top of that that in the summertime it's going to get to be Ninety five degrees in there\nOne of I'd forgotten that one of our witnesses said and the judge pointed this out he said one of the witnesses described it it smells like it's like living inside the or the a spouse at the St Louis to have you ever going in there and smelled\nThat yeah it's been a primate house in the summertime is food thrown at me as well that yeah yeah and that's what they say it's like because that's what it is it's it's like a long line of um of port a potties with some bumps and them\nUm that's about the size ... or ... he had done yeah I'm so and and the judge you know kind of said that it is inhumane\n... either for twenty three hours to get like on our ... now I live day on a good day\nIf everything goes fine they're in there for twenty hours a day\nOn a bad day and there are ... periods of time when they shut the food they have what's called lock down where there's a fight where something's going on\nAnd they're in there for twenty four hours a day and I've been doing these cases for a long time and I know this for a fact and the judge pointed it out it's gotten much better but there were some times of the few years ago where for thirty to sixty days they were on lockdown they may only get out for an hour a week\nAt now\nI Know there are folks out there that say well they deserve it um that's what\nHappens when you break the law these are bad people yes they are a ... people that have done very bad things are there are still some very bad people in their my particular client has been in there for twenty plus years twenty five years I no longer consider him to be a bad person but he's still there for doing what he did\nBut you don't treat people like that\nUm you you treat them humanely um you you know that's all there is to it I don't care what they are we give prisoners of war you know humane treatment we ... we treat dogs better a dog in a
