franchise history [noise]\n\nWell Jim you'd like to finish with the wind but nonetheless she knew coming into this game\nIt was a time as well that was the lack of effort [noise] especially at the beginning of that second half they had some excellent opportunity is home site did\nAll the all the energy they quite a bit better at the start of the second half as well but they rarely with the exception of two or three opportunities had really no legitimate goal scoring opportunities all night long [noise]\nGood defended by Louis congratulations will be all around and we're going to have a fun after nine to show by the way down stairs but just smoke is going we've got\nOh yes green smoke tonight from the little again [noise] St Louis qualify for the u._s. do play off [noise]\nWell deserved the group there's work through a lot of diversity a lot of injury even tonight\nTo key players on the ... going it's all said and done [noise] they get all the hard work in front of a big trial tonight and everybody's happy and it was we looked at the two thousand Eighteen schedule Jim\nI think mark this myself I think a stretch from the twenty eighth of July the fifteenth of all gross won they won for consecutive games when they absolutely needed points they got twelve a valuable point they're\nReally really got back into the thick of things at that particular stage of the season\nHis Anthony pillows tells all those players and the assistant coaches echo his sentiments\nTrust the process it will work they did not very close things during this week a practice other than [noise] other than to point out the importance of this last home they\nDid what they needed to do tonight St Louis zero zero drawl and they will advance in the U.S the play offs\nI Will tell you this against whom you do not know exactly right your parents awake so some are all to find out where St Louis has going for sure but there is you mentioned a small park ranger game will determine where everybody ends up going and we still got games tonight which is going to determine who\nThey had a little rotation of players between the center for it and some underneath guys and they could play a little combination of free of all love wide and they had a couple of dangerous moment [noise] um so I thought if he did a good job at half time after the guys who get a little higher and disrupt the rhythm of okay see\nSt Louis which that draw [noise] Austin march comes off the bench it creates a little spark because well the minute he was on he was printing it was great to watch was he he got\nA couple of services for you um I can see now why a college street and um\nTo lease street and takers are the are starting wide forests Austin is a little careless compared to the other two with the ball but for the last Fifteen minutes of a of a game for him to come in and provide some servicemen and attacking sparked a I absolutely can see that as being a a great role for him\nGoing forward Michael Cox did not score tonight when he gets a stark than was active during the season\nAnd he smacked one and the bread and make a good say on so I thought Michael was okay in the first half although he provided the service for the best chance of the game right when buyers made to save the guy didn't believe I yes I I was unbelievable I\nFirst thought he hit the post but really upon the replay they they did say he made the safe so but you're right it\nWas it was incredible but getting back to er Cox he had that moment in the first half I did the EU is great outside of that second half I thought it was pretty solid had some good hold up play was pretty creative in the Eighteen a couple of times where he got chances off so it's a good performance in interesting selection for the good performance from ...\n... you know we talked about Craig out so Cox gets the opportunity Tony walls solid self expect within a replay scene wall fall\nYeah just just as passes or on the money he defends he does everything that you ask if the guy to do he's he's been a ... it was I thought it was really good again tonight just he he can he can\nYou know we talk about wall fall on his ability to to string big balls and connect to connect the game over a greater distances\nBut Tony ... little balls and the people that he ... that other guy just can't seem to get into a weed bends them around people his timing is really good when he when he gets the bosses foot [noise] um so he's a he's good in that way and then obviously on the defending side nobody could get beyond the guy\nHere was dynamite tonight I mean everybody played well one thing that was evident tonight [noise]\nEven though there weren't many goal there were no goals but there wasn't a lot of opportunity if you weren't able to play well in tight spaces you were going to fail\nYeah yeah and both teams I thought that a good job of trying to it when they won the ball connecting to get out of that site area get it freed up to the other side and then start to a then start to get things going\nUm you know and then you know try to generate attack from from that position so\nYou know it was interesting game and it looked like it looked like two teams very similar similar styles similar commitment levels [noise]\nUm it's interesting because I felt like games that we played against him in the first two years of the of the of the littler in the league right is just to evenly matched teams that are trying to figure out ways I thought we were a little bit better I thought we had a few more chances\nUm but you did feel like that at one slip and the Shaun Shaun Brown could\nOpen a game up and and uh and and kill ya but you know what at the end it didn't matter because San Antonio drew\nThat says what one draw in that final tonight to San Antonio they were following up top they scored in the twenty fourth but then in the ... the first minute it was a level with Rio Grande valley and that's one one draw in that match\nMe while I can tell you Reno Eighteen sixty eight has a three one lead on Orange County papa Noel has scored twice\nIn that one and the votes in his scored four Orange County a monarchs have a one nothing advantage over Fresno is they now play in the thirty seven all these games metals matter for sitting\nRight now and then Portland is taking on Phoenix there just aren't aware no score and that one Sacramento has they want nothing lead over the Las Vegas flights they scored in the second method of their match and oh by the way small park place tomorrow that's right\nThat's right now we're going to end up\nWe're going to end up either in seven or eight right yup we're going to end up in seventh or eighth and er who was a that was that bird\nOh we thought we had all kinds of people walking by giving his sums up at lunch and sometimes that yes that was that whoever that skinny guy [laughter] it is a it's a fun place\nTo be at tonight so seventh or eighth is where the teams are going to end up you play on the road but nonetheless you're playing and that's all that matters at this point because even in the west I think it's been at least two years or oh the number one seed is going down ...\nLet me let it get real monarchs last year right yeah I think it's been two years in a row and swallow were like seventh or eighth year before and right and I don't remember who was at first but may have been Sacramento at that point but yeah I I Believe it right and and you know it's interesting it could it could happen again um\nBut you know again the looks like Orange County first place possibly Phoenix to Phoenix what's tonight or they're winning\nThey are zero they just they just don't go away their ...\nAnd so that the little be interesting you know Sacramento or are they playing right now\nThey are they're up one nothing okay 'cause they've scored early in that matched us just under way as well come on Sacramento\nYeah I'd love to see the love to see Sacramento in the in the game you know if if swells when tomorrow a that would give them fifty three points tied with us and uh\nAnd they would have Fifteen wins are fourteen so they would they would be seven place we would be a that's the one piece the scoreboard watching that we have for a for tomorrow and Jim if that happens\nYou would have been fifty three point right on the money to get a spot to get into\nThe playoffs and Dale is since July you've had its out is that it's going to take fifty three points that crazy and there were some that were going I don't know\nThat that I don't think that many clothing weeks even you know let's be fair I I started at fifty three and I wavered the fifty one and then I jumped back to fifty three so let's let's be honest but fifty\nIs going to get St Louis in with the draw tonight or taking care of business at home\nIt let's put this in perspective you came into the\nTaking care of business at home\nIt let's put this in perspective you came into the this week\nKnowing you need it for you had a week off\nTwo guys that have been very key and you're starting to love and we're not able to play in both of these matches\n... you find a way to do exactly what you needed you get a win on Wednesday and you get to draw here tonight that says a lot about you know you know what's it at hand it's not that easy just to go out and do it\nAlso was also had to and had to be that way also was the right thing salsa\nRegardless of players playing injuries whatnot that was the way it needed to be tonight\nCompletely different story tonight the real test against a team that knows they're out this year but they're preparing for next year and a much say preparing for I mean [noise] acquiring players to prepare themselves to be ready for next year in fact I wouldn't be surprised\nTo see okay see take 'em a month off and start training in December in preparation for the season just because of how aggressively they went after some players to add to the roster here during the season but I never seen or us all by the way I've never seen a U.S all the ads\nSaw much quality to their team mid season as okay\nSee I was something they did all very well not only did they call the mashed quickly yeah and that's not an easy thing to\nKnow I mean just looking at the players today that we saw a troop Becky\nThe center back I thought was very good as the first time I've seen him play he was a he was a mid sees an ad on the shore and brown was a late season had a boost those who started underneath and kind of played in attacking a ten roll\nA was a late addition as well and there was one more that skip and make but they had four players that were\nMid season so late season ads that have made a very big impact\nOn the Soyuz hero zero draw here tonight\nSt Louis and everyone's happy there are people waving and giving thumbs up I I've never seen before and I'm not sure we know who they are but they're all happy and that's what it's all about and everyone on math because that's right that's right\nWhat about you know we talked about the results are over this past week\nBut I think I'd go back to\nThis three games didn't where it was Reno at home [noise]\nSalt Lake city on the road and slow on the roads you remember those who yeah he's yeah and that was that was a what six seven points against three difficult teams again Reno at home\nAnd that allows you to eliminate chances for the other team but it also allows you to create opportunities from other team mistakes and that's how that's how the team has has once the the number of games that they have this year I'm so it's it's the right plan for this league\nIs the right plan for this league and uh you know the guys and Anthony and the staff has been rewarded by our first ever playoff\nSpot to sort of first ever playoff spot we're going to have to wait till tomorrow to find out where that will be we have to any or is in the water to too many ...\nThe sitter tell your debt for definitely where we're going what time we're playing what night were playing 'cause I think I [noise] when we were in Phoenix they were saying that they were going to host a friday night game so we notice\nWe're going west were gone west to work at a place somewhere which\nBrings me to this point look a little forward to it we don't know who they opponents going to be so style play can't\nWhat you're on the road you will play a playoff game differently than you would regular season game when you're on the road [noise] well [noise] soccer\nGames single elimination turn out to be one of two ways and they can stick and go back and forth on the course of the game either they're ultra conservative which we saw a lot of tonight or they get so open\nThat it's like watching for before hockey you know whatever they call it foresight hockey where it just goes back and forth and back and forth and you see a line of players in the front and a half and a line of ... and again just flies in between them\nSo it's really just depends on what the moment is like\nNot necessarily what the tactical approach of the coaches are of the team just what the moment is like who has free space and uh what the guy initiates on the ball and how he wants to try to get after but\nYou'll see it both ways you saw it in the world cup you see it in the ambulance playoffs it's either really conservative or both teams will really good after it and you got to start working on handled it well let's go back one step okay that was my next okay let's go back once said if it's Phoenix\nYou better hope it's conservative because if it's open there's no way to put on your track shoes are bringing Hussein bowl Tucson and Australia by the way right now by and sees his doodle\nDon and Australia by the way right now sees his doodle three good saying it on loan um but uh yeah so if it's if it's Phoenix then you want to you want to try to slow the game down a case for sure yeah I Know how you're going to deal with that you're you're going to be prepared for that the best way you can but it's hard to uh\nIt's hard to mimic that in a in the course of training or when you're talking about pressure of the moment and that sort of\nThing that Barry joins us here I think he's got a smile on his congratulations I didn't smile pillows over well you smiled\nWhen San Antonio gave up a goal I\nDo yeah a graduating senior this franchise qualifies for the playoffs so the first time I'm Jeremy this in the pregame show I like to get your thoughts\nThe whole day just put it in perspective what it means because you start out you know you're having your biggest crowd you know if you get done what you need to you're in the play offs and what is taking place around the the whole ... of soccer in St Louis this week is pretty tremendous right now\nIt's hard to imagine it being a whole lot better right with everything that happened this week as you said and so [noise]\nYou know I uh it it's great for the fans really just to be out there and watch them sure you guys got to see it too and and just see how excited they are um ... that's what it's all about and and I know the south and the players are to obviously but it's been a great week um but hopefully this is just the beginning\nCut a lot of soccer left we were just talking about they also do get start practicing penalty kicks in a few other than that because you're going in the playoffs you know had now will be up by two in each game one on the road that every time it will say that every time you watch the scoreboard like we were upstairs sure\nYeah one of the apps picking me every time something happened and every time I was standing next to Tom struck did you get an alert alert you know so uh yeah ... unfortunately for San Antonio first of all there are a great organization to be honest I was pulling for them that we got our result and they got there's\nUm so I think a lot of things have to go their way here to get in which is fortunate but uh yeah great and I\nYeah I mean they would have to show up would have to loose morals and uh and then I think San Antonio would be in so we'll hope for that and I'm not I'm not ashamed to say\nThat no San Antonio is a great organization um and I hope they get in the crowd while\nEver I walked in I there's just people on top of people on top of the four which was which was great and wish we could have gotten my goal in a way in which I think would have been the only thing we could have done to make it better but most people here in New what\nWhat was sick so and I think that the good thing we we comment about it when we're sitting here before games it was good to see some of your faces back in the stadium sometimes you do see new faces which is always good but it's always good to see people that have come back now because of the interest in and what have you because you get to see those familiar faces again\nI think so I think people started to realize what was at stake tonight and and it brought some some familiar faces out and uh to to be around in the community in the last few days in here people really understand what we needed a winter to tie going into the week and then just to tie tonight I'm that's what it's all about and people get excited about it and that's why we do this\nHe had a group speaking of fan she got a group that\nEvery night you know it could be probably it was the first two games where it's thirty degrees it can be a hundred and eight heat index when we play in the middle of August with their hair every night that's what that's the backbone of what you filter with this group but that's that's pretty awesome see\nNight after night to see some of those people just continue to pour out here\nYou know I think it started from the very first game and and and guys like Dale who helped build this [noise] you know uh people are just connected to this and and we you know we you always want more fans but the ones we have are so passionate and so appreciative I mean there's people crying down in the corner tonight after the game and the you know just so\nLoving every minute of it and and and those are the people that have gotten us through and and I hope they're really enjoying\nIt wasn't ... filled up here when they were celebrating there's plenty of beer and there\nAre so each season starts in the middle of February for crying out loud it's snow on the ground from time to time and here tonight on October Thirteen\nSt Louis fc closes out the regular season and you get to play another week\nThis season uh in Germany and I joke about it it feels like a marathon now I feel like when we got in the league deal I don't know how you feel about it it just felt a lot shorter the differences only three or four weeks but pre season is longer now the seasons longer\nUm obviously playing now makes you happy you want to be playing at this time of the year right ah but it it is a grind and its grind on the players and grind on the coaches right on the staff but\nI get to the end of the season at this point and you have results like this it's all worth it\nYou know the good thing is we bought another week which means another week for Kyle another week for wall to\nMaybe get healthier and and uh hopefully hopefully get their their legs underneath them so they can help contribute next week is it a Friday Saturday or do we know\nIt depends what I've heard is um Phoenix would be friday everybody else will be Saturday a I don't know if I was supposed to say that are not like that I asked you asked I answered the rumor has the rumor has it sit next friday everybody else Saturday So\nThere's you know the game's going on now Portland Phoenix and that'll have a bearing on where we end up going so [noise] um yeah I mean it's getting those two guys back would be huge because\nI think what we've seen this week is where a different scene with them\nFor sure but I think it's I think I'm Still trying to figure out the website but to me it feels like it's either Orange County or Phoenix I see us coming seventh or eighth um and uh I don't think we can change that\nCause Portland has more wins and us and Orange County or Phoenix and and it's just a matter of who ends up but I even then I think Orange County is in automatically Big M\nBecause even a Phoenix wins tonight and ends up was sixty six points Orange County has beat 'em on gold different\nCorrect but I I thought I had it not good at my math wrong Portland loses tonight I think we beat them oh so I think we finish insects and we play Sacramento if if the Knicks can be Portland\nWell as my math wrong no I think first the first time director is wins and Portland has sixteen winds are fourteen [noise]\nWe might have a math argument here I'm not a hundred percent oh we don't do you what was Portland on fifty two points going in and that's where that's where I get confused alive alive update on the on those kinds of things so Phoenix to pull it off for say it's a new map that gets me\nThat the new math I'd be fine I Wish the teachers you know but you know at this point I Know it's easy to say but I'm just glad we're in but now I'm selfish and greedy and\nI Want to finish six and I want to go play Sacramento so exactly right that's that's a hundred percent where we want to go that's\nThat's exactly right well I'm Glad you cleared that up for me\nWhy to take off my shoes and we finally figured it out\nWell the celebration will continue if you're listening right now I can tell you season tickets for next year on sale\n[noise]\nThat was the passing down of the game for ... got a couple of games in a world without having one good to see him and I\nWas a freshman Jay Leno\nHas Missouri falls at Alabama thirty nine to end the tigers are three\nAnd three overall their own three in Southeastern Conference play what a convenient clip into our MA I trusted choice player of the game\nThat trusted George player of the game is brought you buy your local trusted choice with M. A. I. A. I'm going to give it to jail and knocks Kurdish because you look at the stat sheet and Missouri didn't get a lot of explosive play\nFrom its passing a more from the ... the the way that they defined it and the stat sheet that are generally take a look at say say your trunk play is again a Fifteen or more on off ended up passing game changer more\nIn the running gait Missouri had a couple of runs that went over ten yards a lot of it was more intermediate running in Alabama I thought that a really good job in this game of limiting a very good Missouri rushing attack but you had for passing\nPlays at Fifteen yards are more three of those Kurdish were completed\nTo Jane let knocks including that touchdown and two of them that one that you just heard and the one that was up to par sidelined during that Missouri long drive where they ended up punting from Alabama Territory there and the second quarter of those were both throws that get you to the NFL\nFor drew walk and for ... Knox those were both catches that gets you to the NFL someday if you continue like that he has a very promising young wide receiver and it was good to see him perform on that stage\nDumber called the little ... because he wears number not just like a Germany did he had some great catches he he missed another a opportunity for another big reception or ... or you could get his hands on it but\nHe replied really great football I'm Glad to see that come in and was able to uh pick up the slack for menu all about being able to play for the growing injury\nBut then also prayers go up to him and his family is probably unexpectedly passed away so he was with his family had Nashville or this week just she wasn't going to be able to play any way so per route to his family and we can get them back healthy or for the second stretches season and we're going to we need to help out with the hope\nIt is definitely there and certainly our thoughts and prayers go out to Manuel and his family but at the time he does get healthy that Emanuel hall and maybe even jailing knocks on the other side and it looks like two weapons that you can take into SEC play and say we'll send our two out there with the best of yours and see what we come up with with the quarterback\nWe all go back in touch all the new richer rule 'cause I don't know if the box was assaulted decision going into the season of yes he is definitely going to play or if it was he's a twin or let's play the first three or four games to see what you're going to do but\nHe earned himself a big opportunity and ... on the team for the whole season instead of taking the red shirt\nAnd I'm I'm Glad he did it take a choice themselves to say no I Want a red shirt because I heard her some guy I think there was a pretty wide receiver to Oklahoma State that was a true freshman played in the first four games and said oh what a red shirt that are playing so\nGood and bad but I think it's definitely a very good rule of those young guys covered it gets a place in the first three or four games to see what they're going to be at if we're going to help the team that have experienced\nGoing into the second half of the season\nAnd drew locks assignment didn't this game we know is difficult it goes Thirteen of twenty six in the ballgame just one hundred and forty two yards passing a touchdown he throws two interceptions wasn't there at the end where it's at a fourth and for situation inside the tent and he's just trying to throw it away and you can get it up on it the first of those interceptions of the game\nWas a pretty good play by Alabama to be honest with you they must have read something that said they'll try to get their tied in with a ... because I say be Smith rent or read it really well for drew in this game you saw the moments that were definitely highlights but you also thought moments where he was hurried where he was rushed were protection broke down reflect the pocket a little bit early\nHe just kind of feels like right now after the stretch\nWhat fans would want to see from drew was again that is more consistent and more confident like we saw at the beginning of the season and I think hopefully for the tigers they have an opportunity to do that against Memphis getting back to the friendly confines at Memorial stadium next week\nOh definitely I that's I think uh you you definitely echoed I'm sick and we just want to see ... or another you know complete game\nOr or is accurate the football where he made good decisions um that's gone picking up the receiver and also throwing the football away at the time when they need to get in a rush to nobody's opened instead of trying to extend the play and make something happen but who voted for him to get back on track and have a good complete game coming up this weekend he'll have\nQuite the opportunity against the Memphis Tigers who you heard earlier and Mike mentioned it on the broadcast they had a lead against you see at the chance for nationally ranked win and then central Florida came back\nAnd they won that game thirty one to thirty so Memphis is licking their wounds today as well as the battle the tigers will be in the

Thirteen ... it's an area in which fans always have that debate if you're in the opponents territory in college football what do you do and when do you do what I what why do you look at that as a player as somebody who's on the field in the middle of that one\nOr do you have a preference or do you just go and say okay we're just going to go get them the next time or we're going to execute whatever were asked to execute\n[noise] at that point in the field or or you just had some ... I Want to say what I think I Would have done it I think I'm gonna say why coach showed him did what he did [noise] I'm surprised coach showed him did what he did because there's been times so pretty much all along that same position he goes for it [laughter]\nUm you know going forward over the wet however you want to stay at a\nI think he did it I think he went ahead and kicked it there because\nWell we just gave up or down at a field goal in a pretty short amount of time but Israel by Seventeen must try and put them deeper defense have been playing pretty good I think that's why punted it I'm surprised though because they have gone for numerous times the running game was looking good and you're on the forty seven as what I say we're all looked at and talked about was okay\nWe've got a net part of a thirty three yards and\nHow many times when you talk about choked plays to chart players and you're there um Alabama burned you on a couple of players already and it just took them I think three or four plays to get past the forty seven yard lie to the way the first and then the picked up\nThe Missouri Arkansas and Vanderbilt all the only teams without a league when\nI go on a limb and saying the way that this has gone so far this season and how close teams if Ben\nYou're not going to see anybody sitting like Tennessee was last year it overnight you're going to have your opportunity to make your move and form Missouri that opportunity starts not just with Memphis on homecoming and taking care of business at a non conference games but right out of the gate you have a chance to prove something against the Kentucky Wildcats at your place that's going to be a very big game and two weeks dots\nThat very well should be in a I think we stand it when you to come out next week ... we've got a place\nVery well should be in a I think we stand it when you to come out next week we've got to play a clean football game that's what I Want to see next week it was a you know no turnovers merely creates them turnovers on defense in love with the penalties cause it's still too many pills to tonight a crucial times\nOf it and luckily the targeting called it was bogus they got reviewed all stopped talking about that we have dress all back and started this game because I happen to the first house so we just had to miss the second half of the games to have him

the big five fifty would\nCrystal clarity wherever you go\nGet it how to get the\nThe world you are this is the best of Katy our ass\nSpeaking of the White House in our president or he recently held a a roundtable discussion\nIn the wake of the Florida shooting regarding a video games of violent video games and what impact if any they may be having on our youth and or their behavior\nAnd one of the individuals who was called to for that meeting was our next guest his name is Dr Douglas genteel he's a professor of psychology at Iowa State and Doug thanks for taking the time to join us here on the big five fifty K. C. R. S.\nOh it's my pleasure although I should clarify that I was uninvited audited by that meeting\nA which I guess suggest that the media industry I\nThink I'm too dangerous to go no I'm Sorry I got I got well\nBut you're one of those who feels that that the video games can certainly add too aggressive behavior amongst our young is it are you is that in my\nYeah see I think the way you're praising it is really very important that\nTalking there there's a difference between the aggressive behavior\nAnd violence yes and\nThat's an important difference aggression is much broader aggression can be physical can be verbal it can be relational where you're like me reuse your relationship to harm someone like giving them the cold shoulder a if\nA whereas violence is physical only added severe it's really extreme such that if successful it would cause severe bodily damage our debt\nSo it's a really narrow and extreme some type of aggression and there is a lot of research on not just video games with other media TV and movies going back to their Nineteen sixties that does show that their kids to watch a lot of media violence\nDo become more willing to behave aggressively wedding provoked and that's a really different thing from saying the school shootings jak often the way it is a this gets their own misinterpreted or in the public domain\nBut if they are more aggressive as a result of their exposure to these games are and they tend to be\nConfrontational and or your ... your correct me if I'm mis categorized that but what we might call troublemakers or problems\nOr or have issues a debt aggressiveness couldn't be act it out in in sometimes violent behavior or at least a you know ... if nothing else they get they get in fights or something like that for\nSure and I think that you know the thing to remember is often when there's been a terrible tragedy\nI think the you know the thing to remember is often when there's been a terrible tragedy\nUh like like the Florida shooting\nWe we often asked the wrong question we ask them what ... what was the cause of this and the minute we asked a question we're already barking at the wrong tree because there's never a single cause for most human behaviors especially not want as complicated\nAs aggression because we're we're more complicated than that we don't do things just for one reason or and the you know the U.S surgeon general's report on youth violence actually documents about a hundred scientifically known risk factors for aggression\nMedia violence is just one of them it's and it's not the biggest uh it's right in the middle it's kind of about the same size is coming from a broken home and we all know people who came from broken homes who never do anything seriously aggressive\nBut that's different from saying it had no effect it still was a risk for them [laughter] animal early\nYou know consuming a lot of meat or violence or playing a lot of video games or most people I Would never do anything seriously aggressive which is still a different thing from saying it's having no effect in fact if you ask of our game or why are they like to play it\nOr they'll tell you they liked the adrenalin rush right when they are exactly right it is a ... a gentleman and or adrenaline and quarters on testosterone these are the so called stress hormones those are the same cocktail hormones\nThat you would drop into your bloodstream if I punched you right now which is really interesting you know it's just a game but your body is treating it like a real fight that's the effect it's actually preparing you for aggression\nAnd [laughter] and gamers like that feeling a ... which is fair because normally when you've got that cocktail for most of your bloodstream you're not enjoying what's going on [laughter]\nWell and there's also a certain people are in the population that it could be addicted to that kind of adrenalin rush in need that kind of adrenalin rush act\nThe top
