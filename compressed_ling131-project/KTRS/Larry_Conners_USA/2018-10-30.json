catch up on a couple of things that crazy us the fight this weekend\nUm and then um what was it was uh what was his name\nConor McGregor that was the pre limb but the craziest fight was a bad way one no I'm a judge Kavanaugh versus oh\nThat was that one was crazy talk or do we have ... hey Nick Pope is is with us how are you this evening misspoke thank you very much\nYou I'm a A R a celebrity I'm no doubt you used to run the British government's UFO project\nI'm you are the world's leading expert on UFOs you were an author a consultant you've consulted on movies and TV shows in video games um your the person to go to when it comes to UFOs how\nDid they not be but as a government job bike in the u._k.\nLet's start right there was pope because I don't know that many people I don't know anybody else who's ever said you know I ran a a government UFO project you used to run the British Government UFO project talk about what that entails [noise]\nWhile we were the chair my job was to investigate them\nWith evidence of any kind of the United kingdom defense scientific and try to do that to handle the on the subject I Want to go when they came to the media\nNow you left that job in two thousand and six and they've been doing other things since one of the things that you've been working on\nHis to declassify the some of the documents from the u._k. project this is a more general question which is why the governments like the u._k. like the United states ... why did they try to keep UFO information hidden\nWell see I don't think like the ability of tree radar systems like it can leave we don't go to any of these things in a way and\nThat that would help taught science technology medicine the environment almost every aspect of our lives might be touched by this\nYeah I I guess so I Want to switch gears here real quickly ... because I'm this moves to what I think is your next area of expertise to one I Believe in UFOs that just never been visited by one and I'm I'm starting to feel left out the never taking me on the ship and done whatever they do with their probes but\nWe can get it\nBut you are also well known a conspiracy theories and again the numbers Ninety nine five eight seven seven to ... years and they were one to six\nA new pope with the conspiracy theories that drives me crazy right now and that's not because I I don't find them entertaining and I don't find them some time\nThat I agree with them but for the most part I Want to pull my hair I was little I had left trying to explain to people that\nUm you know nine eleven was not an inside job and you cannot keep thousands if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people quiet when they're the mere fact that they speak out would be worth millions and millions of dollars to them\nYou know um it's been a lot of time looking you conspiracy theories and I'd love to hear your take on them\nWhy I agree with you I get frustrated too I think it goes to the heart to some interesting things about the psychology of belief\nThat one thing that I think run through a lot of conspiracy theory shots Mr Trump if the government [laughter] every now and then absolutely of course a conspiracy theory will turn out to be true for example people forget that the government secretly reading all our emails\nAnd they don't come along and said wait\nA minute they they probably are seems seems we were right but they all the other thing nine eleven the moon landing mat and hold I kind of stuff I think it's just\nIt's chip between science fiction and paranoia and evidently you can look at a lot of these things and prove them just by critical thinking and basic science for example when the ... went to the moon the laughter effect to that\nSort of a science lab can fire a laser at this thing at all found can you can measure the distance between the U.S on the moon down to the ... millimeter well obviously that put the thing up there and set it up in the first place you know\nWhy is it than that so many people want so desperately to believe that we for example didn't go to the moon than ah the United states and um you know\nAnd then the the Jewish people not the Jewish people de ... Jews created nine eleven why do people want to believe that\nI think psychology is still trying to figure it out psychology psychiatry so I mean it's it's the human mind is I suppose\nPretty much the most difficult thing to understand we don't really know but but again I think he has to do with some sort of um the hearings deep deep seated trying to\n... um that that must be something going on behind people's backs that they got\nI think they Powell ... is a part of it people feel that the power then that that this thing more that they can't see they truck these great full now ships and unfortunately the Internet these things to spread out of control\nWhat do you have to say about those folks and I won't even use his name we all know who he is um been him monetize it just really almost destructive conspiracy theories out there on the Internet\nI think it was time something like that it's quite\nQuite cynical and it just to [noise] uh I think the the is the paranoia or people in a very real sense I think it's\nGoing to offend a lot of these people have been occasions where people have kind of weapons and gone and shot a pizza parlors because they think that that they're at the center of some nefarious government conspiracy involving\nTrial sexual trafficking and the thoughts of things that dark side to all of this you mentioned the point about the Jewish question there's no getting away from the fact that the\nOn the healthy streak of anti Semitism running through a lot of these conspiracy theories when people use phrases like small group of um an international family secretly ruling the ... the global banking conspiracy on what they really mean is cheers\nRight right um you also I've written a number of things that you've written you've indicated studies have shown that people are likely to believe conspiracy theories are likely to bully irreconcilable versions of the same so for a job\nI Can't remember the the example you use but I'm saying you know the nine eleven either slow I'm Sorry to take the shooting in Connecticut for example that the government did they will put on by the government the school shooting\nFor that it didn't even occur and all that just didn't believe both of those and yet the India reconcilable\nI mean again it's just a clue that there is like your pathology play with some of this\nBelief and of course the conspiracies about the the school shootings for example in the\nSpring shooting up beyond insulting I mean I can imagine the greed of the parents and then right to be told on the Internet that that they're all part of a cone being traded on on the community and they didn't really lose that that capital\nWell beyond a reprehensible\nRight absolutely but what how do you explain to folks the new pope that I'm a bit of good friends did you believe in these conspiracy theories and and again I Try not to to judge too much scratch my head with them because they're good friends as opposed to pulling out my hair\nBut how do you go to them and say scientifically this just can't happen logically it can happen how do you address those when you around speaking\nJust can't happen logically it can happen how do you address those when you're out speaking to groups are reading your articles\nVery difficult to call conspiracy theory you will never watch them because\nIf somebody comes and tries to explain something they'll they'll just keep on anyway\nYeah they don't believe you work for the the government are trying to hide UFOs though I\nI mean you go on the Internet and they go where they live in architecture catcher shift to call the police but there are people in the middle I think if you could\nGauge with them and say look at the source of information for poll with the moon landing to the living room that I mentioned the\nNine eleven commission report that many people that talk about the nine eleven commission report\nShut lightning sure [noise] um and again I always get back to the point on nine eleven on on a ... a on the moon landing\nAgain besides the conspiracy we can't even keep what is published in an FBI report about judge Kavanaugh quiet for more than sixty minutes after its release\nIt they're going to keep a conspiracy the sides of JFK or nine eleven or any of these others quiet in Washington it it makes no sense\nNo it it seems to be on breaking point\nYeah Nicole ... a fascinating stuff and thank you so much for joining us where are you in addition to Nick poll dot net where else can people find you read you and and and learn more about you\nWhat was going to stop but I just put out a DVD code to go on if people want to\nTalk about the the together Gramm metal thing my brother and again on Amazon\nWhile Nick Pope Nicole thank you so much for being with\nYou but I'm All right there you go everything you wanted to know about UFOs and conspiracy theories I just I don't believe that uh\nHis name or killed uh JFK by himself but then you're Harvey Oswald yeah yeah that's him now\nBeyond that I think there was probably a couple of guys maybe there were involved oh yeah but beyond a couple of guys know that we didn't have all of the secret service and the CIA\nAnd Johnson and and my friend Bryan Sexton would go crazy and say I don't get it and I I'm not naive\nBut um no we need the Harvey Oswald could not fire off three shots could do it but the government could not keep anything more than a couple of three guys quiet for more you're listening to the\nBest of all access on the big five fifty kick your ass\n[noise] eating you connect to the St Louis and the world cited Katie our actions are\nNow this is a restaurant started how far back does it start with your grandparents my grandmother\nYeah and I am twenty
