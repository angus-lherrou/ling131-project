came across this and again but friday's arts so much for politics but this one this one falls into the fun or um amusement category and the president was talking about climate change\nAnd I was the first one to say I don't have a buffet arms around the whole issue of climate change right\nI Know it appears from everything I can tell that something's going on now what the reason for that is I'm listening to scientist I Believe scientists most Ninety seven percent of the scientists give a\nPretty good explanation nearby you know I I was still wait and see I my wife spends a lot of time her parents spent a lot of the they're just people that are much better on this than I Am gay but I'll be the first to admit that\nThat I'm just that's where I'm at now um [noise]\nHere's what the president here's how the president explains it just cracks me up how I'm the president can claim um knowledge ... claim or the ability\nWhere uh you know how we're absolutely zero exists okay I'll tell you I don't know\nI just will but here he is talking about climate change your choices I agree the climate changes but it goes back and forth back and forth when the press or the interviewer noted that scientists have concluded otherwise\nTrump asserted his own scientific credentials okay so he says okay\nWith it [laughter] okay on boy do get I and\nSo he had to here is that just so we've set this up uh he says climate change it's just one of these cyclical things that are goes back and forth and the interviewer says but scientists say that's not true and he says well let me tell you why I Know I'm right my uncle\nWas a great professor at MIT for many years Dr John from\nAnd I didn't talk to him I didn't talk to him about this particular subject but I have a natural instinct for science that I Will say that you have scientists and both sides of this picture\nSo apparently Donald Trump is an expert on climate change because his uncle John was an MIT professor doesn't even say what he did he was just a professor and therefore President Trump has a natural instinct\nFor science ... there you go I mean how do you argue with that [noise] that's that's a tough one when you go with that\nI you know again and on the street [laughter]\nI mean I suppose you know even if your uncle um I was a Aaron Rodgers you could say you know\nI never played a day of football in my life but I can tell you how to play quarterback because my uncle my uncle Aaron Rodgers who I'd never met that never talked to about football he was a quarterback and therefore my natural instincts are as a quarterback\nGone looking forward to riding in a plane and then you know they can ask\nMe is there a pilot on board and I said well my grandfather Yellowstone an airplane\n[noise] [laughter] oh gosh it just I don't even know what how do you respond to that again\nWhy can't somebody just simply simply Internet like off well turned his Mica against people sue again we all talk and talk and talk um and that's what we do want to talk radio that's what I Do but at least on occasion I Will say um this is something I I don't know about\nAnd I'm not going to lie to you [noise] um but uh apparently that doesn't matter a Mitt Griffin is with us Nick we'll ask him what his uncle did in ... in life and therefore what he has a natural instinct for Nick Griffin is [noise]\nThis system mildly um well it's kind of adult feelings like a you know I talk a lot about that a lot but I talk a little bit about depression and\nBeing an adult to trying to get through stuff and things not being as great as you think they're going to be but it's all really funny and I also talk a lot about relationships which I haven't been able to pull off the um to any great degree up to this point\nIs that because of the comedy on the road the reason I\nThink a lot of it is I think a lot of it is that it has to do with me being way too focused on comedy I'm not focused enough on the other person and you know I'm trying to get better at that uh but again I'm so excited about my work and I had such a it's\nGiven me such you know pleasure and sometimes the relationships is much harder for me I don't know just not as good at it so I tend to go where the going is good\nWhat would you do if you weren't doing comedy if you weren't I mean obviously you love it there that are you you hate it so much you're going to beat it I don't\nKnow what [laughter] so that's a that's a different way of looking at yeah I think well I think on\nSome level the second one was what I was doing when I was young I was so hard that I was like I Can't let this beat me you know difficult to be a great at it I mean I think it's it's it's hard to be good at it but to be great at it as just ridiculously hard and um\nAnd I think that uh I got past that point and now I feel like I'm a I Love it you know I still get excited after Thirty years I still get a little nervous before I'd gone I still have my little notes\nUh before I go on I still have a little pad of paper that I have two or three new jokes every night when I Try to really try him out yeah\nNow that I think that's different that you actually try out new material all the time I mean every night that they care I'm going to write new material avenue special coming out from going back on the road\nYeah try new stuff every night yeah what what do you ... when there I Do have one\nHere let me see was a well no I just said that uh I was talking about ice cream and how you can enjoy it as an adult and then I said but you have to get I'm not sure where you can as an adult you know ice cream candy naps be or you know\nIt's like a ... or ... [noise] I don't really\nLike a kindergarten nurse with a drinking\nProblem and [noise] so that's that worked out the first show and I'm hoping to pull it off the rest of the show is comedy it changed and you're Thirty years\nYeah I think it's gotten so much into marketing and Twitter and Instagram that you\nReally it's so crucial and I'd never been able to\nI just have not done the due diligence of that stuff um I haven't put enough effort and time into getting a lot of Twitter followers but so many of these comedy clubs depend on audience members and if you have a hundred thousand or you know Twitter ... it'd be better chance that you're getting I looked and they're taking up a lot of sludge\nWhat about topics do you think that um what people are doing out there on social media or on the Daily Show or on all the various\nUm you know taught our called talk shows where you calling in and the rest rooms that um that it's changed what people are doing for comedy is comedy still comedy if it's funny it's funny I think it's\nPretty um uh comedy is comedy but there's still some you know guys who you know my skirt\nThe edges of uh of trying to be edgy and and maybe it's a little bit harder to be edgy now super edgy um or you know we're talking about subjects that people are much more sensitive about now um I've never been that guy that I'm\nSuper edgy uh I'm you know I I'm a comedy club nightclub comics so I'm trying to make as many friends friends as possible and ah\nDo you think guys like a Carlin um you know some of the others I'm Lenny Bruce ... how do you think they do today in this kind of more PC focused world\n... yeah I think that um I got to meet 'em George Carlin briefly and he just came across to me like a hyper intellectual I mean I just think he would do great in any\nIn any era he was so smart and um I got to open for he was um working his newest our ended up being as last hour at the comedy magical I've been in outside of LA and yeah it was to be yeah\nAnd I was a regular there and so they said hey you want to come down open for Carlin my almost started crying and I got down there he wanted the green room to himself and which was fine he and I got to open form and then he did the show and then I was walking down the hallway after the show\nAnd he had a bunch of 'em well wishers after the show who we are talking to him and he pushed through the well wishers and he came up to me and he said jeeze I just wanted to tell you thank you so much for opening for me I'm Sorry I had the green room to myself I'm Still trying to memorize the um\nYou know the script and I just wanted to say thank you and I was like oh my gosh this is the\nNicest however due to me and that and then they tell he wasn't kidding like he was such a genuine tell sincerity happy sail nonsense and bullshit and he had a\n... and I know you have a show at second show you're at the comedy club let's get you a feud or additional lives Instagram guys fish followers give us all your social media\nComedian named Griffin on Facebook and the Nick Griffin on Twitter and I don't have an Instagram and\nI have one but I don't know how to get your mic Griffin thanks so much thank you so much it's nine forty five all access we'll be right back\n[noise] and [noise]\nSaid [noise]\n\nWe\nKnew\nThe\nWeekend at home or a weekend or being cutting the grass or betting on new\nListening to make and friar standing in line at a restaurant\nDuring at your neighbor security lights are counting stars\nWatching the travel channel or sitting around the campfire with friends\nBreak away get out of town and an already from my early in eureka\nWireless was Fifteen minutes ... by two Seventy five forty four in eureka\nHey there's guy pull ups the home improvement project you've been putting off and wait any longer right now at universal windows directed by one window you get one free no limits\nZero percent financing for thirty six months is available\nGet free instantly universal ... three one forty seven eight zero three Harvard for universal windows at St Louis dot ...\nLike me you're saying I Love my windows\nUniversal windows direct\nUniversal windows direct\nStewart Rosenberg I'm president of the stores America Morgan Stanley mortgages are the biggest investment that a person is going to make in their life\nYet most people don't know anything about it in tune in for mortgages and more which doing that's me where we can go all the different types of mortgage programs in simple terms human hilly you become an expert after the first show listened to mortgages it more with Julie at its new time Sunday mornings at night I Am on K T.

cruiser yeah there it is\nI'm ... and uh had one you did mhm how was it and I had\nThe first year would they came out what what do you think I thought it was okay though I didn't like was when they made the PTA cruiser convertibles a because those are just stupid look here's\nWhat they said is whether I think that the consumer affairs when they were in the car tries to kill me literally it shuts off for no reason at anytime Seventy five miles an hour down the interstate alarm goes off for no reason all hours foreign honk for no reason while driving any of those problems are a number okay\nI'm now here we go number three worst scars pinto\nOther than its exploding burst into flames yeah you don't remember this the meaning they built it with the back of the gas tank right in the back of the car a picture of right there so there's the ... into the gas tank was back here if you were rear ended in ... into your car exploded loaded\nGod yeah uh so apparently and testing the pinto Fort crashed it more than forty times at speeds of more than twenty five miles per hour or the fuel tank ruptured every time they did it\nAnd yet they put out in the market anyway says the first time some love for just did it every day\nI'm here's the number two worst card again of foreign the Austin the leg grill yeah so now here's what I was talking about Ross in terms of at least on this is from the drive\nAnd its opinion obviously this guy's got his opinion as to the worst cars he says the number one worse car with the Nineteen Seventy eight Cadillacs a day and the ...\nIt was that puts us a Danville on here for personal reasons it was certainly a hideous and over long kitten bucket and it got six miles to the gallon\nWhich didn't fit in to Jimmy Carter's gas crisis America knew refill values fell through the floor which is why my grandfather was able to buy a lime green one for one hundred dollars a few years after it had been released\nUm was yeah it was created yeah I'm so let me just hop over to one other list I'm On the kind of take a look at those direct\nDid not have votes wagon this thing [laughter] that's a great the remember the thing yes a Volkswagen the thing that was it kind of cool that was different\nAnd that was a convertible remember when convertibles were illegal you would not make a convertible in this country for many years and um I don't know when that changed well as they are even mean danger of the you know we have to convert we'll flip silver in\n... yeah they didn't have any uh any safety features that that kept your head and being in the asphalt\nNo yeah that's why they're so um the core mayor that's another one wherever that was cool yeah but that was another death trap and another one of those cars that exploded what was that was what made what's his name\nUh that consumer rights guy a Ralph Nader pat unsafe at any speed and that was his first uh is first what\nUh let's see the ... on this guy's list these names to scramble an was cool you know here's one that I'm going to absolutely agree with the love bear and remember that the two door hard top that was a sweet\nSweet thing got in trouble a lot of little burns\nA lot

can be weird that like deja vu humiliation down the stairs right right or do I guess if you enjoyed thrown at her right I mean not\nBut there are people that do enjoy playing and sort of the dominant submissive way where\nMaybe one person is sort of more in the dominant role and his guiding more of what is going on or sort of having more of like that from stance on things\nThere's also arguments do that from the submissive side of things you are basically relinquishing control but you do ultimately hold sort of the the ultimate get out of jail free card because if you sort of say for it out or if you you know an Anna yeah right [laughter] fully edge you know whatever whatever that maybe if you say that then you're basically ending thing\nAnd it's an it's an agreed upon thing so when we talk about consent there is what is known as consensual non consent you have a conversation before you ever get into a sexual setting and you decided ahead of time what the limits are\nWho's going to do what and how it's going to go um and and you also agree upon the rules of like if I say to say for it or if you know I say read that means we're done you agree on those things I don't know about all of the cases that you're talking about like was everyone on a an agreement well that's what I'm doing where\nAre you probably most people are not educated like you have a study did you begin to head down a road experiment and right and what you hear as it was um you know consensual gone bad sheriff and then all of a sudden the gal comes out looking like it'd be the heck out of her\nRight and I would say that's not that is not being practiced in there there's like a ... you want to keep in mind is it safe sane and consensual so are we playing\nWith like the same parameters that we're talking about like is everybody on the same page or we all in our you know a right frame of mind that's the same heart or we you know intoxicated or not\nKnow things like that are we having a mentally you know difficult day like are we in our right frame of mind to do this\nAnd then up so stay sane and consensual would be the third piece saying is everybody on this is everybody's saying yes to what is it her once you start to experiment so anybody that might be listening and go okay well I don't want to play dangerously but maybe I Want to experiment\nStarting small is really a good idea like you don't necessarily want to go and you know try everything in one day that you've ever imagined try that a lot to fry it and so you kinda want to start with like maybe one small something and see how it goes\nAnd go from there there there are a lot of resources that exist at the national coalition for sexual freedom is actually a really great resource ah you can read all about the ideas of safe than a consensual but they also have resources to people all over the country\nIt is safe than a consensual but they also have resources to people all over the country not just like myself but like therapist and psychiatrist and lawyers and doctors in any type of medical practitioner you can basically imagine that is open minded that will help you through some of these things that you may have questions about depending on what the questions are you know interesting it's a really cool resource\nAh let me switch gears talking about the lawyer so the legal side so are we going to take a break our to our topic is so you're going to come back\nI Want to know the good side a little bit of the legal side I mean are we at that point in um relationships where we need to as Dave Chappelle

on what is called consent\nTea and I know that sounds crazy but it really explains the whole concept of consent really well because it basically uses the analogy that if let's\nSay for instance you came over to my house and I decided to make key for us and you know I don't really want tea\nAnd I decided to make you T anyway and then once I make the tea I didn't force you to drink that the ...\nYou know point it said you wanted to be and in fact it was on me because I'm the one forcing it down your throat basically it it goes into more detail than that without ... recreating the entire seven minute clip I'll just say that that's basically the same because ... is really not that hard it's really not\nIn the person that you are engaging with\nConscious and able to be involved in the activity what they are it's no fun so then that would be a whole slew of things that we are talking about yeah so it's like it's really it's not that hard line agree with you so yeah that's the first one as Bill Cosby is you're\nRight I mean it's like it it it it's crazy to me how it seems as though this gets blown out of proportion like well how do I know it's OK well\nDid they at any point give you an indication that they wanted this did you just check was like\nAre you good were dead right like it's not that hard to to at least have a little bit of human decency to just check on the person
