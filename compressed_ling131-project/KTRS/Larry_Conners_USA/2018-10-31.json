to eliminate it will ah amend the constitution just like we did a with prohibition and you know drinking yes drinking women voting all the different things that we have over the years that's that's how you um\nChanged the constitution you don't do it with an executive order 'em and and and the president [noise]\nAh I I just don't know why he is somebody should speak you know then again there was somebody along with him that was off the side as the documentary was being filmed there was running around looking for the fuse boxes\nAnd or or or the plug on the lights of the camera tiny yanking say what happened a few blocks went out to the camera went down I uh\n[noise] um I mean but again it's back to this issue this divisive issue of immigration\nEveryone agrees that immigration is an issue we have lots of people coming to this country we've had lots of people come to this country for a hundreds of years and it's clear that the way the system is set up right now I Need some fixing\nI agree I also agree that we have Fifteen million people you know at a minimum in this country that have been here for a many many many many many years that have raised families here that have businesses here that of pay taxes their entire life here\nWe had to do something with those folks were not there is no way to round them up put them on greyhound buses and send them somewhere else it's just we can't be done\nWe have a way of processing those that caravan it's a group of people that are seeking asylum here you they they may have to stand in line for six months\nThat are seeking asylum here they they may have to stand in line for six months at the border if that's what they want to do to get their appointment in line to seek asylum\nUm you know that's up to them\nBut that's the way our laws are written if people end up here to either the problem is for every one of these issues you end up hearing those stories so what you end up with is well you know in in foreign countries what they do is they have a citizenship vacations\nSo they wait I'm somebody will get pregnant\nOr they will then come to this country you know on vacation or a visa so that they can end up delivering here\nAnd then their child is a a U.S citizen and they'll say they plan it they pay for it okay yeah I bet there are some people out there that they do that\nYou know a larger percentage that is of the people born in this country\nEvery year\nLiterally ... nothing okay and it doesn't give the parents US citizenship the parents can't stay here\nSo they have to leave the baby behind\nIf they want to stay I mean if they want the citizens him to stay here or heard stay here ... they have to somehow attain citizenship they don't want to change that now than they call it a chain migration where but initially you know unless you're willing to just dumped a baby here\nOr I guess leave it with relatives are not leaving my baby behind I don't care for what reason [noise] so I mean people don't think this through and and you take the extreme you take the the story\nThe urban legend the odds happening everywhere it must be there must be one good zillion of bills every year\nOh no no no no\nAnd yet that's the kind of discussion we're having rather than having what is a rational reasonable\nDiscussion about immigration\nYou know why we don't do that because it's hard and you know what it's gonna take weeks if not months of sitting at a table and and hashing things out you know it's easy I'm just going to stop birthright citizenship with an executive order sixty seconds soundbite I'm gonna send five thousand troops to the border sixty seconds sound but\nI feel like nobody's ever told him no oh of course the hip and then he fired you're fired [laughter] you're

piece here on the big five fifty Katie RS\nWelcome back to all access and this is Jay cancer\nHalloween is right around the corner and one of the places that has lots of interesting sometimes scary in our minds a creepy crawly things is the St Louis ... it'd be blue in the zoo is going on now through Halloween\nAnd so we thought it would be interesting to bring in someone who oversees the decree peace in the ... the things that we kinda shiver a little bit\nWhen we see Dr ... is the curator of invertebrates and he is the director\nFor the center of native pollinators conservation and one of the great things about the St Louis zoo is the insect Jerry um and a doctor a feedback works as part of the zoo in the insect Terry I'm welcome to the program\nThank you for having me so let's start um just to the definition of invertebrates\nInvertebrates are those animals are technically without back so vertebrates are the mammals birds reptiles amphibians fish\nI'm at a few other smaller groups which most people don't see it birds are most of life on the planet those things actually keep them a planet running those things which we cannot live without\n[noise] I guess to go all the way to the single ... are they invertebrates or if I go out to diagnose shutting\nTechnically you know they're not in ...\nAnd my God dang starting\nYeah technically you know they're not in verb it's a ... would have to be multi cellular okay maybe that they have more than one cell so ... see him tech or not read regarded as invertebrate\nSo would I say spiders and bugs who does that coverage generally as\nThough spiders insects slugs worm portrayals of a ... a jellyfish all those\nSorts of things All right so a lot of those can be found in the insect carry him down there at a at the zoo the really cool place um and I encourage everyone to get down there to kind of place where you want to see in sex no you want to see these insects how long has that been there and describe it a little bit\nSo we officially opened around two thousand so we're next year will be our nineteenth\nBeer and existence um we're actually rather unique because most visitors do nots exhibits invertebrates the way we do or they may have a couple of here and there we actually have a dedicated robots tarp and interpret staff\nSo we're actually one of the ... in the country which has a dedicated building staff education conservation and research effort is devoted to invertebrate so St Louis zoo is unique so that's another reason why you want to kind of called 'em and see the St Louis zoo because we are one of the few out there\nAnd then I said this before in the show in segments on the zoo in otherwise when you count on one hand the things that make St Louis great to St Louis zoo is one of them for many many reasons and as you just described this do is is unique and hence things that you won't find nearly anywhere else in the world\nWe're speaking with ... the curator of vertebrate tell us a little bit about some of the let's start with the Halloween e creepy crawly I Know you have some cockroaches down there and they had seen deterred a gas they looked like maybe I'm exaggerating but the signs of football's\nWell that is a bit of exaggeration actually that's\nActually very common with various fares so often times people will call up and say oh I've seen this cock roaches you said the size of a football\nGame of spider the size of a softball um we don't have those\nThings around here but fear tends to inflate it I remember as a kid remember saying I remember this patron at a three foot\nDusk well there is one unfortunately in an exotic species mosquito found around here the Asian Tiger which is active during the day so first off that spray won't do anything right secondly the sprays are contacts brave so it actually has to touch the mosquito\nWealth doesn't touch the mosquito is not going to do anything right but you also have to think about the other\nBees butterflies other beneficial insects which can be affected by those same insecticides\nIt's far more effective look at where those mosquitoes are laying their eggs so it's understanding their life cycle so we need to understand more and more about these species how they live and that's going to be much more effective at dealing with if we have issues with control\nBut right now we're saying\nWhich some people are calling in infect apocalypse that insects are disappearing studies done in Europe and studies done here in the U.S are finding many insect populations are decreasing of paper just came out looking at the rain forest\nSpecies they're also declining and then do species would treat them are declining whether it be amphibians birds et cetera so we're seeing things which um is changing drastically our ecosystem and we rely very heavily on all these and verb it's as I said from the beginning\nThey're the ones keeping the plight of running so whether they're pollinating our food pollinating or the food for other animals whether they're cleaning up whether they are the food for other animals to keep them alive\nAll of that as an connected and as we started pulling on each of these different strings of these in a relationship Web or pulling up the reverse of a plane\nWe're going to see problems which we may not have even thought about\nWe are talking with Dr ... he's the curator of invertebrates and the director for the center of native pollinators conservation at the St Louis do\nLet me ask you this when my daughter calls me up and says there's a spider in my room I think oftentimes our first reaction is is killing or there's another bugs or there's another insect is it OK to kill a spider\nUm for me I actually we just catch him and put them up so high and my wife used to be very afraid of spiders or she's gotten over most of her fears after something like the jumping spiders she now finds\nAn incredibly I tell them that\nIf there is a spider we find in the house for most of the species they've kind of inadvertently got in the house I wandered into that\nYeah so they actually do far better outside we usually have you know a cop for ... or something and just scoop them up and put 'em right outside okay there's really no need to deal with it\nNow for certain things yeah there you know we can be annoyed with various types of flies me you know but as I sat there are several ways of even dealing with those for example with mosquitoes\nIf you're bothered while being outside a very simple method of\nIt does if you're bothered well being outside a very simple method of keeping you from being bothered is to set up some sort of fans mosquitoes are actually very poor flyers so if you have sort of fat if you're on the porch with the ceiling fan of conception other fan\nUm there are also some very simple techniques to reduce the breeding population has some types of mosquitoes like the house mosquito which is\nRequires really no effort to no chemicals\nWhatsoever so there are ways of controlling these where it's not a problem with you and so he can start living in harmony with these other species which we all depend on and that's what we forget about\nWe're dependent upon each other within communities were depending upon our neighbors our government for also depended upon nature they're the ones supplying us with the food and resources and modify the environments maintaining environment so that we all actually have a good living absolutely\nLet me end on this down at the insect carry him what is the one animal down there that jazz is the most shivering the most ... look at that\nI think it depends upon the end of it I think spiders are probably right up there a sense of bees are\nBut I think right now with a bow at the zoo events one thing which doesn't necessarily cause shivers but it's actually one of the most popular things we have going on right now in fact Terry him when he first enter the term we have a video display and we changed that up throughout the year but right now it's on giant insects\nAnd movies so we all like a little bit of fear and we watch the movie is whether you know the giant mantis or the black scorpion or the Godzilla films with moss rough yes I'm\nOr different spiders that is at this time of year is one of our most popular attractions actually so people watch that and they remember those movies that they saw as a kid or going to see if a little bit of fear that the\nGrossly exaggerated but I think that's one where people get into that okay there's a fear but then hopefully when they go through the rest of the building\nThey become educated as to their nothing to fear there's something to appreciate there's something to respect and hopefully protect and that's also one of the major roles with his new to the conservation ... other people to get involved to\nSpeed that gives the curator of invertebrates and the director for the center of the native pollinator
