much less to\nBut now the city's homeless shelter bitter house announced it's cutting back on help for the homeless no more walk ins or get help that means that nearly two hundred people today will have to find help elsewhere\nMiddle house which has helped the folks and the one the hundred permanent beds source going from helping three hundred people a day to just do one hundred and the

they were doing those people and it was not helping them\nPassing their ever happen was new life closing down but I'm very proud of that\nOne person who disagrees is Reverend Larry Rice who ran the new life homeless shelter which he says I had a long record of helping the homeless but more than forty years he says Waterman is are wrong about the facilities about the way they treated the homeless and about the state of the problem that people\nOthers should run off to clean up in the lead and unfortunately we're not able to hold and I think you know whenever you have the lead ... should be

their comments are going to be about you know there's\nProbably pretty status quo from what you expect they'll talk about being opportunistic they'll talk about being aggressive they'll use the words that they have in the past so I Would point more for their actions and that that I think is always reveal like when you think about it in the past twelve months what has been two of their larger action one\nFiring the manager during the season for the first time since Nineteen Ninety five\nTo trying to make a play for the highest biggest payment contract in baseball and being willing to take on two hundred and fifty or more million of that deal which in call Sam says yeah the traits\nWould you if I told you three years ago for the cardinals will be willing to do that when you say those are those don't seem like cardinal moves those don't seem very characteristic and yet that's where they were one move they did make\nThe other one they just were waiting on a guy to say yes he's turned out he said no but he says yeah San says yes then the next day the cardinals aren't enough for the largest contract they've ever offered now that they're doing it's one that there willingly taken on\nSo I think their actions speak to a level of urgency that maybe they're full scale and a recognition\nThat they have to take I strive\nTo step by step by step have kept them in the game to win the game they got to take a strike the\nBiggest names out there this year Machado barber serious thought a nice guy why it's possible though maybe it's a fight for the fans started about the Internet just goes to that all day long yeah what's realistic ... put it takes for each of those guys end up here\nCalmer than zero money they are I mean a lot I mean I'm imagining locations a huge part of that because history no\nI doubt it I mean I mean you don't really see team players choosing for history's sake seemed the teams are you saying free agents talk about the future and what they mean is the immediate future they want to win now I mean if you're Bryce Harper and you're going to sign a ten year deal\nAre you really interested in winning an ear five\nAre you interested in winning here one two three four and five and then of course it's it's a media if they want to be a part of a winning team when they say that baseball such as it is such a a again now where everybody has money to spend the cardinals are in the midst of what will work out to be a one point one one point two\nBillion dollar TV deal and they're not alone that the game is flush with cash and revenue teams can make the offer\nWhere the game has changed for the cardinals is they're not the only one willing to stretch\nAnd some of the teams on the coast that used to not be factors in free agents especially in recent years because they were bumping up against attack now they're free and clear that some of these teams can spend money and they will spend money and they can offer a toast up liquor city they can offer you know I mean I don't\nThink there is an alert for the ... tribes [noise] um but that's the south tip a team if a guy goes to Los Angeles says I really embrace the history of the Dodgers there's really a great thing the size and opportunity comes with being a Hollywood\nRight Neal Spain was playing in the Bronx yeah probably alerted the instructor but there's the big market aspect to it for their clothes ... guys who have reached free agency\nThey want a choice us or they have spring training if they have a home in Arizona that's an edge the cardinals aren't going to relocate to goes there's not a beach coming up that it's you know the Mississippi River there's not Madison Avenue looking to relocate\nSo they have to sell something else\nAnd then the end if everybody can sell the same salary and the cardinals have to overcome either\nWhat kind of city they're selling for what kind of size market they're selling what future they have\nThat's where the sales pitch has to be they have to tell them that look you can be part of a winter now and here's the proof of that you can be part of a place you want to play long term you can be part of the place and you know they used to sell the family aspect guys don't have families are reaching free agency owner now so\nYou want to start a family here's a place where you can do\nYou think you'll pursues either either but what do you think they're interested in that six days I think\nThey are I mean well no I mean they'll go through the process because they fought for themselves to find out from you you know the answer is no unless you try fried it's guaranteed if you don't try that you'll never never sign a guy so um I think they will I think you know they're\nThey're trying to do that they gathered intelligence you know they had a feel for what Machado was looking for at least what Machado would have to be offered because they they go through the trade disgusting with Baltimore and what that would look like and\nTrying to sell Machado them if they got 'em in the fold sell them on staying and if they thought that was possible deal there and there's a general sense that you know he's
