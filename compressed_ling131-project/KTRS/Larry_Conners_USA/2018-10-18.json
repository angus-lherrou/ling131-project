P. C. uh the things that we talk about\nOn this show we're going to be very general they're not going to be specific ... they are not intended to be specific financial or legal advice and we encourage all your listeners to speak to their qualified professionals for specifically ...\nVery good uh you know it's it's funny you sold me his mind how time flies a Tom are you sold me a life insurance policy it does it it can be twenty twenty five years ago now\nI don't know if it was quite that long ago by Twenty years there was a while ago\nYeah and and you know I Want my money back I didn't die\nGavin pay and all that money and I never died so I haven't been able to use it to okay well\nWe'll talk about that right off the air okay let's start with the first topic I'm ... ... people my age or my mother in law just recently passed away a Howard's mother just recently passed away\nA were at that age where those that's happening and we end up collecting something sometimes it's a piece of property sometimes it's money sometimes it's who knows what it is a ... and she\nThat's fine but often we don't know what does that mean are there any tax conflicts\nThat's fine but often we don't know what does that mean are there any tax consequences do we need to report it I'm a so maybe you can walk us through just in general ideas about\nThat okay well for one of like a lot of attention has been given in the past two adept taxes this this is specifically\nWith federal state tax right now the federal estate taxes all that at ten years ago if you died with a an estate over a million dollars you would probably be subject to an estate tax today after\nA Obama increase the the ceiling quite a bit on that and then Trump did again a most married couples can pass eleven million dollars or more without any state taxes\nNow let's talk a little bit of why we're on this topic um I Do a little bit of a safe planning work some wheels things like that and most people are\nVery surprised that the things that they own typically they can pass without even having a a will everyone comes in says oh my gosh I'm so worried I say well what do you have well I you know as a house I said you can indeed the house in such a way that\nUm you know that'll pass 'em to your children or whomever you want to leave it to a upon your debt your vehicle the same thing is just a matter of having a death beneficiary death beneficiary designation\nUm life insurance the beneficiary it goes right to them all these things and bank account you can put someone's name on the bank account or a beneficiary of transfer on debt cod all of these things can be done even without using\nUm any of that the typical estate planning documents will limit trust you still want those but um you know if you just can't do that there are ways to to get part of the way they're\nRight well there's really no such thing as dying without a well because if you don't have a well the state's got ... the ... and in my in my business that's always kind of a joke frankly I have a I don't have any children uh\nI Do not actually have a well other than the one that the state provides for me and it frankly I look through it and it's pretty much the way I've really I've done a job but the thing is\nMost of my assets have beneficiary designation where it's going to my life so I uh uh what what what's left over after that is not substantial enough for me to worry that much about it now you're an attorney and you might want to um tell me why I'm wrong on ... and maybe that's a whole other conversation\nAnd and it could be but you're absolutely right I think a lot of people are surprised by that that uh you know most I Would say most Seventy five eighty like you said um maybe even Ninety percent of what you have can be passed of who you want it to pass to I'm just through a beneficiary designations round you are\nNot by the way I Do want to say that that is terrible advised not to have a welfare anybody with children yeah anybody shouldering or a second marriage that's horrible advice trimming it actually was right\nAnd then I Would absolutely agree because I tell you I'm never underestimate ah what money will do to a a family dynamic right uh well but that's another day another conversation let me ask you this Tom Martin [noise]\nGive me your eye contact information because now people are saying a wild this guy is so smart and do so much I got a call him um I got to give them where do they find you add\nUp probably the easiest way to email me at the time and Martin natural by us you can as my website Martin financial by us you could call me on the phone at three one for seven eight seven seven for for one\nOkay now now they've got that written down because we are going to continue on I have another question first year under the new tax laws\nCorrect yes in typically at the end of the year people might be saying well it's time I remember I Would add up all of the ... the solicitations for\nUm contributions and charities and we'd been kind of make some decisions because you wanted to get them in um a lot of that doesn't matter anymore there if it does for me you want to be um generous but from a tax perspective\nFor the average household ... doesn't matter anymore does it she huge number\nOf people are taking a standard deduction where they hadn't before but uh the standard deduction is larger for one and the dachshunds are more limited you cannot deduct your state and local taxes any mhm I'm so huge number going to be taking the standard deduction\nUm that means and I'm not sure how the charitable thing plays into that kind of caught me a little doll\nYeah ... but I think as I understand there's still that the charitable there but I mean when you start looking at those numbers that you know it's kind of a bar that you have to get over um you know if you're just the person that was you know given a few hundred\nGet over um you know\nIf you're just the person that was you know given a few hundred or a few thousand even a but that's not pushing you up and over the bar it's you're under the standard deduction right\nIt most people ... their taxes are going to be much more simplified 'em and they are probably going to pay less most people um we didn't get down to the point that the\nPresident promised us where we can do it on a postcard as far as if you're just not the thing is if you're a business owner you have no idea how advantageous tax bill that\nWe'll see I Am a small business owner is the

police the pro FBI pro just law enforcement and now I'm ... anybody\nIs a threat to the president is now a liar cheat or in the um the FBI the head of the FBI we've got to get rid of you when did that happen\nWell it happened when president decided that he didn't want to be investigated about I mean something\nAh and again you know talking to the president's use language about the FBI that again you and I are old enough to remember what was the kind of stuff at the most radical anti\nLaw enforcement left layers would use about deep state and the wall let's FBI agents and the the the scoops up the CIA and the intelligence community the rogue intelligence community\nThis is all the rhetoric of the far left not of American conservatives and I think it really has been a disservice to people who you know have paid a price to be members of the law enforcement and the intelligence community but not is not an easy job\nAnd and you really do kind of pay a price in your life to be a part of that community and the attacks by the press or just shocking to me I mean I really just astounding\nYeah I I don't think that I've ever run into um people that I Would describe the way the president described some within the FBI were of some of those agencies and I'm a lawyer and and I do see them I don't get it now\nI Want to make sure that the people that are maybe more in favor of the president does say well what are you going to do go over to the Democrat you don't um you don't pull any punches with the Democrats either you say I'm not ready to uh to board that train\n[noise] no and in fact they um when I wrote in that piece in the Atlantic about the ... the Democrats during the Capitol hearing I Believe the word used was extra ...\nYes and I look it up\nA you know that that the Democratic party is a I think the Democratic party is headed for its own crack up shortly in a way Donald Trump save the Democrats because I think they had they elected Hillary Clinton their sector left group and they're far left group we're going to have a major\nFalling out and that got\nPaper it over for the time being but they're still there I mean there are stored totalitarian streak on the American left that makes me deeply uncomfortable makes me makes impossible for me to be a Democrat um I could have got a Democrat forty years ago when the Democrats where I come from working class family I should say that\nBy the way down in much Democrat\nYes and I could have my parents were Democrats until the late sixties like a lot of people who felt the party left them after the late Nineteen sixty move too far to the left so the idea that I Would become a Democrat is just laughable I mean it's first of all I they don't represent what I Believe and and they certainly would never have\nMe given many of them use ... still [laughter]\nSo ah you know that's just not going to happen I'm just part of that kind of center right a part of the independent\nVoters in America now and that ... you know I wouldn't dare Democrats I Will happily vote for um the Republicans I Would still vote for although not in this election I think the Republicans really need to lose this next election badly\nOr to kind of maybe shake them out of whatever they've fallen into but um I plan to engage in the great American tradition of ticket splitting for the rest of my life\nYou know Tom

Shakespeare production and the premier is Mick back\nAnd spin like shadows and\nThere's this is not your I'm the seventh grade they actually was ninth grade that's when most people out of that yeah it is not your ninth grade Macbeth visit\nIt certainly is not it's not even your Shakespeare and the park and they think\nIt is that even close let's talk about immersive theater you've been on before the last one was hamlet is that right yet that that ... the last time I was I right that's right and we talked about immersive theater but tell us once again\nBut right now and we're talking about a nurse or theater but tell us once again what is a immersive theater\nSo immersed in theater is something that I'm a group of friends and colleagues and I sort of dreamed up in um I Would guess somewhere between two thousand five two thousand seven\nWe were trying to come up with ways you know a lot of us were working on Broadway off Broadway and we've been kind of look out into the crowd when the show's over and we would notice that there was no in our age in the audience and it was so we kind of\nLike when I give a sermon a church and I looked up there and everyone who's my age but no longer than [laughter]\nSadly that and you know we started getting worried for the fate of theater and we thought you know how can we make our stories more enticing more exciting more emergent\nAnd personal for people who are maybe our age and what we've\nMade an idea so they can get her us either you're young you're both young but give the the listeners an idea of when you say our age because you know I'm like you to know and are\nMuch worse than you in and out and people I mean people in their twenties people in their thirties or forties or even talking about people up to their sixties but it's a different type of audience member it's not the type of audience who\nNecessarily has a subscriber to get to somewhere like ... or so we'll see both on last night yeah my buddy Steve yeah um yeah it gets about\nRe invigorating or the youth to have a reason to go to the theater and to reach out entice them and engage them in a way that they can grow up with that in their culture here in the United states certainly in London or some other places maybe that's more woven into the culture but\nIt's exciting them and getting them out and having them yeah absolutely\nYeah and that and there's it's just a different different method to do that I'm with an immersive theater you kind of blur or it in our case remove the fourth wall altogether so you don't go and you said in the theater get a ... sort of wait for the show to happen\nEverything happens once you walk in the door and it's an experience it's not like you're watching the play it you become a part of this world and you become invested into characters to inhabit that world in in the world itself and you see so many parallels to our own lives\nDepending on the story that we're telling and in this instance were telling the story of Macbeth or telling it in a very fresh\nIt I suppose you you don't want people join in you know ... bum Russian you up ... actors right right yeah and there's less they're invited to write a certain amount of his first patient and then there's disruption yeah Jay\nDon't [laughter] except\nIn certain moments where we get that you can send to Jay then you may you may tells you\nTo us no means no correct um what about somebody who is somewhat adventurous but doesn't really you know\nDoesn't want to be pulled up onto the stage and made part of the production can they still enjoy it can make participate be immersed in it without having to you know I I just want to participate I Want to experience I don't want to be an actor\nCompletely there's a few tracks and this where uh you'll get sort of ... singled out or one on one attention but we're reading that from the moment you come through the door and we're talking to each other and we have hand signals of this was the person tonight\nOr ... or re Malone early just want to watch that route want to be drug allergy to me it's like I get it I Want to say I really I\nYou know ... there are others who just are me\nMe me me me exactly and they're always there every every show because how they can look at you can look at your body language I tell if you wanted if you want to be of a deeper part of this story or not\nWe even have a whole safe word in a safe gesture if it just in case right we get it wrong almost never do word banana [laughter] well maybe it is that I don't know [laughter] you're going to say this on the road or at least as I've read here that's the plan that the planets\nIt's to try out here in St Louis and we're bringing in some people to come and see it and talking to other theaters and other cities I'm\nActually I'm tapping into some of my networks because they perform in London and Hong Kong as well\nAnd it's it's a much different ball game there and they're still invested in the culture and the arts in those places that the tickets they go for forty five dollars here and in London they would go for about sixteen hundred dollar oh my gosh I Know it's crazy\nYeah ... how did you where did you come up with this idea I mean it's just really unique or is this something that you stole and you're taking credit\nWish I wish I could take credit for it now and some just pairs of mine at certain are pioneers in it you we have punch drunk that came out of London\nAnd my personal favorite is Richard Crawford in secret theater and he he works out of both New York in London now Hong Kong and now Singapore and to me is actually I think the leader\nIn the world right now he is coming up with\nAnd to me is actually I think the leader in the world right now he's coming up with the most exciting ideas most original ones and working with him as a dream because he always know that the project is going to be something that people are going to go absolutely crazy over\nYeah that's Kelly
