I never had\nIt was just another tool in their arsenal of it and this is akin to what we've already seen and there were sort of mini temp is tea pots and a little controversies that stirred up along the way\nAs we started to see the rollout of first red light cameras and then just police cameras and there's several of those around the city that have those little red and blue flashing lights on top of them\nAnd sell that St Louis police foundation is a local non profit that pays for Clinton in ... city and county police that they've donated for drones to the department and they have nine officers to I guess you have to license to fly down\nAnd they're fair sized drones too I mean these are not the little you know out of the box radio shack radio shack doesn't exist anymore but you know what I mean those little teeny things these are big massive drones\nAnd they fly silently are almost silently you would never ever hear him if they were over your head unless you happen to look up and see one there but there will be looking at us and eat this seems like the kind of thing that if it if this was the first step\nEfficient happened Twenty years ago and all of a sudden drone technology was ... and they started putting these things up I think people would have gone uh they they would have had a problem with this\nWell apparently they already have them in ... creed color you recount and in Madison County sheriff's department has them yeah but the article says back in third team win then police chief Sam Dotson flooded the idea of using drones to monitor cardinals games and the idea was met with backlash ... civil liberties union\nAnd here we are five years later and and there's not really any backlash all and in fact there's a couple of places as you said where there are already in use a how high road they fly ... will they can they can go up to four hundred feet are only four hundred feet right so they I mean that that's not bad\nTo have to be within a line that disability and the pilot\nRight you will you also don't want to get in the way of traffic air traffic helicopters and things like that uh so the FAA is going to have a concern about this but that's why they're keeping them under that four hundred foot a level but that's plenty high enough and you have to figure if they get much higher than that they're not going to be able to see anything anyway\nAnd they will assist policing car chases for one tank car chases and foot chases areas in ... right\nAnd so you know I Know the argument is that you could compare this to a police helicopter which they do the same thing with those now using forward looking in for red and all kinds of technology camera technology\nTo chase somebody but the wonder is okay how much looking into us are they going to be doing when we're just out there minding our own business\nAnd that's that's where I think people get tripped up a little bit with things like this or at least you know start to have some questions about how these things are going to be used or they only going to be deployed but there's already a\n... that's what their their rules say they're only six circumstances under which the drones can be years documenting crime scenes\nThey're only six circumstances under which the drones can be used documenting crime scenes planning tactical responses during emergencies assisting with search and rescue assessing the scope of a scene providing aerial perspective during special circumstances which would include crowd control shirt and traffic management\nTraffic I mean that would really be helpful I guess\nYeah I mean we've we've already got traffic cameras up on all the major roadways but uh you know having that extra we hear from turmoil and all the time that he gets frustrated because ... voted off the charts of cameras and if it's part of the wrong way there's not one you write about it\nAnd I know from decades and sitting behind a news desk when we were trying to broadcast certain traffic accidents a drum we've come in and be very handy right hand when you're in your car sitting\nThere and you you can't get the information I think it'd be very handy for police to get the word out to a media\nBut the slippery slope argument with is is okay so we sign on for this and there's only six circumstances under which they can be used how long will it be until something happens where the police and say well if we had the drone available Jewish we could use it here too\nAnd as you are saying their cameras everywhere right and and there's police cameras everywhere there's people looking at all the time citizen journalists cameras everywhere right just issue every citizen\nTheir own personal police drone had followed who as you go about your day every day and as long as you don't break the law you have nothing to worry about we can ... can ... [laughter] but the thing is there was a Sunday Morning when\nWe were all trying to get into the heights in veteran hype and somebody shot up ... said the doors were shot and dad miner who runs forty south news and he's great at it takes a picture so there's a picture on the line of all of us waiting to get into the heights\nAnd you know we look hideous [laughter] there's relatively speaking you're in a dressing room I have nobody has cameras in there [laughter] try and well they do when you try and close in a department store lady day you're on camera\nHere's where the innovator in me starts to come out because what I'm thinking is there was a there was a movie many many years ago one of the Cheech and Chong movies I think it was nice dreams and there was a scene at the end of that where they were using a police helicopter\nTo try to find the ... of these guys were growing up it was it's a Cheech and Chong movie and they had this grow house\nAnd it was concealed by a giant tarp that from above looked like a swimming pool so here's what I'm thinking oh if if it starts to become a problem all we have to do is have umbrellas that from above looked like the sidewalk\nThing you can walk anywhere they'll never see you never know where you are you going to have these even wear like a Paris all you know connected to your shoulders and just to have a little side\nOne of your head as yours solution show John Gray so everything\nIs going to be okay and the only way they'd be able to see is if the fluids six foot level and then you know they were there and said oh that's what I Am an innovator I'm an idea\nMan there you go all you implement turns out they are led ... implement that idea\nThat's right and if you do it without asking me I Will sue ya now I Want I'm just kidding go ahead and do it but\nEither way I buy one if somebody made one of those I'd buy one just wear around and have people wonder about me which they already the umbrella thing yes yeah absolutely ... gives you an idea idled ... you know you can't you know it's legal in most places to go out in public wearing a mask\nI did not you can't you in debt for Halloween\nNo no just in general I I usually they'll make concessions for Halloween but if you walk outside wearing a mask just on an average Thursday you can get busted for that\nWhat about the kind of mask that women put on his latest high on mentors are allowed to go out and buy liquid those why would you want to [laughter] that's I think ... thank you wouldn't want to but would you be arrested what's\nWhat now what Jeffrey as a savior wanted three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven or you can text and they'd for one to six hello Geoffrey\nTied yeah\nJust for the year before there were no because there were three or\nFour or by the audience for someone else I don't know but I remember it was unusual I took one\nYou know that's that's an excellent point because with police officers you usually if they come in to your house or whatever if they think there's something going on the first thing they have to do is identify themselves as ... but we can't tell\nMultiple law enforcement sources tell in ABC News the suspect was trapped using a cell phone authorities have recovered that cell phone or laptop computer and other electronic devices from this suspect ABC the pilgrims outside a postal facility in Ocala\nSources are telling us that they were looking for DNA evidence\nThat we give them some insight into\nThis person was where they were sending these packages out of leading to that a person being in ...\nThe latest is suspicious packages recovered were sent to senator Cory Booker in Florida and former director\nThis suspicious packages recovered were separate senator Cory Booker in Florida and former director of national intelligence James Clapper shelf ... and ... and and Jennifer\nBelow\nOr make scientific getting the arrest John Grayson Jennifer gloomy here with you and we're talking this segment about an event that's coming up this evening or here in town that surrounds an organization called boy so girls and\nA a movie that has not been made from a book by our guest in Studio city ... called a chance in the world and we also have with us Ryan ... president of the St Louis affiliate of boys or girls how gentlemen welcome\nThank you so much for joining thanks for having us try and tell us briefly about boys have girls helped\nSo boys or girls hope is a nonprofit that it's actually an international organization we have a fourteen affiliates in the United states and then uh and Mexico and Guatemala\nI'm ... I'm with the St Louis affiliate so we're in orientation is just taking a youth in need they're really academic Lee motivated and capable and uh we have residential facilities they live with us we provide access to college in education for them\nA these are just amazing kids that have so much potential and have overcome so much already um we're just making it possible or helping make it possible for them to get to and through college\nKnocking down walls shake jak ... it's great work and it's worth it needs to be done because as we mentioned Steve ... and also with us the author of a chance in the world and Steve talk a little bit about your story and what what brings you here to talk to these kids today [noise]\nWell my story's implied in the title a chance in the world that was the diary entry or a babysitter a marijuana half years old I was in the care of my mother who is in the middle of a losing battle with alcoholism and he's in east wrote in his diary that this little boy doesn't have a chance in the world\nAnd I went off into the foster care system multiple placements all of them incredibly turbulent very difficult to navigate it um [noise] a drawl a bit to get to college and uh when I graduated from college I dusted off my childhood dream of becoming the detective and went looking for my biological family and found them [noise]\nUm and so my career you know there's always been folding kind of mission centered work current so helping people get into college helping people find the next job a ball brains are focused on healthcare now global force bringing positively to the world but it came from those early years of being\nA not to be employed about about being discarded by society\nThat Steve how did you get to college if you grew up in foster care and where did you grow up\nSo I grew up in a community called New Bedford south of the city you you pronounce that new ... if you come from a history of ... first stop on the underground railroad center of wailing stuck in the study was that he likes the world\nOr in in my freshman year in high school I'm In the middle of this you know just trying to fend off this terrible foster family bought a good foster families out there but unfortunately I did not encounter them [noise]\nUm and um I heard about this program called up with ... which was about college prep for preparatory um environment so I learned what classes or take how to apply for scholarships I wound up living for my last year of high school or what the teacher in that program wow\nYeah and so ah and today might get caught him brand for jobs\nAs gravity kids do you have three teenagers three teenagers yeah obviously they've had a a path that was slightly less ... than yours or do they get it do they appreciate what they have versus what do you grow up in 'cause that's a tough thing to get through to catch\nIt is it is John and and the hard truth of it is that no they don't get it and and I don't want him to an end offensive I don't want you to experience it but like many uh many parents of of this generation of the other hand I Want you to have the hunger though yeah ... because there was the hunger to\nAh to make sure that the cycle doesn't get repeated that drove me and so you got to have some of that and the power to household so we talk to you about things like work ethic and uh and the importance of pursuing your dreams but also being of service to\nSo you voted best selling book when you became a movie which will be released on December fast is getting mean um how much can tell us about the making of the movie do a lot of authors just signed it over and have nothing to do with\nIt yeah I refuse to do that to be on a good ah because it became very clear to be sitting in a meetings in Hollywood that there was the way that\nI wanted to do it and then there was the way they wanted to do it and those who rose did not match up close and personal but it was clear to me to a different vision the my vision was of the power that we all have to bend the arc of our lives especially children\nThere'd be because as Ryan rightly points out ah for the young people in boys or girls up late reflect all these\nQualities of coverage and resilience and healing\nUm and so I Want to tell the story that was not of the tragedy but more of a triumph in this partnership that emerges between me and this high school teacher so together we become you know quite a force a and he's played by Tom size more in in in the movie\nHere pay here uh this amazing child actor a to real ransom junior um who you know I Would be on the set\nAnd I would kind of watch them in between that and of course you know we developed a a bond in a relationship because he's playing music he had a lot of questions for me um but he I saw one time during uh during a break and it's just what you're doing goes I'm I'm working on my book like Thirteen Years old\n[laughter] this this this kid from a different planet [laughter] you know what I Want to step away from the story for just a minute in and go back to ride McClure from St Louis boys or girls hope of the events going on tonight where Steve we'll be speaking talk about what's going on\nSo the event tonight is um the evening of how to this is our ... annual Gallup fundraiser on it it's a huge knife or as a big milestone throughout the year [noise]\nUm and which is really excited about it we're actually sold out down tonight is the first time a long time there have been sold out and they're still showed up at\nThe important not love Ian ... above you you and Jennifer so I wanted to be here and you know we're just excited to have Steve there and and be part of this because Steve Scott I'm\nOf a great connection with our kids and his story mirrors a lot of the some of the things that our kids have experienced and and then through on the average stories unique obviously\nBut he's also got a personal connection to voice girl so they're his role or on the board of our international organization I'm so there's just a lot of reasons that they were really thrilled and on her dad Steve with us tonight and and uh being part of this evening\nYou know what I what I'm Wondering the most is when you when you look back on an outlook bags even your childhood in your five years old six years old seven years old and you're in these bad situations time and time again\nWhat was the thing that motivated you what kept you go and was just wanting a better life was wanting to get out was that faith and what was there that made you get through\nIt was all those things ... and one of those things came to me because I Love to read that was my passion um\nI wasn't allowed to do a lot of other things are other kids did I didn't live in a world of little league games and play dates and there wasn't a robot lived and libraries are free exactly right and I snuck off to them every chair so I got a good man it was hard to pull me out of the library\nAnd I snuck off to them every chair so I got a good man it was hard to pull me out of the library but that was so important to\nMe because it gave me a vision and value so I saw intact families I saw nurturing adults [noise]\nUh I didn't eat around me but I read about it and that I developed this ridiculous idea that I could that I could have at one day but the truth of it is that uh the other thing I probably had as I I came into the world with a bit of defiance so I think when the good lows in and out the fires I snuck back in line and I got to\nTouch 'em a don't tell me what I Can't do exactly right or or tell me so like improved you otherwise\nUm [noise] uh but uh you know that I think would have us gravitate more towards the ego right and and and the um with the individual exceptionalism but what really happened were these interactions that I began having with these just kind of ordinary people neighbor who brought me a box of books a mailman walking through the neighborhood\nWho would always tell me a to keep reading about the high school teacher who took me and the director of an upper bomb program up about a lot like boys or girls hope\nSo [noise] uh even though I don't have that one adult I have these interactions that unbeknownst to these people are literally changing in transforming ... my life in the sense that they are affirming the goodness that I read about\nIt so I I see that in these in these moments and now\nYou know you you do your point you get a little bit older and the debt goodness is something that we are such in desperate need of today that's for sure and so I was very purposeful about writing a binding the book in that way in a while I was so striking about the film being adapted that way because I wanted to demonstrate\nAnd show by example the power that we have in our so called ordinary ... uh to impact the life of a young person who then subsequently will also go on as I'd like to think I've done raise
