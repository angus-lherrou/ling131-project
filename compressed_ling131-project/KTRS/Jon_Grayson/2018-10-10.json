when I went to a one of the gyms there to work out there was a show girl next to me with a roller blades on on a treadmill\nAnd I thought that was pretty fascinating it's usually would could be counterproductive you just stand there and hold on to the bars well we'll do all the words\nAnd then she didn't hold on to the bars and then because people stay up all night and they said they pump oxygen into the casinos I don't know do they do that nobody ever gets tired I've no idea that people would come out of the gym\nAnd then get a ... okay\nSo get up in the morning to the gym come out of

out of the toy industry now\nBecause you know the toys are us maybe coming back yeah there is a bid to bring them back there is another huge name and toys that set to come back and they've already signed a lease back in times square\nFAO Schwarz [noise] wow been going since twenty Fifteen and so it looks like things may be looking up in the toy industry we'll talk more about that just ahead stay with us on the big five fifty Katie Irish\nI I you know it would be tough for the ball to get through it mhm is he with football the ball's not supposed to touch the ground much um but yeah it'd be fun to watch their religion and they'd have to do like you know they they have drawn Carney was telling me about this for golfers they're or golf balls that are painted that bright orange\nThing for them but also in forest park and then\nYou know this honey it uh I I Want to see golfers on there and a blizzard going at it you know and I say that it has probably happened it down a lot of ...\nThere's other in a blizzard going at it you know and I say that it's probably happened\nIs there a lot of golfers in forest park in the winter\nAnd those guys are hardcore so I'm a yeah dude they would have to do something similar with a soccer ball making bright yellow or orange or something like that go out there you know add a little panache to the game on us or some other things going on in the world do and as we mentioned to you and this is will slide into this and just a couple of minutes vis a CNN town hall\nThat they're planning now and I mean granted it to Texas Senate race in the politics of it really matter much\nBut I I think in terms of news coverage it does matter a where CNN had this town hall plan for the free closest Senate races in the country and one of them is this Texas race between but Oregon Ted Cruz Ted Cruz declined to show up so as it\nStands right now if they go through with it it's going to be a one hour campaign commercial effectively for Beto O'Rourke he gets to stand out there and look great in near those but there were work and I'm really cool and you should vote for me\nAnd talk to people about the issues without having to worry about somebody on the other side taking him to task representing another side show should CNN pull the plug or do they go ahead and say look we offer them a microphone he declined we still have an audience to serve we're still going to cover this race like we were going to\nAnd I'm sure they would have a moderator who would debate him yeah I I Know you're not the same obviously but again why would Ted Cruz decline it\nRight and I think it's really because he didn't want to stand on the stage on TV next to somebody like that or who would make him you would make him look pay worrying comparison a simply on physical basis on a way that he presents himself Ted Cruz is not\nSomebody who is your generally considered to be a somebody who can hold an audience with his hand you know he's not the most likeable guy in the world\nAnd to all accounts although I've not seen him much better or work kind of is\nSo to put yourself in a position where you let television make the decision for you is tricky for those guys will take a quick phone call on this but again you know forgetting ... who they are and what they represent do you put on a town hall where only one of the candidates decides to show up\nOr do you pull the plug out of ten forty two and we'll bring John into the next say John you're on the big five fifty Katie Irish [noise]\nMardi Gras John how are you guys today good good\nWhile you're discussing this man first of all\nWe all do CNN is democratic and of course it was done on Fox we've pro Trump everything like that when I look at the ratings are some of these people for some of these newscast or shows [noise] probably about ten people\nWatch it on CNN [noise] [laughter] right so what difference does it really make it you know cruise probably thinks it's gonna be biased\nSo he feels he doesn't have anything to gain right now I go now you know if you're the news director at CNN do you go ahead and put Little Rock on for an hour the color\nOf course you do because you're you're playing to his his group I mean the the the left I guess you would say I'm completely elemental and all of these things but this is one that I think that will push comes to shove you just let it happen\nOkay to take a left and right out of it for a second what I mean is it forget that it's these two candidates if you say we're going to do a town hall with two candidates for a Senate race in one of them says I'm not going to show up regardless of who it is should you go through with it anyway having made the offer or do you say if we can put on both were not going to put on anything\nWell I guess if you know you you you've already probably still sponsorship you just go ahead with it OK okay fair enough I think\nYeah I think so too thanks for calling excel ... and everybody knows Ted Cruz didn't want to do it right and he chose not to be represented so\nSo as long as they may be offered go ahead and\nGo flashing people not being able to hear from you know the other guy\nYeah there is more to that will do talk about uh just ahead if you want to jump in three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven or you can text entity for one to six will do some we're talking with you and we'll get to the tax on a bunch of text coming in on this as well uh including most people to get on your side saying yeah go ahead and put it on more to come on the big
