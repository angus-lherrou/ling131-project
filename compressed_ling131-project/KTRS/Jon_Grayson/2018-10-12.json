is from the seem seem that brought us extreme ownership and now the brand new one is called dichotomy of leadership balancing the challenges of extreme ownership to lead and win junk willingly Babin thank you both for being here\nThanks Ramadan on John like you to hear from you and and I want to talk first of all a little bit for folks who are not familiar with the first book about extreme ownership talk about what that is and how it differs from like micro management\nWorld extreme ownership is definitely an attitude\nAnd a mindset where you're not going to blame anyone else you're not gonna blame anything else you're going to take ownership winners problems and you're going to get those problem solved and there is definitely this we just right and then the next book that dichotomy of leadership because you're right there is if someone's trying to take ownership of everything and they have that attitude well\nI mean some people if they if they get off base a little bit about how they're supposed to do this they start micromanaging and they start trying to tell everyone exactly what they want to do and in your mind I think they're doing a good job because they're taking ownership but they're really doing is they're inhibiting their team from making decisions and growing and from\nMoving quickly out there in the field so what you want to do is you want to have a balance and that's what the book dichotomy of leadership was about having that balance it's about knowing that you don't want to micromanage\nBut at the same time you don't want to be way far any other direction where people on the ground don't have good guidance and they're not sure what direction they should be adding where you want to be and you want to be balanced and that's one of the examples of the many different dichotomy of leadership\nAnd you both served as US Navy seal officers to talk about taking that the experience and the discipline that comes from being a Navy SEAL and working that into a work environment we're maybe not everybody has had that same kind of military background\nThat's uh that's something that people get wrong I think people think that well how are you going to translate your combat experience to the business world too personal lives and really we can we talk about combat leadership leadership is really just\nGetting a diverse group of people to work together to accomplish the mission and that that applies to anything in life any team any organization that that tried to get a group of people to to accomplish the mission and and just like uh in the business world uh or or lie for sports team or whatever it may be military units\nAnd got different people that have come from different backgrounds different attitudes and different egos and that's always the biggest challenge and and certainly while it's life or death\nOn the line a in combat and it may not necessarily be be that way even if it even if it is it lives on the line I Know uh in the business world there's livelihoods I'm a lot there's a lot of pressure at stake if people's jobs at stake people's careers at stake and so uh so those those things directly translate\nOne of the things that I thought it was fascinating about this is that there's a story that comes up near the end of the book where an officer is one of these my way or the highway kinds of guys and you describe that as the weakest form of leadership it's interesting to hear that from again from a military standpoint that that we just say I'm the guy with the bird on my shoulder I make the decisions why that weakness\nThat's absolutely weakness and again that's another misconception that people have of the military that that guy up in the senior rank and just going to bark orders down the chain of command and everyone's going to agree with them and move on\nWell we all know that ten or twelve brains is smarter than one and so if you're a leader you shouldn't be taking import from your team finding out the best plan finding out the best way to get things done and utilizing a ... a collaborative effort to figure out how you're gonna make something happen\nOnly about on certain three year

before we get to this week's movie or you horrified at my anti stars more biased [noise]\nNo no no it's not a biased you had no logical known people shouldn't go see films that they don't want to go see now is okay I mean I I wouldn't think the Jennifer ... would enjoy venom so I wouldn't tell her to go see it everybody else but when she but she didn't see stars stars born and enjoy it a indoor to even though she fell asleep so I didn't think that\nI think everybody should go see what they think will resonate with them every once in a while you get to be surprised I mean I certainly watch a lot of films I Would never see if I didn't have this job yeah and I've been surprised by many of them there was a film\nA devastating film about the loss of a child called a rabbit hole with Nicole Kidman they came out a couple of years ago I Would have never watched it had I not had to watch your screener I didn't know what it was about floored me thought it was incredible and I'm really happy that I watch every every once in a while you should\nThink outside the box but if you don't want to see stars born almost see in your life will be fine okay go oh yeah that's true because ... ... to go see it\nOh if she does all go by and she hasn't expressed any interest I wouldn't expect that she would I don't think it's our kind of movie but\nI'm just hoping that McGraw plays the shallow every single day on your show because he's been playing that song a lot\nThat was a song from it you know it's ... yeah and uh you know I I think the first time we talked about it I should I hate the roads because for some reason I conflated those two movies the rows and it stars boil it and made it into my review yet they have a charming in but I realized my mistake\nSorry about that but I I mean every they're both horrible songs for show her that said this week\nWell we have a movie this week called first man I also wonder if we're not because of his new football my shows on a special time it's on Sunday nights at eight o'clock or something at eight o'clock my special guest will be dean Cain who has a controversial new movie out he's also Superman and a buffalo bill\nHe was the Buffalo Bills for a very brief period of\nTime for it yeah and did not ever actually play in the NFL\nNo he suffered a practice injury a while they were getting ready while they were in training camp and was not able to return\nSo I'm going to talk about that and about his career and I would have been different had gone into football and ... you know what are you still go into acting and of course we'll talk about his new movies yes he's on the show and of course to be talking about first man this is a film that I Believe Jennifer bloom is going to see today wow look at you and I and why the why the rush opening day\nI've seen one movie since I've started listening to max and working with and then I think I had in the past ten\nYears a little credit for ...\nI feel I think that's wonderful I think that's absolutely fantastic\nI've read more books this year is one of those guys are All right so let's talk about first man I mean there have been so many films about a landing on the moon about the missions to the moon\nI and I think we've all seen most of them I Do feel like required viewing I think for a lot of American the writers of yeah you've got the right stuff you've got the other missions to space like Apollo Thirteen or you've got hidden figures which came out a couple of years ago which was really the untold story of the black female mathematician\nThat helped us to do this something that none of us learned in school which made me very angry at you you know there's forty fifty years later we finally get a movie about those young women\nBut all of these movies you could watch it and figures and the right stuff and first man they're all about the same\nCollection of people you got your Gus Grissom you've got your Buzz Aldrin you got your Neil Armstrong Abu ... but the good thing about first man because I think some people are saying why are we seeing this film again we've seen this story a lot\nI mean we we were just talking about star is born being remade four times well how many missions to the moon [laughter] juicy but what's nice about first men and really the reason why I'm recommending and the reason why I enjoyed it is because this is telling a very different story\nA purposely this is about Neil Armstrong full stop that said one man it's not about the space program a at large it's not about America it's not about patriotism it's about one man it was based on a book called the life of Neil Armstrong by James are Hanson\nAnd because of this the movie takes a very narrow focus is only concerned about what this one human being was thinking and feeling when you signed up for these missions\nOr how it affected his family his wife or his kids um and of course a is also sort of in first and hints at his thoughts while he actually was the first man to walk on the moon spoiler alert she did\nA places for it I don't want you don't want to ruin old man who in the end of the moves that this film is directed by Damien ... would that might not be a name that you recognize however\nHe's an Academy Award winning director is one of the youngest or to win best director he directed a movie called whiplash with miles Taylor and um\nAnd ah oh my lord what is the other people will know he won best supporting actor or the guy from the farmers insurance uh commercials I can think of his name right now is an edit this back in when I when I Do\nKnow anyway okay so you're not if you're not escaped me but anyway he followed that up with a movie called ... which I Know I'm a girl mill haven loved and I also love is my favorite film of that year and that won best actress for\nA Emma Stone so ... so his his crew is cast usually wins wars he's a very talented young man in first third a feature or he chose this movie this re teams him with Ryan Gosling who is not in his charming Lala land mode or this is more of his um a silent\nDr mode if you watch this film called drive from a couple of years ago which was a phenomenal film very violent a disturbing moody film but gossiping barely spoke a word the entire time he's able\nHe's one of these actors she was able to convey a lot through facial expressions and body language he also did that in Blade Runner ... two thousand forty nine so she has Neil Armstrong is a very inward looking person there's lots of\nTalking heads around him you know when Cal Chandler shows up as the leader of the team and start barking orders or Jason Clarke who desperately wants to go to the moon starts barking suffered him or bus Holdren is just basically a being a bullet to everybody around him the Iraq\nBut Neal just kind of nuts and just kind of looks at the people he doesn't really\nGive a lot out he's very very internal his wife is played by Claire ... uh well I'm not familiar with because I don't watch the crowd and I know that she's huge on that show she's going to be Elizabeth sound or in the next dot in the next to a girl and the spider's Web movie um but I'm but I'm not really\nFamiliar with her and said this was the first time I I I've seen her in something and she was very very good Janet is very different than Neal she's outgoing shoes gregarious she's very um you know she does with her family she wants to make sure the neighbors like them and everything and she gets a little frustrated that Neal has this compulsion that seems to put himself in harm's way\nWhen the movie opens up and I don't consider this a spoiler because ... is historical figure and be this is the beginning of the movie they have a young daughter I'm a coup passes away\nAnd this of course affects the family because it would anybody who's lost a child that stays with you the rest of your life sure\nAnd um this is something that perhaps Neal never fully came to terms with ah at one point when you signing up for the mission for the Apollo mission or they ask him in this room hey is the death of your your young daughter going to have any effect on your psychologically where and and as you said\nYou're young daughter going to have any effect on your psychologically where and and as you said I don't see how it couldn't write\nAnd I mean that that that response was sort of had a murmur go through the crowd here because it wasn't what you were expecting you're starting to really know what I Know he's saying no ... it will it absolutely will answer that those are the themes and the issues that first man is concerned about and\nImages elegant if you look at a as the battle of wills in whiplash or the or the sort of um uh the the the ... of lowland with first man he really just wants to\nA needle down into the idea that a human being actually left the planet and walk on another celestial a plane\nThat is insane and Jennifer I were talking about this off the air but how it seems that every generation needs to be reminded that that we that we did this now I talked about how we've all seen these movies we all learned about this in school uh you know the the images of the moon landing Raleigh ingrained in our heads I was born a decade after we landed on the moon but I still I'm very aware that we did this\nBut first men do something remarkable it puts you in those capsules with Neal and with ah Michael collins with Buzz Aldrin\nAnd through an extreme disorienting shaky camera\nI'm Talking like Jason Bourne chicken came I I'm Talking about like when you go to
