R. S. star Kate T. R. S. from your cell phones or one triple eight five fifty K. T. R. S. [noise]\nYou know we're at ... I did receive a couple of calls this week while you were involved in a couple of our Medicare owned meetings are constantly ecology is if people do call me every once in a while okay they call me different things so I Can't talk about on the radio but [laughter]\nUm they did call me on and you know it's interesting because they're asking me really about ... get about fixed income about bonds got it and what most folks do realize when you think about fixed income a lot of people think about certificates deposit and they don't trade you know you buy a CD has a certain maturity period\nX. rated interests weeks rate of interest the deal that period you can renew or the bank and give your money you pay tax on the interest\nBonds work a little differently especially individual bonds you know when you're purchasing individual security as compared to being in a bond fund\nA what a curse is is that you know you're paying a price either you're buying it at a premium\nBeing a little more or to discount based on that interest rate relationship to current interest rates with bond funds you're buying basically a package of bonds\nAnd some of the questions that I received this week from a client as we were doing a review was you know Jeff I'm looking at my account and I know the streets are rising because if it's moving up interest rates but my bond funds are going down\nFor having negative returns for this year was that really happening and I think that what most folks don't realize that I Know you and I do as an investment advisors is that\nAll bonds trade in the market at the same time just like stock straight in the market at the same time right\nI think if they put some numbers today it can be a little bit more understandable so for example if I own a bond that it's a firm ... somebody like\nThat ... they're they're providing the last ... hypothetical bond as they are providing the ... percent interest right\nNow as interest rates rise and all they sat in on the market there is a bond that it had to three percent rate of return my bonded obviously worse last because I'm only getting two percent right whereas that new bonds are worth more\nRight into the market value that bond we go down so if you wanted to sell it you would be selling it at a discount\nSite if you kept it maturity he would be getting the rate of interest right you can get that lower two percent rate of interest and that's\nSomething that you certainly can do in his decision that you have to make 'em especially when you're purchasing individual boss most folks and they they typically are involved in bone funds where\nManagers are making those decisions\nFrighten as they begin to trade these bonds summer ... and they're buying new ones the problems that they're seeing is that again a lot of times the portfolio value of those bonds as insurance rise bond prices are inverse too that we're seeing those going down so even though they're getting better interest yields\nIt's not enough to overcome the guy on the face of math\nAnd so this week when we saw interest rates by could three point to three percent which it was a spike but not really ... ... ... what we know they're going there anyways because that's already high rates\nWhat we're looking at is is that um bond prices went down significantly so what we saw is when the market was declining both sides were and that's really kind of unusual sight so again a when we're looking at safety holding an individual bond to his maturity can provide principal ... reasonable\nFor potential sudden income\nAssuming it does all the risk is low I mean you're buying a bond of a you know a highly rated to let's say a high grade corporate or a government paper assumption correctly so you know you can hold that's immaturity and you get your money back but again what happens is you may be in a situation like we are today were rising interest rates really cuts into the value of those bonds because\nWhat you like in your ... hypothetical example I'm only getting too but\nIt's like when I was getting three ... three center so I'm Out the answer some questions maybe gets a little bit of clarity those folks that are looking at the market's going what is going on right now it's like we have a diversified portfolio to help us create protection but there are some times where the markets can move 'em\nSome canned them in the end them in at the same time you know hopefully they moved to the good\nRight it was particularly that was not address\nRates go down bond values could go up and do some work is going up the same time that's all real positive but when it goes the other way it hurts because it feels like it's a double negative yes so like you said before here and\nI'm having sufficient liquidity in your account not having to sell into a declining market would've does is it really protects your cafes or at least hopefully that's what that's really what the goal is the goal is to do that as well too you're right um I get our phone lines are over we love to hear from you I think everybody's asleep it's cool\nReady for a very rapid breaking their leather\nWell you know and also I think it's a sunrise thing too I mean sunrise didn't come up to date until almost seven o'clock has late\nAnd it's really kind of cool outside your family here night six nine key T.

[noise] so where you want to go next ... well\nI Know that while you are enjoying your time in Arizona I met last thought and Sally [noise]\nDid you did are they doing\nWell these are new Bob and Sally oh okay well that's great they're related to the other ... of our past exactly\nThey're related in this way okay they can't wait to retire so [laughter] that's how they relate first time I heard that this day that's exactly right and is it a pretty cool wonder both sixty six K\nRough currently where the grownups say our normal retirement age\nSally wants out she is ready to leave as soon as possible we've heard that one before that Bob stopped for a couple more years\nThat's what she says [laughter]\nI think she made Bob say that okay I figured that may have been threats before they came in I have no part of that\nYou know it's kind of interesting because a lot of times we're visiting with folks you it's usually the other way which is ... you don't know how that is ready to write those words are the way it was like no I Love my work on it because she doesn't want to be at home with them\nWell this person well Sally is a genius yes because not only does she get to retire but she's going to send ... to work for at least two more years\nBut yeah it's good we'd like this exactly\nSo they chat it ... and I and we found out that um they're spending about three thousand dollars a month\nOkay so the question was well really actually Sally question was how quickly can average higher and I know you're thinking star star I was thinking well let's see well\nMake it happen with Sally it also bothers Sally here we're ... or they\nKnow they were not they have they did an incredible job over their lifetimes of ... of their working life saving they have over a million dollars in assets but the cool thing is is that\nAlmost a quarter of that is an after tax money so they have some extra liquidity that many people that are approaching retirement do not have because\nUm we all follow the conventional wisdom of such take put as much as we can into our retirement accounts if there have been able to take the tax deduction on the front end and oftentimes that leaves very little of additional savings in savings accounts or um brokerage accounts that are not inside of qualified polish plans\nBut Bob and Sally has two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of after tax dollars which can be very helpful in the future\nYou know I think we're going to talk a few minutes about in in a few minutes about um what do they do with all that cash\nThat's right the first we have to talk about the levers on line one\nBob Bob's on the line right and he was really a question that you had okay Bob good afternoon or good morning it looks like afternoon out their welcome to the show\nThank you [laughter] yeah I'm really confused that I've heard advertised on TV quite a bit but uh [noise] I don't grasp the concept how can they return your premiums than on it just doesn't make any sense to me\nBob I mean what happens is is that a way you were what they do is is that you pay an extra premium\nBall on top of the normal term insurance premiums typically level premium ... contract and so what happens is is that if you don't use it over ten twenty Thirty years with they'll then do is they take that extra prune they invest that money for you and then they hand it all back to you or at the end of the day\nAnd they usually invest that in the insurance companies asset right\nSo it's a return of ... if you don't use the contract\nSo you have to pay a premium to get this benefit which is how they're able to do it right\nOh you pay an extra premium to get\nTheir premiums exact there's always a catch ... I'm sure [laughter] well I mean but let's be real here because\nWe know the term insurance is really very similar to if you want to think of it\nYou're like or homeowners your auto insurance if you don't wreck your car you don't collect anything well term is saying well if you don't do you collect from the insurance company so they're saying give us a little extra will invest that over a long period of time\nAnd if you are right and we're wrong or would've cruises will give your money back but again they've had to use your money for a long period of time sadly exactly so I Hope that helps you\nDon't have to wait until the term runs out to cash in hand for the return or your premiums\nIt's because of his age right that is correct so everyone turning sixty five be aware that the premium goes up one to five percent annually and that doesn't include what he's paying for Medicare either it doesn't include only paying for Medicare also doesn't include his prescription drug plan which is thirty dollars a month\nSo we're looking at like three sixty a month yeah\nAnd that works out folks just four thousand three hundred dollars a year\nA lot of money it's it's it's certainly yes so it's more than my cable bill and that's a lot of money\nSo it's more and more capable\nAnd that's a lot of money [noise]\nSo when we sat down with James and chatted with him about his current health care situation he mentioned to me that he's seen a physician once a week he's seeing a pain management specialist once a week before it is not fun for a couple of reasons one because you're in pain but to\nIf you're if you have something like ... you have to pay a co pays every single time you go there you go but here's the kicker which is he's paid forty three hundred dollars annually\nFor his premiums for his supplement uh-huh maximum out of pocket on a Medicare Advantage plan is thirty four hundred dollars\nAnd so you're getting to\n... or I'm getting to the co pay part so even in the worst case scenario let's say poor James has to see the physician every single week every week of twenty Nineteen\nOr what should be paying while he's going to pay forty dollars a visit to the time of year that two thousand eight hundred two thousand eighty dollars\nAnd all that money\nAll that hard that's all that money is applied to his maximum out of pocket which is about thirty four hundred dollars depending upon what policy issues are a lot of different options out there this year so even if he saw the physician once a week even if he had some other care that he needed he's still\nA thousand dollars away from the maximum out of pocket and two thousand dollars away from the premium that he's been paid so you could have the same access to care the same use of care and then a lotta situations you're still going to save money\nThat's fabulous and this doesn't even include\nAll of the extra benefits that many of these policies offer\nHearing aid assistance Medicare does not cover the devices some companies do offer hearing aid assistance ... dental assistant so cleaning exams and X. rated and some companies have even expanded that to include\nA certain types of dental work ... um feelings extraction bridges crowns those types of things that you know people need like over ... silver sneakers\nLike every ... like ... which is\nYou know forty bucks could be forty dollars a month because that's a free gym membership you can join any Jimmy like that but I Do as many as you like that except the silver sneakers plan\n[noise] twenty five dollar there are some companies that offer over the counter benefits for the overthrow like covered but United in essence also offered this as well in school um\nMoney that you can use to pay for over the counter counter items like\nAnything from cue tips to their attack to chap stick band aids\nYou order it out of the uh insurance companies catalog they mail it to you know extra charge to use some companies do it mostly some do it on a quarterly basis but that some extra benefit to you that it was you know and her bucks here and also\nCoventry specifically added this and it's a very I think this would be considered as a unique benefit also very specific one [noise]\nShe'll come and tree noted Coventry sent out a questionnaire to its members and ... they are constantly asking and I know the the other insurance companies do this as well [noise]\nWhat what do you need what do you like about the plan what do you dislike about the plan what would you like to see at it and so in the upcoming year what are they have added specifically to their benefits are twelve near meals\nPost admitted to the hospital get outta here so what that means is if you've been admitted to the hospital\nWhen you're discharged and you go home you can call Coventry and they will send you twelve meals pre made in\nA cooler type container you put it in the fridge and then you have access to it\nFor you know that's almost a week's worth of meals and what they determined was that people were being re admitted to the hospital after it bitten because in some cases if you happen to be on your own and you you can't eat well after you've been in the hospitals\nEspecially because you know the strength to cook and overcome a store for\nExaggerating ... will because you can't and a lot of situations and that's also you know if you don't have sustenance that's hurting your ability to recover so Coventry added this benefit which is very cool ah for people that have been you know discharged from the hospital and obviously anyone can use it even if you you know you're married and\nYou know who your grandkids will come visit you 'cause you're ...\nTakes you have one of them are pre made meals but it's a very I think it's a very nice extra benefit and the thing that it into\nTheir policies and I'm very cool thing about open enrollment is that you have the opportunity to not only look at the medical benefits and the prescription drug benefits that you currently have and see how they compare\nTo other option but there are cases where some of the these and celery benefit can really make a big difference in what you're paying every year because a lot of people don't think about\nThose trips to the wall to wall greens or CBS every once in a while or you pick up the chap stick you pick up the cue tips to that kind of thing or the allergy medicine that you're constantly taking in St Louis\nI'm as part of your medical expense but if we can cut some of that out\nWe know that prescriptions can be more expensive under Medicare so let's do some cost shifting if you can save some money on your over the counter\nOr on your dental or on your trips to the gym we can use those that do those dollars to offset the cost of potentially increase price on your prescriptions\nIn ... here and what strikes me sixty will use the\nMedicare is awesome and I know making it was obviously in conjunction with these are close [noise] I Know that it's a scary proposition to change health plans especially when you've been used to even if you're poor way you're currently consuming healthcare ... and then having to make this change\nOn to the government primarily country will controlled Medicare plan the rules\nEt cetera [noise] son ... every week\nWell what I like to say when people say oh wow that sounds too good to be true how does it really work\nIf you think about the fact that front ... from the very first paycheck you ever received you have been paying into Medicare so your entire working life you've spent paying for this benefit\nYou should get something back for it and so and you continue to pay for it because however you've selected whatever supplement you've selected for to supplement your Medicare coverage you still have to pay the Medicare part B premium\nFor the rest of your life so you paid in your entire working life and now you're going to continue to pay while you have the coverage\nThat's why Medicare can cover about eighty percent of your medical expenses and the only rule that you play in terms of covering the remaining twenty percent of its figuring out how you want to pay for it you want to pay for it up front like James was doing before paying three hundred and thirty dollars a month or do you want to pay for it as you actually consume the services\nWhere in some cases you may be paying less\nTo consume care every single week than you'd pay the insurance company to say okay I don't want to have to have a co pay and when I go see the pain management doctor\nAnd it is interesting about dreams as the tuition is because she would have\nEver have you retarded normal retirement age ... turn over the years ago ... probably because the Medicare Advantage plans really weren't really weren't around and frankly they weren't very good\nProbably because the Medicare Advantage plans really weren't really weren't around and frankly they weren't very\nGood they weren't as good as they have been in the last six years\nExactly so what happens is like many folks who you're on a plan a plan for ... and now they're proves you're getting big with Medicare Advantage plans and networks have grown as a benefit to have a land is being an end you out of pocket max we're coming down to the real algebra heroes in this case he decided to go ...\nThat's exactly right because we can say with certainty that even if he were to sooner and the worst case scenario not only is he ... the pain management specialist once a week but he's also you know something else happened and he hit the thirty four hundred dollars out of pocket maximum\nThat still less than the forty three hundred dollars that he paid in premium and he doesn't have any less access to care he doesn't have any difference in care from what he had before because Oxford that's exactly right because\nAll of\nThe supplement or Medicare Advantage plans or prescription drug plans that are offered are offered by private insurance companies but they all have government contracts which means\nThey all have to follow the rules and regulations of Medicare they have to provide the benefits that Medicare lays out to you so that means that even if you've selected a Medicare Advantage plan and you're using a network like you used to use when you were employed\nYou still have the same access to care the networks are required to be large they cannot create narrow networks like many people here about for individuals under sixty five years old for and what do you like\nThe folks that an hour and stuck with a\nYou know or an better where they have very limited before to health care plan alternative exactly they have limited and they have limited networks and also limited numbers of physicians that will accept the policy that Medicare Advantage plans are not allowed to do that because they have to follow Medicare guidelines and also if you select\nYou hear about the

out for the Wonder Years you'll be it'll be ... next spring\nOkay well this is it time to do is darned leaves started dropping oh yeah and a fringe got one of my favorite picture and I'm a guy who writes I I Know I've I've got my neighbors that there's got to leave floors\nOr or or\nAll day oh yeah I I use the sheet\nOr and and my daughter doesn't really notice it when you put it back on her

rubber ripped on top and where your hands goes I don't get the ah blisters on your hand that strikes band or we also have to Yes sir\nJohn I'm Sorry to interrupt but I'm I'm trying to picture you raking leaves into a big pile\nAnd then on to them well I don't I have a I have a dog who likes to run through them and I I have a seven year old granddaughter and a half my grandson starts running and time this year a then he'll probably going to um to yeah but uh you go\nYou know I just I've always liked raking it better than that I tried blowing it I I have a blow for my construction so we're working places we can clean out but I I just\nIt's raking because it gets all those little particles out and all that kind of goes up because in when I I found such you if you have a dog\nAnd they leave your presence in the yard oh yeah and then you've got to represent the leaves around it's kinda hard to find those broken unless you find them ... and ... but the other side of the coin is because those presidents many times killed the grass and then leaves get down in there and they're wet leaves\nAnd if you don't ... they're never going to get out and then the grass dies over the winter time seeing them come back and bring it all these holes right\nThis way you get all that stuff out of those spots on your grass skied can grow them drive\nThere's something satisfying about

S. let's go\nTo Dave he's on the line there thanks for calling the inside of that show how are you today [noise]\nFine gentleman a\nDive really appreciate your show I enjoy listening every week when I get a chance to thank you I've got\nTwo questions author was to show it on her hands\nAnd yard is in the sand\nSand is there and put some kind of a spurs tree in the backyard or yards only fifty feet wide so I'd like to put something when we got a call river in one corner\nLike put something that would cover for the birds you know during the wintertime for Mr Shay\nHouses Thirteen Years old we have the manufactured for joy St\nLouis we can only put certain type of wine on it that it wouldn't support the weight of like say a ceramic or Cory dial it depends on the type of things that are under there is there any truth to that or you know I thought that just somebody\nI find it hard to ... we use manufactured for all the time whether it's a wood for trust where there's a TGI which is a piece of plywood with what looks like a two by three on top and two or three in the bottom a ... those are made for residential pouring a if you have three quarter plywood on top of that\nUh then you are you really need is another layer of quarter or half inch I recommend a half inch um Iraq\nOn top of that and the tile on top of that if you're going to a trial the foreign manufacturers towel tour manufactures recommended mention a quarter of sickness to put their later Kyla so you won't get your cracking\nOkay now there's also a product called deep there's also a product called ... which is a it it it looks like a plastic map that's got a little a lot of bumps in which you you glue that down to the free quarter plywood floor\nAnd then you ... back down I should say and then use your mortar layer tile on top of that if there's if there's some movement in the floor the mat will break away from the floor but won't break or a child so you won't get the cracks and your joints so there's a couple of different ways of doing it\nOkay for trees is there any type of spurious you would recommend Mr saying I mean I'm not sure what yeah I Do you deliver and plant down in a herculean ...\nUh yes we do we have a minimum of of course but generally most of our trees by the time you buy a five or six or seven eight foot tree of you'll get a pastor minimum but sand in itself is really not a problem with the plant and I would say\nWell I've been in a lot of sand with my sandwiches and balls and I I have a hard time getting out yeah you\nGet out but you know you'd probably why they really incorporate some of the like St Louis composting is raised our garden mix that it possibly and build a little bit of a ... but if you add a lot of good nutrition Newt nutrition organic material and the this mix has soil and complex and what he\nDid a big hole in the use some of the compost in that\nYou would want it back to some of that and maybe planted a little bit high because ... usually have a lot of rock to I mean you might Sam but there might be a lot of rock underneath that but if you go and build a build a nice little ... burn especially if you're trying for privacy by adding a little bit of this a\nCompost and soil mixture you can get something to grow up because the good side of it is that Sam will drain well and as long as you keep water to it and you know water the plant regularly\nIt's going to drain while and then most of the uh Christmas trees and things are growing up in Michigan and things and they have a very Sandy soil up there in a lot of areas that grow a evergreens and things and they grow very quickly that what it is it's very easy for them to route through the sand [noise]\nUh you know during the course of the year you'd want to go ahead and fertilize that a tree well because uh\nYou know during the course of the year you'd want to go ahead and fertilize that a tree well because again\nYou're growing in Santa so you might want to throw some organic fertilizer they used to be okay but normally supposed to be a good one\nNorway or maybe like serving insurers\nSerbian not so much they they they kind of a ... if you're in a kind of wide open area they they like a little shade protection they might burn a bit and they're kind of slow growing a little touchy\nBut I Would go with a a probably a Norway spruce or you know possibly some sort of a you know what time maybe a white pine or a Bosnian pine something like that\nStock this time of year yes we do that we're getting a lot of that kind of mentor in this time of year\nI'll be out to check it out and see what you\nSay ... thanks to have you have a great day and we've got to have on them I don't know why are you doing today\nI Am getting wow there's so many different first says\nYeah yeah I think that makes them I really do it just keeps coming up again and I'm telling you [laughter] okay now you're outside the last time we are inside the last time we talk on a beautiful day now it's cool out Saturday outside\nThan inside yeah we're we're going to stay quiet just it's just oh it's called she had a winter coat on a in\nA winter coat on high heels with no shoot you know sock it there's a good ... yeah\nA guy like catch my goodness so folks this is Debbie roses are designers construction and design a week she calls in one we have a show when the Missouri's not playing and hopefully they're going to win against Alabama yeah go\nGo roll tide go tigers anyway is out today what are we talking about today did\nWell because you're getting cold feet are getting cold I Am talking about ... oh yeah oh yeah ... ... ... in your bathroom is that she couldn't make\nIt there is no better for in a bathroom than a warm floor but they're not just for bathrooms anymore\nTruly not in fact we're doing at project now over just across and um we're putting a warm floor underneath their electric luxury downtown and you have to do that too\nThere's a lot of people are laying around a little our kitchen floor surgical too so\nIt's not like Jay Leno for but across space or if you're putting a ruined the sitting on piers is always going to be colder because airs blown underneath that is never have the warmth\nOf a basement so this is going to keep your feet or nice yeah room warmer all all winter long and\nIf you have delicate feet like Debbie and and you know because you can turn a warm for up against this high of one of my bathroom and it goes anywhere from about Seventy five to Ninety in mind right now is it eighty Debs is is pushing Ninety four\nI think it was like Ninety\nBut we have an matter wherever clients who lays her her neck down on the floor of the bathroom she gets up and so when she gets home she puts it on it's like having a radiator when we were growing up nice you know they work really well they don't costs costs a lot of money you know costs a lot of money to run because it's a low voltage\nBecause once you get into his temperature ... in science is it's not like something you get drawn\nIn five minutes every one of your that far it takes a good twelve hours to get it up the temperature and those days there that the puppy would love and oh yeah oh yeah so what I had the ... above my pay about three weeks ago when I had the addict that on and the cool air is coming in I don't have a timer on my
