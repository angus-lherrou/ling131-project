weird\n... that will be filling in along with max and me\nShe knows right it will be a weird that's one of those jobs you know a great show a lot going on as we said and there was a there was just you angered our producer I Know\nThis is so interesting that there was a story in the week a couple that met his kids at Saint Jude Scott married nearly Thirty years later and max said you want to tell us about this next\nYear so everyday we all since source one another about potential topics that we can talk about on the show to colds and all that kinda stuff cultural\nBreads and a personal story about this uh these two people who had met\nA Thirty Years' previous at St Jews and then Thirty years later they got married to one another at the same location and it's one of those all stories and I realized when I read the story I I got angry and I thought why am I a horrible person why why do I get angry when I hear these stories make everybody else say oh and then\nJohn did therapy on you and what we got to the bottom of it and it made me feel a whole lot better than I could perhaps be an awful person but not because of this\nNo no not because of this because uh they're it will go into the reasons why you earn over ... early era lots of them\nBut really what it comes down to is the the stories like this I think when when people attempt to make some kind of all moment happened which is trying to create a magic that doesn't exist in\nEl manufactured off right like you I was talking about manufactured rain lately\nYeah and it it it it sort of a ... story would infer that these two people were meant to\nBe exactly and and that that angers me because there's no such thing as soul mates and other ridiculous concept like\nThat and what I told him was a story about my parents because my parents when they were very very young uh had no idea until much later on they had been married for about ten years before they got older the grandparents together\nAnd my grandparents are older both sets of their parents got together for a family get together like you do but my grandparents and my my dad's side they lived in Hawaii So they were almost never around which is why it took so long to get us at ... you know everybody together and they were sitting down and talking like you do\nAnd it turned out that they lived in the same a housing project after the war in North buffalo and ah that's that's kinda cool so they started telling more stories and it was I mean they live right near each other so they called my dad over and they said um what do you remember about living insured and park side\nAnd he said uh oh you've maybe he was probably four or five when they moved away from everybody said I remember there was this kid this older kid\nAnd I used to go over to his apartment and we really didn't hang up much but he would let me come over because he had rabbits and my dad liked the rabbits is or three or four year old so he would go over and look at the rabbits and you know and then go out and be a three or four year old image of what else do you remember about that apartment\nAnd he said I remember every time I went over there to see the rabbits there was a baby cry\nAnd uh it wouldn't stop and it was I mean it was without fail every time I went over there was a baby cry and they started laughing and they told him that the kid who had the rabbits is my uncle Tony and the baby is my mom [laughter] but here's the\nEnd of that story is that after twenty two years of marriage got divorced so that that idea that somehow has an expiration date well right and and the idea is you know people would hear the first part of that story and they would like max that they were all look it was meant to\nOn Katie are at [noise]\nLive\nMy view is we have made it

it's white Kimberly are opening a grocery store where things are free paper and neat and I got very excited about it\nBut it's very exciting to catch the catch is [noise] but I usually\nAnd his wife first of all are worth Ninety five million dollars they open the open the store the cause one point to open their depending on the public to raise all this money and it was just simply on the board of directors now my mother works at a food bank\nThey work out of a single or a trailer outside of the church and they the four days a week a hundred people this project that brat and his wife are taking all this great credit for hope to feed\nPeople that day the first year that's nuts and eight\nOr nine to five million and he's not putting any money out on their\nDad's where yeah you're right I'm Glad you called that up because if that's the case that something terribly wrong especially if he's going to put his name on and get that out there\nTo grant being very proud of themselves and his wife a place called the store and again they need one point two million people to open a shiny new place it reminds me recently the Budweiser five million dollars promoting the fact that they gave away a hundred thousand dollars worth of water\n[laughter] yeah right the watering can sure\nSo I'm calling out breath basically you know\nI completely indifferent towards music or whatever but don't you know and that's why I don't get me about this unless you you know you've got Ninety five mil\nAt least put up a middle to get this thing go and they need to rethink what doing about meeting people their goal for the first year three thousand people here that point to\nA point you'd be ... and and that's you know uh and then that that whole idea of patting yourself on the back I like the stories much better where you find out you know somebody finds out accidentally celebrity behind something\nLike John Doe or John what's her name on job we did in New Jersey it really didn't promote that everyone else did but him you\nKnow let's move on to another another celebrity chef sham okay this is a crazy thing and I think she's a nice person is and the other but she's being held at the ship quote unquote and I was looking I look at old who'd articles I look at it sugar\nAnd one of her recipes and promoting is chicken pot pie\nSeasonal writing it out of the nation\nPot pie and realize that the inside of it is already a suit you know you have to do is take that pie crust to make a basket with it I mean this is what you got to pay attention to\nYou have to do is take the pie crusts to make a basket with it I mean this is what you got to pay attention to where you're spending your cookbook money\nRight there you go now I just want to chicken pot pie though\nNow let's go to something that really matters coal foods Amazon Prime foreign go any further that you have to be those\nI looked at I look on their ad for some kind of deal 'cause remember I went there last week for the first time yeah first time in a long time I looked at they have a sale right now and I'm just going to reach what it says it's five no known about for a boneless Serling steak and its animal welfare rated\nI mean these are on the previews or something I\nGuess it means they follow certain standards on whatever but to name something animal welfare waited first thing I thought about this humane society it sounds so how what's wrong with this picture right\nRight well it sounds like something they made up themselves really using any animal rating\nAnd since we do get a lot of our food from Amazon is that and the other hope but let's not get to a head of giving ... on the back John I'm sure you've covered that this week the people he's giving Fifteen dollars an hour or two will no longer get bonuses and they can no longer get stock options\nAre told us about that a couple of days ago so you know that's\nNot you know and plus they're going to automate happened those job soon\nYeah so let's not get too out of herself also this has turned into the fight for Fifteen dollars for fast food again Amazon Prime is starting to spend ten dollars a month for them now there's ESPN and CBS and all these other networks and which is pay more money\nAnd now this is going to drive fast food prices everything else up but they aren't going to be able to automate like he is so this guy the devil\nYou know what the answer is we all have to learn how to become robot repairman\nTell me if they're\nThe largest beep recall in history this week six and a half million pounds\nWhen was the only way to\nGet ready to jump I don't know what's going on anymore\nWe're children we'd only read our food and it's ridiculous\nWe can't control anything but here's something we can't control it is now a law Austin, Texas restaurants can no longer throw it away they have to find a way to give it to people who are hungry or use it for compost\nGood great\nThat some ... here's something that's got to shock all it'd be OK chip away searching for a new phone safety head you know that position that that person who's got it now is headed for two and a half\nYears when\nProblems grumbling about two years yeah [noise]\nThey're getting people yeah people embedded with their food pictures sure people are getting mothers and getting quote unquote or parents would ever are getting competitive up their children's school\nLunches competitive that they're better than others are worse\nPictures up and trying to ... you know making that I think\n... are you kidding me\nYeah I remember the lunches with my school I wouldn't be the tea\nI Love the school lunches you remember John saying we didn't have much food at my house like we did the ear so [laughter]\nIt's kind of important to put in class warfare into this\nDamn straight days was lunch school pizza with a leather cheese on top and I loved it gave me the name leather eh cheese\nAnd you can use it do don't\nGet trying to get rid of the name doughnuts in there and I try to help obesity because sort of Tobar picked the seventh you can get free going at a even though it's not called don't condone anymore doing it fries with ice coffee purchase how much sugar is that going to be\nOh wow I mean just the coffee alone is going to be three hundred calories that's close to a grand piano nuts trying yeah\nNice to\nTalk of French writes a stupid idea of credit dominoes were what credit do dominoes it wasn't that but one of the pizza drivers and saved a woman from being kidnapped\nUh-huh did you see that that was awesome\nYou know do we know what happened to the driver your stories like this all the time where they end up popping the driver\nI have not being able I have not followed up on that yet I just saw that with this one aspect of it good and uh but I Will all up next week and I hope it's all been", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "05"}
