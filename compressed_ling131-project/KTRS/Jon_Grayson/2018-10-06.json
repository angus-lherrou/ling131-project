higher every one I might kill a hard Richard didn't ... alongside I don't think he stayed in any differently is really one of those days where you have to ... minutes to cruise to\nRe no question about it I think a lot of us looking ahead to this game at the start of the season you check out the schedule you pointed to this one really as a pivotal\nAgain both these teams looking to be Stark's if you will in the eastern division challenging George Li both already played George and last but still in the mix for a lot of things not just in the division but a winning season ballgames positioning [laughter] I think too pretty evenly matched programs most people consider this game a toss up coming in\nShould be good when they've had a very good seriousness Missouri's joined the SEC very close games\nWe know this from the injury standpoint is that there'll be a different starting quarterback for South Carolina\nAnd it looks as though much ... going to get the nod today at quarterback and uh you know he hasn't really started let me play a whole lot to offer this damage but still you know he's going to be prepared is the big game for both teams are let's just see it was raised up for the challenge\nWell Missouri's also do to prepare for degree and join our security and joint or who's depressed the quarter back to the really the fans around here have been excited about seeing but he's more of a run type guy but again if you see them in the game you have to be prepared for those type of place\nYeah he's the people's choice a very highly regarded recruit at a book Charleston South Carolina home state kid again ... the redshirts seniors in this program for years Steve Spurrier recruited in South Carolina he is not play much will it must have small collie and this week says\nHe throws a good football he just hasn't been tested much and I'll say this I mean obviously starting quarterback out of significant news family's been really good for the Carolina and really ...\nGot a significant news family's been really good for the Carolinas and really does it against Missouri the last two years bill Koch when\nI was going to go back and said why is misery happy not just Egypt mentally will as a freshman at sixteen Seventy eight point six percent of his passes were completed they went thirty one Twenty one Williams price for a year later in Columbia, Missouri while\nHe throws for one eighty seven thirty one thirty but the difference in that game really where the momentum shifted was would Missouri made the mistake of kicking the ball ...\nAnd we saw that is a guy ... you just got to be smart kicking especially when you see him back in a position to catch to get away from ... out of the stadiums you get into the next day or whatever you do is let him get his hands on the\nWar is like Larry Smith a greater part don't offend Kelly of course in Boulder, Colorado some years ago to defend Kelly took it a hundred yards back for a touchdown\nAnd it was an early 'cause you'd miss All right so let's talk about Missouri in his games typically from a defensive standpoint because if you look at it Howard so much of a of winning football is played in the trenches ride those who dominate the wind a scrimmage usually when the game's jury is not clean\nBehind the line of scrimmage on the defensive side they're not getting a great surgeon not getting many sex only five to four games only Twenty one sacrifice last\nHow do you get more push up on\nYou know it might take desire of regardless of what you've been coached to do when it comes down on Saturdays about putting pressure of getting sick quarterbacks face rattling him\nOr were you do it whether it's a pressure comes from the inside and you force the model pockets to the right to the left pressure promos outside in creating a field by way of ... you know so if you if you're going to send the Blitzer someone's gotta come free watching to feed your and your fiber front or maybe you're six there are a flock of protecting them\nFaster and you know what happens if you got I'm Sorry you know what happens Christian to broker a frog is usually can create something like perhaps the turnover in Missouri is minimal forced to turn over twelve consecutive regular\nSeason specially with a young man again all to get a red shirt senior but making his first collegiate start gets passed rush on him that can be a huge I'll tell you I think Caroline is starting receivers at least the two are as good a tandem as there are no Georgia Alabama they got a lot of good ones in more depth\nBrian Edward ... should be good to go today and the poor mentioned debo Samuel I mean those are huge threats on the outside but it's been tight in\nThe last couple of match up to the game ... of absolutely burn misery eight and ... just to go to the NFL stole\nThe same thing their hands on guy coming off the line of scrimmage don't let them free released down the field if you do that a point now you've got a chance you know I just can't allow chiefs or whatever they want to do on the office when someone's got to pay attention to that one of those down to ... only because I think it's\nGoing to be interesting to to watch both ... says there's this game progressed as and see what Ryan Walters those or Missouri and see what the Carolina you've got to do in terms of water they're going to show the quarter back you know where the young quarterback are you coming after him all the time\nWith a group like drew walk may not happen receivers that are the one hundred percent but who you choose to give ... a lot of different things to get the ball out of his hands or what I think that that just meant to be worth watching I really\nThink it shapes up as a fascinating game you know and to imitate the coach out and they're all big games the only place twelve and a regular station but this matchup intriguing for so many ways and I think we're in for a really entertaining afternoon

Carolina have had a good series folks who brings ... for the Missouri Lennox apartments take us inside the numbers yet I was thinking of\nThree of the last five games have been won by Carolina including the last two but you look among those five games again Cox overtime win in Columbia, Missouri Missouri Missouri Tigers have at one point when you're in Columbia South Carolina so teams in the last five years one on each other's field\nThat closed competitive games that I just have a feeling we may see another one of those today\nIs a great to be with you again and I would agree I think that uh you know when you're a new program coming into a ... I Know you you don't have a built in rivalry with anybody in my opinion is that uh this is due south Carolina uh football's series is one of the better ones are in terms of rivalry in\nRamos so far that we've seen so I agree that uh the developing burgeoning rivalry if you will and uh I personally would prefer a blow out when the tigers today but the wireless there'll be like you guys already here okay with that all the drama hops fiery around my area and the good news for Missouri the tigers\nHave shown a precedent for like good football on the road of war game road winning streak currently put the Missouri Tigers dating back last season\nOf yeah the number there as far as you mentioned it in a you know the mark of a good team is winning on the road as often as you can obviously it is much more difficult to to getting a winning hostile territory there's really not much more satisfying and in all sports in doing that\nThe ones who are allowed place than fighting them down early or at least at the end of the game but\nYet doctors have won four straight road games\nUh and that is active streak is tied for ... among our five teams in the country coming in today Georgia\nIs next and the SEC is most of the SEC Jordan has won three straight Oklahoma has a real strength only about one Seventeen straight road games going in the day of course they're neutral site today we can to access but\nAnd then uh the zoo recently had an eleven game road ... pretty good on their ourselves from us to thousands searching the two thousand so\nObviously you need one day to keep that going to mention that eleven in a row on the road from two thousand Thirteen to Fifteen of course that includes two SPCA east championship seasons but\nThat is something else flying and this leads to that well on the road and as you pointed out currently the longest road winning streak and for the SEC ahead of Georgia with three well Missouri's off and it's a really a show some things against the Georgia Bulldogs they're against the good football team I Know the tigers up some pretty good numbers than I\nDid uh the number I I wrote down as one Seventy two and that was the number of rushing yarns determines who had against\nGeorgia [noise] and and you know that might not be earth shattering numbers if you will but the average\nUh over four\nPoint six yards carry in for rushing touchdown against George in that game and uh if you look at what George in as Dona ... against their other four games combined [noise] um [noise] they didn't give up a single rushing touchdown held opponents to just over three yards to carry [noise] um and\nUh you know so it was a loss obviously so you take away what you can positive out of it and I've certainly to me that was a positive that the kind of got so the ground is that going a little bit and then you look at a comparatively if you want to see what South Carolina did against Georgia these\nThese teams that played George already this year in South Carolina only random offer fifty yards stores are back here in Williams rice a few weeks ago a new Russian touchdown so and then you look at South Carolina ... against Russia soccer's going up against the eighty fifth rank rushing beef us today\nThe gave up over a hundred and Seventy yard I gave up to Seventy one to Georgia so anyway all all that\nBeing that a Missouri is going to try to establish their own money on that if they can have some success early to see how that plays out that would\nMake sense especially because you look at South Carolina's numbers so hard against the past the getting caught the fences don't quite well against opponents passing\nYeah they do the numbers ... eleven and that's where a South Carolina ranks nationally\nYeah they do the numbers ... eleven and that's where South Carolina ranks nationally and they're all the are the eleventh rang deepened theme of the country coming into the day they give up just a hundred and sixty yards in the air\nNow you can make numbers out to be whatever you want a and those of us one of these things has double industry knew that her all the time but ah they gone against\nWell they haven't exactly played murderers row of a threat to ask me is that so [noise] um\nGeorgia in Erbil Kentucky\nHighest ranked any of us passing attacks are is the first one you've got a Seventy six one Seventeen yourself\nAgain a little perspective there are a little perspective on it does appear to be the string thirty points at this point so tigers will be tested there I'm sure of course Mitch who comes in with a seventh rank passing office in the car so it's kind of a strike against the strength of the world today by\nWell here's here's the big category I think we can say this or just about any game this series in particular last couple of years Missouri in South Carolina has come down to turnovers turnovers turnovers are we\nTalking about it all the time um you know you look at these last two years to South Carolina has been on\nHere in Williams rice and she was sixteen and last year in Colombia [noise] um they've\nReally been even game statistically when you look at the numbers the big disparity has been an turnovers tigers about gay in South Carolina each of those last few games by ... years ago and by some of your last year\nBut of course lost by ten here [noise]\nSixteen and a by seeing last year in Colombia [noise]\nTo me the big reason is their mind is that the turnover category those two and a giving all the way ...\nGenes and getting known and there are a self uh you know two and a half hours but all the time and they let us that are ... more than a turnover stuff in the game talks to do it a good job of capitalizing is they turn\nThose turnovers in each of those games are touched down so twenty eight oh is that the charity\nAny sort of a margin between those two years so [noise] uh tigers obviously need to take care of all today [noise] and uh you know not just leaving factor in last year that kickoff return Samuel has so he turned it all over three times against South Carolina give us a kickoff return for touchdown and that's a recipe for a day like tigers\nLeading that game nothing then came the return of the ... and I'm really snowballed against Missouri back at ... All right how about some miscellaneous numbers as we wrap up the say\nThe random things to your wanting to do as a number and that is the number of passing yards with ... to reach ten thousand yards or his career\nAnd uh that would make you need one hundred and twelve quarterback in in the division one history to reached in thousand yards and he would be the end of the state quarterback also pushed that she\nWas a twenty two there the next number is Thirteen and that is ... scoring average in the last six games that much to his face will must channel that's either a head coach or defensive I warn everyone was back and was he was doing well that'll be interesting\nI showed him about that in our grief is on the field you know a couple of the fence of mine did coaches and it'll be like some respects must champ quite a bit of fact they were just visiting moments ago as a\nField you know six games now against the must chance coach team Missouri average age is Thirteen points whether he was the head coach and they were saying something that's a good example size yeah absolutely so\nObviously he's known as a a defense of mind in a you know I guess the point you bring that up is just to to you know new perspective ... cops just for a lot of other ones against a senior so hopefully is going to have a little more successful in that today the last number was for a while I was in my estimation on the number of times we'll hear sandstorms day\nUh maybe go on tour at might be a little little much but it will seem like it is not as annoying consumers to have that to the to the record as yeah nine Seventy five for it on our pretty sure one time well that might have we remember the Nineteen eighties got away from the are\nUp about that chat and\nAppreciate is always your time and I really do like illusion miscellaneous numbers as we wind up saying when you really bring in a secure thank you sir Medicare as we should look we'll have fun jazz already said he's not kidding he's got the sunscreen already they've got something on the tiger sideline I missed it\nAgainst the Georgia game and his paying the price for a good week so only once\nBut twice head Miller and I we're ready for the bright Sun City as warm as\nRoad cones or elements Bloody Sunday aging or local ranks Steeler getting the ... with the DIY age is the case now you don't come back slash tigers fan by board in your ... dealers\nSome at least\nThe shelter insurance pre game show like Kelly back in Columbia South Carolina or Missouri getting set to take on the game ... South Carolina we get a chance to visit with tiger's head coach burial to going to be warm on today isn't it [noise]\nIs and we we anticipated you look at long term forecast and you never know how it's going to turn out but it'll be a low nineties and so obviously in the stadium will be a lot warmer than that but er\nA low nineties and so obviously in the stadium will be a lot warmer than that but our our kids are prepared for it uh we we started talking about hydration and and mentally being ready to um go play in this environment you know long long before the balls being kicked off\nThis is one of the loudest environments in college football what are some of the things as a team you try to\nDo to prepare for that well we've been in practice you you try to provide an environment with music or you know we we put its as many\nSpeakers as we could pack on the on the back of the gate or and it followed are often that's just really the entire week uh you know the the um [noise]\nThat that's one way you got to be able to to do a great job on not only continue with your verbal communication but also hand signals and and this at the end of the day make sure everybody's on the same page your quarterback\nWho's twenty two yards away\nFrom a historic milestone of ten thousand yards past he began his career only chief Daniel has done that in uh Missouri uniform only one hundred and eleven quarterbacks before him have done that as well when when I talk about a milestone what drew walk what what comes to mind\nWas um I'm excited for ... that he's reached the point that um [noise]\nHis name was going to be left in the retro record books for forever I'm you know anytime that you mentioned with chase Daniel ... who then you know that you're doing a plane at a pretty high level uh drew\nWill will still said remove all those give me a win and and that's what I Want to be known as as as a winner so\nI'm excited for him excited for a team to be able to be part of that but I'm more we're also with a grand a view of of how this the team is is so into each other on on trying to get the team accomplishment of of winning the game I'm excited about the approach that they've taken the\nShows that last night and he said to me that drew would cut off both of his arms story on eleven when Susan let's not\nGo there but uh I I Would uh you know we we take the approach of of one game by the time and and continue to prepare was an opportunity and and every single one of them if we do it the right way\n'cause we're both know ... went out last week the quarterback with me in the fourth who's been practicing this week there's been a word that it could be a game during decision between he and Michael's gr neck you but also the freshman seems Max's will really have to prepare for all three don't you think you should and\nAnd then we did um but I think there's a point when you get in the game we can the amount of volume of news now that you get out of the other side\nYou know there there's probably some smoke and mirrors there to uh so for us we need to prepare for all situations no anticipated no\nUm you know the differences in how they're going to call it or run it when when each of those quarterbacks are in there so uh our guys are really good job you know at the end of the day they will be eleven guys out there on both sides of all we'll go play\nWell in addition to that are too as as we both know in this league it's always about what happens up front and want a scrimmage on both sides I flew in a\nChallenge our guys are in those positions all week because they're going to want to end up running the ball so are we are and then who can protect a pastor who didn't get to the pastor um and and that's not all the ... majority of\nIt is ... is a guy who's a true freshman this made some place for you as he surprised at all in what he's been able to do and just his initial season board games and I think\nWe we knew the skill set that he had coming in a through her name but also the ability that he's been able to really learn every position has been a surprise to me um he's he's\nBeyond is yours maturity wise in my opinion
