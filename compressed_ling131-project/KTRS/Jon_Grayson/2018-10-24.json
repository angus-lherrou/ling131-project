with us we're going to talk a little switch gears you were talking a little food with you because well you never have to push my arms of junk food\nOh boy that's true if you're a Baker this is the season in good health into shape and TV house you've probably seen her in the food network a cookbook author and making clean and Ingrid joins us on line ... thanks for joining us\nNow it's\nSo interesting that you grew up in Colombia and the Netherlands and then moved to Miami [laughter]\nI'm like well there's good food and all of those places are you and plenty of influence to draw from true\nSo as we come into this baking season we were talking about pantry yesterday what'd you greedy and since spices should we keep in our pantry [noise]\nYou know I think that's one thing we are the guys at the time for you to try 'em\nOne thing that I always say for the holiday guys is this is not the time for you to try complicated rats the so stick to smart recipes and very basic thing or bad if you have flowered\n... extract meaning and some ... I think you're going to go and besides those basic angry and\nThere's a feeling it and so you definitely need and I would say yeah riding starting with a good mix her and it's a good stern specially for baking you need to separate your ingredients properly\nAnd a hillside sell bats have become like mine go to because they make the cleanup job so much easier than that if you when you don't use them that everything's stick fear baking sheet so I'm definitely those basics are as a smart thing to have\nI can confirm as so bad my wife would not be with her she loves me and I'm not allowed to touch it anymore so\nShe'll tell us about some recipes that you are highlighting and I know that you also wrote a book about Latin comfort foods may healthy correct\nSlapping comfort food clean out the sheriff came out on the market a lesson in ten days ago and it's it's really about taking all the foods that we all love that we've come to you know and that everybody from the Mexicans to a Spanish\nTo all across the board that's available on Amazon and you know I Believe in the age of twenty concept which is\nYou take care of yourself and then of course the holidays are times when dogs to enjoy and I like to think of them aren't recipes and\nEasy breezy and expensive even your child can do them alone and I think that if he sticks to direct the feet like that you're going to really take away a lot of stress and ultimately what people really want the holidays it's common for food\nAid flavors that everybody really too so you know obviously sticking to a delicious um\nWith the lead chips I'm getting ... and that goes a long way from the grown up to the kid does\nOr racing cake not all of these recipes are Fifteen twenty minutes to make\nThe beauty of this apple race okay cause that you can pre make that even two weeks in advance if you want free as long as you feel it airtight then you got to go imagine if you can at least you're either if not more\nOn your side dishes done until we had where every day you just stick want things to make by the time you get to whether it's Thanksgiving or Halloween it's like that day you couldn't just coast and enjoy your day because of the lip thing has been\nDone any good what about cookies how far advanced can you make cookies in how to use during\nWhile you can do even a week in advance his hands do air time\nI like to do airtight and put them in the fridge and the day of you take them out that they can reach room temperature and then for and says I Love doing these um Hussein they checked out in Springfield case\nWhich make them my head but I won't filled them until the minute that I'm going to put them on a youthful tray and decorate it and at that moment I'll just stick to killing them up with a new say they too which really is out of a bottle so that's pretty easy to do\nAnd you know I Love sticking to my room and you can do this because they can't park you can make a week ahead even two weeks again great freeze items but then again let's not forget these are Fifteen minutes for the snow and stuff and at least anyone can make these\nYou know there's so many ingredients as well did you know we have a great Peruvian restaurant here in town or to somebody on a rope in Columbia league really the shelter American influence\nAnd people don't I don't think the new launch between South American food and ah you know Mexican and Central American food but there are things would show up like ... I used is wonderful and then someone you can use or she's cleaner you use it in the desert\nAnd you you just go crazy with him and again they do that's a different you know we differ noticeably different flavor to what you're doing some of the things that you run into the same bill [noise]\nYou know for me I again I Love doing a variety and actually that was a great example that use up the Quincy face to\nDo for their life that we're able to just try and bring back some of the soldier in these times\nWhat most people see at the theater and I I have yet to see it so tell us what happens\nIs essentially just live episode we um you know we have we have like a video stray with a real projector where we actually go back and do our own silhouettes in behind the street at a rough on them these terrible movies\nThat were the do it on this tour of the brain um and it but we also do the sketches where the jumps to so we do like in bed sharing so those crops their songs\nThey also do the sketches that word the jumpsuits than we do like invention exchange of those crops their songs and it's a it's just like say the episode happened in front of you but we can't edit out our mistakes so there's always that live comedy element of uh anything can kinda go wrong and messed up but that's kind of a the fun of it\nRight in and to work with Joel and Joel is a guy that you're going back to the days before mystery science theater when he showed up on Saturday Night live with with some great comedy there was always so inventive so experimental\nTalk a little bit about the working your own comedy your own brand new comedy into the mind them increase in July ...\nYeah I mean you know it's uh I I've been a fan of his two for somebody like as I used to have tapes of his Letterman appearances right in the day as well and and you know to say that the show itself kind of uh influence\nMy sense of humor a along with shows around that same time like mister show with Bob and David and kids in the hall and you know it's been something like that um it it my my sense of humor has kind of already a being a unintentionally train\nTo kind of a leading me towards this is\nA real rural or I have to kind of be stark yet movies and I'm a I I I Can't really say to like what I what I did sort of like bring my own voice into it I think that kind of happens naturally um but uh it's what I what I tried to do is not hire\nThey might give you some being involved in this kind of use that as my character of just being happy to be they're happy to be involved\nJoni you were born in Hawaii and you were once in a punk Sandy\nYeah I was born and raised ... who grew up in the town of Kailua at a um yeah my dad has been there for generations and uh we uh ... yeah I just like that's how I you know kill time growing up and say I play the drums that a lot of punk rock and the hardcore punk bands and\nYou know we made a ... records and you know a little ... beans and stuff like that and we even went on tour I stopped playing it bans\nA what I was about Eighteen or Nineteen and that's when I moved to Los Angeles to become a comic and what's funny is that just like now that I have a little bit more time than my wife uh I got out I started another punk band\nWith a couple of course you did in resent brings up another point of curiosity because a lot of the incidental music did was use on nuts lakes in mystery science\nWas a new versions of songs that were done on the old series um being from the comedy central days the Kansas song and things like that made an appearance were you involved musically in any of that\nAre not so much what we did actually as we reached out to a friend of mine who goes by the name of harm our superstar he's the one that said the new theme song\nHe's an incredible singer and songwriter musician out of Minneapolis and I've known for years she was actually hit a has bad it was a my wedding band at my in my wife's\nWedding a night and so\nAnd he's like he used to it all over he's opened up for you know like a stroke center has opened up for a huge like he's just a really amazing say or a it was just like a tour as Sam Cooke like he didn't like it but to Sam Cooke sounds so is this really great guy and so he got together a bunch of musicians\nHum and then kind of ... re did those songs and that's kind of cool too because of the idea of um it's like he's from Minneapolis shows from Minneapolis so don't cut ties together\nJohnny you said you moved to LA in Eighteen to become a comic when did you sense of humor funny\nUm I still haven't figured that out it or not yet a fear that you are\nTo uh you know I was always the funny kid I was a big uh you know it was a pretty large kid growing up and um you know and I uh I I was also really wiped out and it was like\nYou know growing up in Hawaii as like a white kid and the big big big kid and you know uh yeah I got picked on a lot so I think I just kind of came out of necessity or like a lot of people and just uh\nBeing funny to try and not get beat up because you're you know I'm I was really tall right away so it's just like to kind of a you know subvert any unwanted attention I have to create my own attach it by being money\nHere you generate is here with us and against ... where you will see the mystery science theater three thousand lines show October thirtieth night before Halloween you can go get a little spooky to some really bad movies and watch them great comedy gone on stage and one of the things that I noticed first about the movies the guys pick for Netflix\nWas different from the original series I\nGrew up on creature feature in the Saturday afternoon the whole black and white terrible movies and uh obviously somebody jewel went all the movies that were done for Netflix only in color was conscious thing or did it just kind of work out that way that that is what you found\n... I Believe ... ... decision about that was that you know they were just when they first started doing the show they were just getting whatever you know ... they could get to make a show\nOr now that we kind of had a little bit of a time and a little bit of money to\nLook out we wanted the shuttle look good at and we want it to be able to reach out to these uh distributors and get good prince a of these old movies and\nBecause we're going to be an HD for the first time and it's on Netflix and people have these nice big TV's Joel wanting to watch the show to just kind of look good and ah and like have a not be so you know the movies are already bad enough\nOr you don't want to also have that'd be kind of hard on the eyes\nI hear you I mean what about the movies reaching you tip the hand a little bit about what we're going to see on the thirtieth in terms of the movies you'll be risky\nWe are not allowed to reveal any of that I think is going to say they're gonna start licking\nThem soon or ... or there's a there's I Know I could I Know I can tell you that there is a movie that is a it's it's a lot more current ... going to be like the newest movie I'm the most recent movie that we've ever done or the shows that were done really\nExcellent Joni you'll be in St Louis on his ... you know when you're on the road and when you come here do you get any free time he'll enjoy city you're in working in\n... you know it's I'm I'm like I said before I'm like I'm six five and it's a sip it on a bus overnight has not been nice comfortable slave so like yeah you know you're kind of in this house sleep safe\nAnd then once the bus lands in the city in the morning that's when you fall asleep you wake up like it all around eleven or twelve a you know and then you just try and see if we can find some food and then all of a sudden it's time for tech rehearsal and meet and greet you got to be fans then you've got to get ready for the show so rare that we ever get a chance to see anything\nFrom Joan how how's your wife\nMy wife is about a foot shorter than [laughter] a lot of average type show I'm the I'm the freaking the situation in\nJune and raised here with us from history

you knew you'd be a part of it a ... easy it's hard to narrow down from ten years' worth of episodes but do you have a favorite\nIt's hard to narrow down from ten years' worth of episodes but do you have a favorite\nYeah uh you know it's funny it's a if if I ever episode of the movie they put out um for when they did this I Wonder ... basically the opposite for the theater and I had just happened to be visiting my uncle Reno nevada and like I was like hey this is playing this probably won't play why\nWhy so\nI think of the faith and we went and saw it and it's just it's like you know when it came out it was a special treat because it was a stole thing I did it on the mainland and they all go to and so I better VHS\nAs it is I think one of the best read that so that if I were to pick a an

will indeed you know speaking of ah things regarding politics and the the general state of affairs it was a fascinating article that showed up in the post dispatch this morning about our heavily contested Senate race between Claire McCaskill and Josh Hawley\nAnd they were talking not specifically about the race itself because as everybody knows is razor thin the margins between the two um all of the pollsters are going nuts right now trying to figure out who's in the lead image thing and it's almost impossible to get a gauge\nAs to who's going to win but I I guess that's why you'll be tuning into here's the day after election day to find out all the the latest on the ah\nThat you know of course a lot of coverage into the night as well the latest on the returns as they continue to come in but if past precedent in the state of Missouri it's going to be in the morning hours before they get this one sorted\nAnd you were on vacation last week during the debate yep it was really interesting yeah but ah you\nWhen it comes to the money the the big money donors in this thing are some of the usual suspects and I'm sure there's a bunch of names that were not that familiar with and when I started thinking about when I was reading all of this is that I have never given money to a political campaign\nIn my adult life I've never send a check to anybody running a political campaign\nI I mean you know my my I guess my donation to any given political candidate is my vote you know they don't need by while they do that they'll tell you they need my money but I needed more than they do and and so I just always drinking you know what I'll either vote for you or I won't but I'm not I'm not going to get involved monetary early\nIn the news business could you would want to do\nWell I never did because I was in the news business and we couldn't have political science and our yard right right and I had a I worked with on a reporter who did not vote\nOh simply might've landed you might remember from years ago Chris ... who is a channel five reporter right sure he did not vote he made a decision not to so he could remain nonpartisan his reporting so that he didn't have a dog is editors dies his right to vote it's it's an interesting choice and I guess even if you're in the news business\nHow would how would anybody know\nWhen I guess they could look it up that you led contributing to a political campaign oh yeah that's all public record I Would think as a as a rule because of ethical concerns people would not do that\nI didn't know if you've maybe some of the bigger news organizations had rules against it um you know if they would preclude you if you were an on air reporter or even a a reporter who just wrote a some of the stories for other people to read it if they would keep you from donating money to a political campaign maybe\nThat comes down to the contract to have we could not endorse anything just right now I Can't endorse products 'cause I'm not in the news business but we're not allowed to endorse anything nor accept anything with it value more than twenty five dollar right\nAnd as somebody might find out a because it's public record if you've donated by two political campaign that would effectively be in a ...\nIt would be so I Do and I would guess I mean it never occurred to me just because I didn't you know came under the heading of endorsement I'm just cheap\nPlus it's funny this probably isn't true for some reason\nI think when people contribute money to a political campaign they must have a lot of money right but it's probably like giving to a nonprofit even five dollars help\nRight and that's what I mean Bernie Sanders when he was running for president twenty sixteen I had that twenty seven dollar figure that the average donation to his campaign and the first portion of it was twenty seven dollars show people made a point of donating in twenty seven dollar increment\nThe St Louis damn McLaughlin here big

in this case he was choice to be and it was something that in addition to being totally bizarre was also an awful lot of fun\nI've told this story before about how when I was a kid at our school did not have air conditioning so if there was a hot day at the beginning or the end of the school year they would often just open all the doors and all the doors to the classrooms and the windows and everything else\nAnd just run the school day like that and every so often Buffalo New York yeah and every so often a stray dog\nWould run into the school and then go just go from classroom to classroom and you could hear it even if you didn't know what was going on if it was it the other end of the whole way you'd hear one of the classrooms down there go nuts\nWe all these little elementary school kids and\nAnd it would go from class to class as this dog ran through and uh and it was ...\nWould go from class to class as this dog ran through\nAnd uh and it was always fun it was one of those strange little things that broke up the day will a similar thing happened in North county yesterday only instead of dogs in Spanish lake it was horses\nSchool well on school grounds anyway ah they didn't quite make it into the school because of the school went on lockdown what happened was what had happened was there was a a civil war reenactment going on now\nAnd a couple of the horses are they were gearing up for one a couple of the horses saw an opportunity to make a break for it and said hey that nice thick green grass over there on that schoolyard looks brings me so they they just clapped over to the school it's a little more elementary a playground and\nThey just started standing there eating some grass in\nLos ...\nSort of wild horses came\nUp and they were either as outside the school yard and and the school went on lockdown and I can't imagine what the kids inside that school must have been thinking as they were all cause I can see them in my head plastered against the window with hands and noses you know last night yeah what else could you do if you're a teacher\nAnd there's horses outside on the playground and you have lost control of a classroom and that would be kinda cool [laughter] the most one thing I get a ... and the great thing about this again is it yes it's made national news we look a little goofy but uh hey there's nothing wrong with that is going to put smiles on an awful lot of faces\nAnd if you want a good vacation spot where you can see horses and the beach in a different way stops acetate dialing\nThere you go or you know you can go to rocky point ride them yourself a we also have a story and this one's a strange one\nOut of Los Angeles and I don't know if you've seen the video on this yet there was a World War two vintage aircraft that crashed on the one on one freeway no I didn't have it good news or you get on this one is nobody got hurt an outline 'til oh no ... nobody got hurt and not even the the pilot of the airplane he's fine he got out although\nUh in the crash the plane did eventually burst into flames he's always hires all get out of the way up and there were cars he was the middle of the day on the one on the freeway\nRight I think it was a little west of downtown LA and uh and this thing landed now the curious thing about it if you know a great deal about World War two aircraft\nThe usually if you see a lick the the the ads in the newspaper that say you can come and fly in a real world war two air you know a word not really what they take you up in generally is a trainer aircraft called the tea six Texan\nAnd that's what this was but it was a group that I guess did the same kind of reenacting the civil war reenactors do but they do dogs sites\nAnd so they have to have good guys and bad guys will they had this even though it was an American plane the tea six uh they had it painted up in German literary ... got it didn't I didn't see a swastika on it but it had like the the cross on the wings and all of that\nAnd it was weird to see one of our planes painted up like one of ... but still a seeing this thing land on the one on the freeway and and how he got\nEvery body out of the ... I don't know it just got lucky I guess in in he aimed for a blind spot how in the in the traffic and just landed the thing on the freeway the good thing about the tea six because it was built to be a trainer is it's an extremely easy plane to fly\nAnd you can glide them into a landing fairly easily unless you're my grandfather who crashed one it's got field but that's another story for another you know uh and that's part of the reasons why but\nYeah it it's a I I guess it was part of the reason why he was able to maneuver this thing to the ground without hurting anybody a least of all himself and got out of it could just walked away from it got out of the cockpit walk away and then the ... caught on fire so\nNo idea what a what it was the cause the crash and the first place what kind of mechanical failure it was but good for him for being able to glide this thing into a landing and not hurt anybody\nWill go to the phones and bring down into the mix if you want to jump in with his three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven or eight for one to six on the text line hello done", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "24"}
