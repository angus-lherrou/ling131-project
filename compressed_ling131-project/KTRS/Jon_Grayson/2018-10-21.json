I don't think there's ever been a better story teller the new Jim\nJay I'm going to get a copy of this broadcast on up out of the dumps for whatever reason I don't play those back just your car [laughter] so honored and I I really mean that from the bottom of my heart um I I still feel like I've got so much to prove that you and not have been around\nFor a long time and I never quite look back on my own or if it's happening like that I just try to do the right thing I feel I feel responsibility one we're on the air to do these subjects right a means of subjects being the people that were covering and the vet that were part of a [noise]\nI I ... I have a positive minded guy so I'm not a guy that's trying to dig up dirt than trying to to be coming from an ape\nIs a sense of negativity or sarcasm or or or anything that covers an event and such

tremendous amount of responsibility though and off the on Sunday\nThe winner of the plot of acre trophy on Sunday I it's going to be sold for it and be that I Am able to reflect what that person feels at that time how hard they work to take that step moment that stage\nUh how they said how the guy who were the people that out of hand it's a tricky thing trying to drop\nIn these stories on when you do it because most of the time to just not the space that window\nThat to me it's not like the show where we can carry on the conversation things are moving really quickly and your rapidly switching gears and had to get off of this purse or reading a ... or you know sending the action out the sixteen or Eighteen or you know maybe has it for for ten seconds in fact the Fifteen and again\nBut um

I I\nGet it you know this this deep sense you know the the the lines zoo that reputation seems to have said but you know they get some pressure yesterday and do you get a sense\nThat this is that this group is maybe closer to being able to get consistent pressure with their front for do you maybe want to see some more blitz seen some more pressure and and how keys that going to be down the stretch Howard as they face the rest of this and she sees scheduled for this decent to create more happy\nAnd create more pressure on quarterbacks and an enforced turnovers maybe more than ...\nYou know it doesn't matter how you get into a weather rich with your your lunch or or if you're rushing five if you're using creative schemes to get it down they get pressure on the quarterback um if you got to do the ... she just got to make it happen in whatever way possible um\nWas just everything that you don't want to give way in the back or the middle of the video to a player who's facing the goal is attacking with with Claire running forum at was a\nThat that same out of the gate\nAnd then and then deal or you know Tony walls gets gets the red card you're playing short handed the rest of the way it at that point I think I think he gets the recording was still one zero but at that at that point you lose him\nAnd eventually obviously Orange County would put more goals in the board we're still down one nothing it had to feel like you know five or six nothing there and knowing that you you you were already without to your best players and now you're short handed the rest of the game\nAnd without Tony who's from edible yeah um so yeah that's a that's a tougher question and it seemed it seemed harsh to the eye when you're watching the game you don't know what was that you're not on the field so it's hard to hard to pass judgment on the on the card but uh you know to to get a street read\n'em for saying something like I don't know it was for a file for saying something that was a that was pretty harsh so yeah go going down down a goal down a player in that you're playing with ten and down Tony ... fall and count Greg\n[laughter] that's a tall order against Orange County\nJail Shelly with us St Louis s e falling in the U. S. L. playoffs last night to Orange County on the road my score of four to nothing detail as we look back on this year there's there is a lot to feel good about though is in there\nSure I mean our first a first playoff experience\nUm you know I think Anthony and the staff that are really good job of of getting through some of the tough times and the dog days of June and July I think we were nine three and three during the regular season and the second half of the season that's a that's a great record and you know Anthony Kennedy said all along\nThe second half a season level on our way into the playoffs and they hit it right and a half but there's a lot to build them\nA lot to build on it it is you know in in in you know after the game said it it's it's a bit it's his goal to get this thing to ah to that next level ... what what is required to get the team\nTo that next point Dale other again other they said uh hopefully you're you're healthy or the next time around because of course\nThe this kid in the middle of the year almost do are entirely to the injuries and again you can ... you know you lose your tops you know two players possibly to injury things were going to go different so I ... is there anything to pinpoint to say what what the next step is and how you get to that next step for this he I I\nI think I think we have to look at um where where ... where we need some death you know we we were lucky lucky to have\nFor a very good front players um when you now look at what happened last night and you go yeah we're all short and to play out Colbert send in the center of the park who's a who's a left back right now I Know he's played in in the center of the park for a college or what not but\nUm you know we've had some shuffling around at the right back spot one Barton went down a weren't trying to figure out who is going to play as a as a write back\nSo maybe a little bit more balance in a team trying to find you know that guy that can play maybe two to defend their positions like an outside back in the Senate back roll a in a pinch getting a little more depth and the sound of the park\nI think we had plenty of duck wide plenty adept up front and maybe that means that we had too much they're only needed spent so much someplace else um but it is what it is we had\nOnly had four good Trump players we certainly needed um when when Cory went down and and ah Michael hops on yet and count was the only one carrying the load 'em so we need it for it at different stages during the course but we also got well short at some other places\nWell damn we did see an upset in the first round as a swab knocked off Sacramento so it's open Phoenix in one semi final in the west it's Reno and oh see in the other how do you see the the the west play not from here\nYeah it's interesting I you know will you and I would call the Reno game yet I'm over monarchs we got swept him wrong\nUm so I Would say first off Reno and see I still you know I I still like Reno a a dark horse and I like like the way they've come around here as of late but\nHow do you argue against those see right now it's I Know how to stay where they were because of playing a man up or Seventy minutes or so\nBut ah they still look they still look good and look like they're on a roll Phoenix who's going to be awful tough for ... deal with that politically so to me it looks like it's going to be in orange county and Phoenix a conference final\nDeal silly it serves been a pleasure all season long catching up on these Sundays and obviously on M.
