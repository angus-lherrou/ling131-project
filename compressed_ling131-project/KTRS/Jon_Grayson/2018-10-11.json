always good to be home sharks huh\nNow that it is the need for this book was done back in Nineteen fifty five when your dad was a car executives\nMe right right here in St Louis we lived in the hills and he pulled into the driveway one night in a pink Nineteen fifty five\nTo ... and all the kids we were standing out in front of the house and all the kids ran away from the ice cream truck and random my dad's car and that was it that was it I remember that like it was yesterday and at at the cars sees me at that moment and then stayed with me ever since\nYeah and if the names behind the cars it's funny because some of the executives names we know it'd be Henry Ford it ordinary junior and all of that\nBut when it comes to the design guys you have to be really geeky about cars to get to these and and you and I both have that in common so the the this book centers around a guy by the name of hardly rural cry for folks who have never heard his name before who was he well Harley was\nThe guy he he became famous you know ... and his era as the guy who he was the father of the Corvette and he was the guy who put fins on cars in the fifties and that's how he became well known it became somewhat of a household name back then\nBut he was a whole lot more than that he was he was basically I argue that he was the Steve Jobs of his time um he was the guy he he changed the car business by basically asking the question okay we know all\nCars work but what is an American car what's what she didn't look like and what she did it in body and back at that time nobody was asking that question they were they were making a car you know that the basically a\nFord invented by by by deserve coming up with the uh the the ... moving assembly line that was a\nCompletely utilitarian he was a vehicle for moving people from one in their store from one point to another as efficiently as as possible and in a vehicle that pardon the expression didn't poop\nWasn't a horse because that was a big environmental problem in the country in the early Nineteen hundreds was what horses were dropping on the on the streets in in all the big cities Fifteen million pounds a year had moved from the street and you're done now the year I day in New York\nSo whoever won the contest to produce to invent that vehicle first one was going to make a lot of money and that was and report but his idea didn't go beyond backed right he didn't see he wanted to make that same car for Fifteen Years and he did\nA and a penny two thirds the cars on the road we're forwards because of that um but hardly changed it\nYou know highly was really an artist ended I already made cars beautiful\nOh yeah he he was the one who it was weird or circumstance that produced him in the sense that his father was a carriage maker in in California and they moved into this little dirt street village up in the hills above Los Angeles Hollywood justice will be the meal and at the University of moved to the John with cameras so his father very quickly was producing\nRoman chariots and and and you know Chuck wagon ... stage coaches for the movie oh that's great and and you know in this little dirt dirt street tend to nobody knew of and that was just a happenstance oh hardly grew up watching movies\nAnd and basically we early car bodies being made he got to know excessively ... who took him under his wing and hardly was kind of flamboyant by nature\nAnd he admires sesame ... he came to view of the car business is kind of another form of show business and he started making car bodies for\nBudding you know silent film stars this young group of people twenty three years old that became really really fame pain like no one has ever known before and had money like no one ever seen before and they wanted a car one one of the Concord hardly did that\nBack in Detroit and GM is trying to figure out how to compete with Ford and there's no way to do it financially you cannot out you can I produced him therefore you can't you can't compete on price so they said well maybe if we made our cars look better and made them change more often how do we do that\nThey heard about this wonder tuned out in California and they hired him and they brought him you know and said okay here's what we need to do\nCan you do it and he needed to invent a system of a desire styling staff that they can change their five looks to bear five divisions were cars more often you know hopefully every year without\nCosting hundreds of millions of dollars every year to shut down their their factories and retool yeah and that's that was his genius really\nAnd you mentioned the fins obviously that's the name of the book as well but once the ... the were the Buick port holds him was that his idea was all under him out\nHere that is if you're the head guy back down all credit goes to you because nothing went on the car that Harley didn't go yeah uh-huh and nothing ever got on there to eat in a proof\nBut the other thing that always telling me about him and we were talking off the air I'm I like the verge election that decides the Chrysler stuff and hardly year old student or a close second I mean they're like a and a and a one on one\nChrysler and stuff and hardly ... or a close second I mean they're like a and a and a one on one a but uh the other thing is working on cars during the seventies and eighties\nI Would constantly complain about you know to the design guys even talk to the engineers at all ever but that's hardly Earl seem to have an understanding of the engineering of the vehicles as well because the designs made sense for something that needed to move down the road and that you might need to fix but\nThe way that happened was when he first went into Jim Jim was an engineering culture and those engineers who were basically former\nMechanics yeah you know they design those guys they do the pictures ... here it is as in Harley\nYou know he put the cart before the horse he ... he came up with how it look first\nAnd then because he had support from the top guy said here's what we want to look like engineer to this and make it work and they hated him he's still the power away and he was he dressed flamboyantly in war\nYou know paint socks and more Hollywood ... see no and they hated him and he eventually won them over because he\nCould pick the cars in the car started selling and what he did was he\nRealized that the whatever Henry Ford was doing he wasn't\nAppealing to people's aspirations and their sense of beauty and what they might want you know as opposed to here's your transportation take it or leave us black okay that's good that's the cheapest fastest ... you know you're gonna ... Harley point do their thing and everybody had a car but\nI really want something that says something about me and he really got into that and he had a sense of what it because he knew that one of the middle America what they liked what movie stars live like that flamboyant they like that and they all want a little piece of that\nAnd and that's and that's what made the car industry explode inside that satisfying that desire where people ... you know started replace their cars every five years then every three years and then he eventually got down to you know you the people who can afford it would every year more often sets that was it\nWhy this is the home of the Missouri tiger [noise] those big fires\nAre as St Louis on the news\nGot over search and rescue efforts are now underway and Florida day after hurricane Michael slammed into that states panhandle governor Rick Scott will be checking out the damage in Panama City beach and Mexico beach where the storm made landfall I Know what I'm going to see today is way worse than I Would ever have\nImagined in North Carolina may have been spared much of the devastation this time of governor Roy Cooper says this state is still dealing with hardships that month after Hurricane Florence has\nMuch of the state is earned or flash flood warnings for watches the state is under a tornado watch many locations in the mountains and foot hills are reporting trees down and water covering road cycle\nIs now a tropical storm there are tornado watches from North Carolina Virginia until nine o'clock tonight part of the criminal case against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been drops\nHarvey Weinstein looked on in court as the Manhattan District attorney's office drop the sexual assault charge based on an allegation from Lucia Evans\nWe are pleased with this development cases not over but I think it is permanently hand irreparably damaged defense\nAttorney Ben Brafman said he would have tried to dismiss all charges Evans accused Weinstein of forcing her to perform oral sex but prosecutors discovered an account that suggests their encounter could have been consensual prosecutor said nothing related to dismiss charge impacts the strength of the remaining case Aaron ...

Virginia Woolf oh yeah with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Barrett now that's a scary movie\nIndeed a and Richard Burton was pretty scary so just in general but if you wanted with us on the wheel of topics three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven there are a few new stories to get your updated on\nBecause uh charges have been filed in that limousine crash in New York I heard against his son yes I Do now right because the owner himself I guess lives in Pakistan and he was he had his son run the business for him ah from New York and show that that some of his album\nYou had his son run the business for him ah from New York and so that the sun has been charged negligent homicide right right which means that they um I I I guess there's a couple of different ways you could look at what is behind that charge\nA because again we don't know very much about what the investigation is already uncovered but will we do know is that the limousine driver was not license to drive that vehicle\nAnd that vehicle had failed and inspection showed in either of them should have been on the road and yet both of them worry and it is it and obviously now deadly situation so they it could be as simple as that whether this was the first charge to come out because what we already know points to criminal activity\nOr are there could be more to the fact that that uh cars we were talking about the other day failed that inspection we don't know what failed\nRight as a family of the drivers claiming he had a chauffeur's license right die charge has pleaded not guilty\nAnd very yeah it was so ... there's there's plenty coming up on this but uh the state of New York is in fact looking at this as a criminal act not just an accident and they will you be following this and see if any additional charges were filed it would not surprise me to see a raft of charges come out of this and this is only the first one\nAnd I heard on the news they're starting to hold memorials today yeah for the twenty people that were killed right\nAnd and if there's another story that a boy I tell you if you're looking for something to really amaze you at a on the other side of the news on the upside at how far we have come\nThere was a and one could have been a terrible accident this morning\nBecause a pair of astronauts one Russian and one American War on their way to the international space station which by the way we're going to get a flyby tonight tell you about that and I'm In a really nice one by the way show with these two were on their way to the I. S. S. and in a Soyuz rocket and it malfunctioned\nSo it was on his way up and they were in it and the thing just had some kind of terrible malfunction they could not recover from and how is this for terrify\nSo you're in this giant explosion propelling you into space not only does something go wrong but then the craft what's left of the craft of urine begins what they call a ballistic descent\nWhich means that the only thing the only force acting on it at that point is gravity\nSo they're uh they're just falling in free fall back to earth so they had to separate the capsule from what was left of the rocket this malfunctioning rocket behind them\nAnd they did that and that went well and then they had to deploy parachutes and that was all they kept them alive show these parachutes slowed the dissent enough\nThat when the craft came to rest they just went and got them and they were apparently they were in perfect condition they weren't injured or anything it's amazing isn't it yeah imagine something like that happening in the early days of the space for I mean we have the Apollo one accident the fire and that was enough to set everything back months\nAnd yet we recovered from it eventually but did you ever think we would get to the point where a space accident would end up with a couple of guys going who it was scary yeah [laughter] and yet here we are\nSo good news coming out of that one in what ... you know everybody was just terrified over and that is for some reason that phrase ballistic dissent just stuck in my mind and I thought that's one thing I never want to be in\nNo it sounds like sounds hopeless right\nIt sounds like you're in a bullet headed back toward the ground which affective leaves well what they were uh and and the other weird one is one that again is catastrophe narrowly averted there's a guy who was arrested a\nAnd he was he is he lives in the state of New York his name is Paul Rosenfeld these fifty six years old and the federal authorities arrested this guy they said that he was planning on committing suicide on election day have you heard about this\nI I Am looking at it\nYeah uh what this is the man had done\nIs he a constructive two hundred pound bomb and he was going to take it to the national mall in Washington DC and blow himself sky high along with whatever else she could destroy now here's the crazy part about well as if that's a weird enough right but here's the added a bit of this story that again is catastrophe narrowly averted", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "11"}
