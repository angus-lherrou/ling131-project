unfortunately are tied to a by way of ... on the line by the government in Pittsburgh to that story over the weekend and uh as we're always looking for the positive end of things you're on the big five fifty or we decided to look a little bit more into this organization and the good work that they've been doing\nFor more than a hundred years now and ... he's the director of communications for highest and bill welcome to the program\nNow in ... she's the director of communications for the highest do welcome to the program\nJohn Hi Jennifer\nChang to joining us now can you tell our listeners about highest in the kind of work you do\nSure to mention was originally for him to in the Eighteen eighties Hebrew immigrant aid society is the oldest refugee protection organization in the world um we were started here in New York um to help\nJewish refugees who were playing the programs in Russia\nAnd in those days we literally met them at the docks\nAt Ellis Island and help them take their first steps ashore in America and help them find places to live and job to get their kids in school\nUm fast forward to today and we use the same work but we don't exclusively held Jewish refugees now part of the U.S refugee admissions program which is administered by the state department where one of nine agencies who do this work\nAnd while we're still a Jewish organization we say now that we used to help refugees because they were Jewish and today we help refugees because we are Jewish so\nWe do the same work that we've always thought we meet people at the airport we help them get their kids in school and get a job and get going and the U.S in the usa refugees are given a rather short window to to start working and paying taxes and becoming part of our society and that's what we help them do\nNo doubt in and of course we're in the St Louis area have seen a number of incidents over the years where we settled refugee populations into our population most recently the Bosnia community which is a burgeoning part of our area so should talk about how something whether reached the conflict in door for one of the Bosnian situation were or\nRefugees from all over the world how they end up on the highest his radar\nSure you know a lot of people don't even know what a refugee isn't and it's a legal definition under international law you don't just say you're ... you have to cross in international border first of all fleeing persecution so if you simply move from one part of your country to another because of a civil war there\nTechnically not a refugee you're a good place to person and we don't work with them as much but once you cross the border you can then asked for refugee status which would have to get from the United nations\nAnd in the United nations here's your case and your claim that you say here's why I'm a refugee and they agree they can give you a refugee status\nFor you know out of the sixty eight million people in the world right now who are refugees and internally displaced people um that number according to the un a tiny tiny fraction maybe one percent will ever be eligible and be resettled\nLaw live their lives in refugee camps or they just find a place to live in a city somewhere um but there is a tiny group\nWho kind of make it to the head of the line and the un will say we think you're a good candidate for resettlement and that could be because\nYou're a woman single head of household with children and nobody to protect them or you're a particularly vulnerable because you've been tortured or I'm\nA medical assistance that he can only get in a western country or or maybe you're I'm a gay person in a society where even in a refugee camps are not safe so the un to expose people and then they may refer them to the United states or to another country that does refugee resettlement we're not the only ones who do it\nIn those referrals go to the state department and the state department decides who we bring in and they've asked them very carefully refugees are most affected people or anybody who gets into this country and they don't get in until they're\nShirley thoroughly vetted and by the way the record on that is standing\nSo then the state department assigned their case to one of these night agencies and if we get the case\nWe've and decide where in our network and we have twenty sites across the country including Pittsburgh where we would refer to them and in most cases the local agency on the ground if something like a Jewish family services agency\nAnd they are the ones who are doing the the the real um the amazing work\nMeeting them at the airport helping them find their home getting their kids in school showing them I mean imagine some of these people have never been to a society like ours and they have never been to a [noise] a Wal Mart or a Costco and so we showed them how to shop and he showed them how to use credit cards\nBut these people are incredibly resilient they pick it up very quickly and I'll tell you they they want to become part of the society and they do most in most cases some people have difficulty we have to admit that but the majority do very well\nUm and there's also a role for volunteers in most communities synagogues churches community groups do things like\nUm you know gathering donated furniture and clothing and I'm helping drive people to doctors appointments and mentoring them a teaching English so it's a partnership in most cases between the resettlement agency and the local community and it's it's a wonderful thing to say\nWell and damaged in our experience here in St Louis with the international Institute refugees are welcome Dan become part of the community\n[noise] well that's true and I'll tell you the the refugee admissions program that I spoke of ... started in Nineteen eighty some\nBefore that we did take refugees but it was done and I'm In southern more ad hoc manner and in Nineteen eighty [noise] um I'm just at the moment when at the end of the Carter administration the beginning of the Reagan Administration\nCongress you I Believe it was unanimous no because certainly with a lot of bipartisan support said\nThis is the kind of think America should do it and we should have a process for doing it um and so it's it's always been until very very recently this was something that everybody said of course this is what we do this is America we we take these people and we help them\nAnd I'm at and we help them get their life started it's not just a handout program\nUm unfortunately in the last few years um there's been people who've raised suspicions\nAnd there's a lot of fear going on and a lot of people are afraid and then and and so this has become distorted\nUm [noise] I Know from my personal experience it sounds like you guys in St Louis have had a lot of experience that the refugees who come here\nAnd they want nothing more than to just get their lives back on track right and the communities that welcome them I'm really give them that that they're holding their hand through the early stages and then they go on to become become as American as anybody else just like our ancestors did\nYou can

Illinois and but I grew up near St Louis about forty five minutes east so I thought I'd try this market for a while and luckily I found myself in a church basement\nAnd Peggy tell us a little bit about your role I Know you've done TV and theater work on both coasts what about in this church basement lady\nIn church basement ladies I Am Vivian ... doesn't want anything to change no no no no no no no I'm so she is the um [noise]\nThe tactile head of the basement of the church of the kitchen so everything that she knows and does she expects these ladies to follow suit\nI she comes across as very cranky at times very just will not even give an inch\nBut underneath all of that there is this very sort of warm hearted a woman who does the ... things are changing and eventually it comes to the point where she goes okay I have to let go as much as I don't want to\nAnd I'm not happy about this I Know that it needs to happen and so that's kind of her character\nYou you're one of your TV\nTo happen and so that's kind of her character\nNow that you want to your TV credits Jennifer mentioned a little while ago you were on third rock\nI was like I'm the first season of third rock you would not recognize it was an episode Carl\nThe art of Dick where they are taking art classes\nYou can say are on the radio\n[laughter] and\nUm yeah and I just I play one of the little ladies that doing basically the PTA a cookie drives\nAnd she has to be nine in this awful blonde away I get and um I had you know like a couple of lines but and I was not blonde at the time\nThat I was cast him when I went the guy looked at me the director and he went I told him she's not a blonde and then I said well no I'm not going to go read the script the script is changed you'll find out\nAnd that's when they put me in this really bad Partridge Family sort of blonde wig I find that episode it's out there\nWere also in the ... and the beautiful I yes I was ... on the Bolden the beautiful for a couple of years and my daughter's baby\nWas stolen from us after he was born because he was the child up the side of the family and they had a little earth mark and so there was a whole\nYou know Mitch gossip about I'm trying to find the baby and get him back\nTo us and then we disappeared and we never came back [laughter] an actor\nWhat's your day to day schedule like for that compared to being in the theater production like church ... it is\nVery very different because you go and in the morning you have like a table read where you go through the scenes for that day and then you break for lunch and you go on then to\nCostume and to make up and then they take you out on the set and they still your scenes in sequence so you start with your first one then you just go all the way through\nSo it's not like being in a play where you know that it's going to be a certain\nStorytelling it's all chopped up mhm your film in your part of the story and that's it how long how many times have you forgotten your lines or something went wrong you had to add led the you know make do an audience would never even know how you would know\nLucky so\nFar my career not to have any big wasps but one of my favorite stories that I was part of it was in high school opening night of music man\nAnd our music man during a hundred and Seventy six trombone started just but that I can [laughter] man says up sorry folks we're gonna take it try number two and I remember feeling very helpless and Mary in the library and I was like\nI Can't it's just him or the plot will be real and so that's probably my biggest snafu that I've been through so far\nWe're going to tell you my favorite part of this morning this entire show so far has been listening to a woman who was playing a church basement believe correctly use the word ...\nGosh [laughter] ...
