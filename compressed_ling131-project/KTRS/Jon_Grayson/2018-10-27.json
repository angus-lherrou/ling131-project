T. R. S. store key T. R. S. were cell phones or one triple eight five fifty K. to Europe and we always have fun things to talk about that we've been yes we do\nAnd we just want to remind everybody that all of her clients are folks that are just like you ... over the age of fifty five those that would like to retire or we're currently retired and as Sarah mentioned we create a game plan for them so they hopefully have a fun enjoyable financially worry free\nRetirement and during the week if you'd like to contact with us or get with us there's a couple of ways you can do that right\nThat's right the first way is by logging on to our website a B L financial dot com there are a lot of excellent resource it on our website first of which is our monthly newsletter you can access that by clicking on the top\nTo above obviously what we're supposed to\nDo which kind of need is is that in this situation for them over one is they really weren't aware that there was a spousal benefits it would have been fifty percent more for the fifty percent but if it was more for Sally we saw her actual benefit increase for four hundred a month\nAnd that's pretty significant significant was about ... percent over after her benefit was able to grow so that was kind of for at the same time it also opens opportunities where they really got some new or different type of clean\nIn terms of time you were absolutely\nSo that was that was kind of thing and I knew the other thing that happened in their in their ... with us was with a toe Bob could hang around the water cooler right yes\nBob found out that\nEven though he has turned sixty five\nHe doesn't have to do anything at all because he's still working he thought he needed to elect his Medicare benefits for face the penalty\nBut the great news is because Bob works for a company that has more than twenty five employees\nAs Medicare benefits would have been secondary to his current coverage anyway so there's no need to\nElect your Medicare benefits until Bob decided to retire you don't have to inform Medicare or Social Security that they are not you're not taking your benefits because we can assure you that they know who you are and they are only interested in hearing from you when you were ready to elect your benefits\nI wouldn't want to do that on a timely basis do so as soon as Bob is ready to retire we'll see him again within sixty days and start the process of enrolling in Medicare part D by submitting the Medicare part B application and sending them back to his employer with a request for employer information\nBut that does is it tells Medicare that Bob was on their coverage from the day he turned sixty five until the day he decided to\nRetire and lost his benefits through work so that way the penalty will be waived against him and he'll be able to elect whatever type of policy he'd like to supplement his Medicare benefits\nInteresting situation and when we're done they're kind of blown away because we open their minds to several planning opportunities that they weren't really they weren't aware of and I would say I'm ... piece of advice\nTo consult your friends about Medicare oak shiver ... licensed agent right or ... or called Medicare directly because your friends don't do anything or a license and you know what happens when you get a licensed advice for people who are ... well\nI I read it and read a quote on line a couple of days ago when you pay peanuts you get monkeys\n[laughter] right so you have is when you don't pay anything nothing good I'm assuming but a\nExactly you want to get advice from not just someone that's license with someone that's willing to take responsibility for the answers that they give you\nSo I'm with that being said we actually have Patty on line one who has a question about spousal benefits will reduce the morning Patty [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] retirement age\n\nFor Patty unfortunately right now\nWhile you are under normal retirement ... under retirement age but I'm using disability you cannot elect you can't watch more than one benefit nor can you switch over to a spouse will benefit you'll have to wait until\nYou're at least sixty two years old in order to make that adjustment if your disability benefit is\nLess than fifty percent of your accent benefit minus thirty two percent which most likely that's not the case\nAt sixty two you could switch over what naturally happens with disability is you stay on disability until your normal retirement age and then you're automatically switch to your own benefit for your Social Security retirement benefits if it that particular point sixty percent of\nYour spouse or ex spouse his benefit is greater than your benefit they would allow you to make that switch because technically you're not actually using Social Security retirement you're using the Social Security disability pot so you have it made an actual Social Security election yet\nYou know who they are thinking there from a from a dollar point of view is the Social Security disability benefit is generally the same amount of these Social Security retirement benefit yes that I Would think that ... probably\nTrudy normal retirement benefit yes that I Would think that Patty probably\nI mean even if she could which you can but she's really probably the best way she is today which is getting her ...\nAbsolutely require equivalent to with that is right\nIt just opens up the door and the future is Patti bad as it happened to ... percent of her ex spouse his benefit happened to be less than what her full benefit is they would still allow her to make that change it full retirement age but right now you're definitely in the best available Patty\n\n[noise]\n\nWon't be here all our\nRetirement\nSell your Social Security benefit is based on the top thirty five earning quarters that you've had\nShow and right now you're earning more than you have in the past then your Social Security benefit will adjust up word incrementally based on that if you're not then those numbers are just going to fall to the bottom and most likely or Social Security benefit will not change except for\nThe cost of living adjustments that he'll probably received and at least you're eligible to receive annually if a president Congress approved them so like for example for twenty Nineteen\nYear to two point eight percent\nIncrease in Social Security benefit you all have access to that but if you're in your earnings are less than the top thirty five earnings that you've had and most likely that's not going to impact or benefit\nWhich grade were\nAbsolutely for a couple of a mind bender or is this morning right good questions\nWe like that it was sort of like a sort of like a mini work out really good question and again these are ones that we see all the time during a coaching sessions wishes for being able to get that um you know be able to get the information they seek is a cool thing to do it as their mission before there's a couple of ways you can do that\nObviously coming to visit with us we love to see it because we do see listeners every single week at the same time you can always go to our website submit a question and most likely it's going to show up on the show we like Angela yes we certainly like to in those in really all that becomes fodder for the show so we get our phone lines are open as you know\nPedal cars Betty just called but six nine Katie RS store Katie RS from your cell phones or one triple eight five fifty Katie Orr is\nWith the markets sliding\nWhat'd you do not freak out\nYou know that would be the first one right now we know the ... percent off his eyes from last month um will give it back or gains a we've also fall below the two hundred moody and moving average\nWhich is just what the what the index close what the has to be closed out over the course of the last two hundred days it's that that average number\n[noise] yes so what are some of the things that we think we believe you ought to consider does\nIn your thoughts are top it off which would stay calm right\nThat's right market corrections our normal we never market up into the right you know just a straight line up word that would be alarming I think to most um\nWe need to clear out speculators and make room for new highs and also new buying opportunities\nRight and this is actually the second corruption that we've seen a major one that we've seen ... percent so far this year we're the big move up in January obviously at the end of January beginning of February we should be you know came down and then we had the big move up all the way to the new highs in September and so it's a roller coaster so hang on right\nExactly in October is historically especially during the election year it's been a very volatile months because of that the market doesn't really like uncertainty and with heightened political\nDiscourse in the country right now I think it leads to increased volatility that not being the only point of all of 'em volatility but one of the major ones\nRight because the markets hum truly are based on the expectations of investors so I'm emotions run high and if they frankly I'm really drive this just thought it was just on the computer thing really is so that's really what drives things so what can you do well number one is\nAlways have cash available right\nWhat you want to have money set aside to meet your monthly income need as well as any short term capital needs that\nAs part of the policy and then the remaining balance of that they are going to pass onto you show in the\nEvent that you work for an employer that has less than twenty five employees you want to contact the insurance company directly to find out if you need to enroll in Medicare or not\nDo the I was going to add to that that um you know the ... the employer plan is going to basically changed the premiums if you're covered by Medicare or not it was a small employer baby and I know we've talked about it and we've looked at this for a smoke records it in ...\nYou know we've talked about it and we've looked at this for a smoke records it in many cases I'm all cases but in many cases it does make sense for the employer for the employees to jump off the employer ... that actually go directly to Medicare of our past employer coverage or to go right\nIf you're in the situation we have to like Medicare part B as well because that's going to add another hundred and thirty five dollars a month for 'em to your premium expense that most likely the employer is not going to subsidize for you\nSo if you are in that situation you might want to consider making a change but if you call the insurance company and they say part B is not required\nThen you're going to be in the same situation you have been since before you turn sixty five so you then you would still have the opportunity to wait on the\nAlso there is no penalties that are in full for you not like we talked about earlier there's no penalty for United ruling in Medicare pork sixty four because you're actively enrolled politically\nExactly there's two different competing things going on one is uh\nThe border and which Medicare pays and then the second would be a penalty or would it be a penalty assessed against you as long as you were enrolled in the employer based coverage even if your employer has less than twenty five employees\nWe hope that helps aspect Shirley Ree Smith is five and a five year old if they would\nWe wouldn't have [noise] we don't want to do and then we couldn't go to a point\nWell most insurers only or actually that's that's actually not that yeah that was my purpose perfectly accurate because\nMost insurers only required to employees that are not related by marriage to be to have a group health insurance policy there are eligibility requirements as well as participation requirements for the eligible participants there has to be Seventy five percent participation\nUnless you have coverage availability elsewhere Medicare would be considered a veil coverage elsewhere so you would still be able to maintain the group\nThat we have several small groups that are that are under five\nThough if so if um if you're playing the administration is getting that are you so it's like you could be the plan I mean the straighter\nYou wouldn't want to give her obstacle when we talk a little bit border of choice so thanks for the call that a\nGreat I'm All right and we have a sue on line to has a question about finding health insurance\nThere you go well not for me because I'm retired and I\nSense are you guys to a friend of mine he retired candidate and his wife and from work and insurance was going to be a thousand a month for coverage on him and his wife than retired\nNow like a month maybe a little over a month\nAnd it gets found out that is that there was a mistake his house and I'm I'm\nA little mistake All right\nPretty crazy yeah so now it's just a friend of mine and and I was\nWondering if you help someone or find insurance on\nPeople that aren't we [laughter] I I Do assist individuals that are retired but unfortunately um if you're under sixty five years old at least in twenty Eighteen the insurance companies in Missouri and some in Illinois no longer compensated brokers for\nA facilitating enrollment into individual policies so we kind of step back from that market my best ingestion is\nStill we do that but we but but we do do that for investment of ours requires me out\nOf course we assist for our investment advisory clients but for everyone else we've been referring to\nThe health insurance marketplace because for this until at least through the end of this year are you still are required to maintain health insurance and the health insurance options that meet the ... requirements are found on the market place so that health care doc Dobbs\nAfter December thirty first of this year there is no longer the individual mandate to have coverage but I did just signed out recently that the subsidies are going to continue into twenty at least until two into twenty Nineteen\nSo using the marketplace could work too I'm your friend advantage especially if they're no longer working that might have brought their income down which could help them find a policy that's going to be partially subsidized by the government\nOkay and where they needed a health care that exactly wow\nAbsolutely thank you very good that'd be great that obviously if they come in for coaching session was supposed to talk about\nTheir retirement plan you certainly can we can certainly talk about that time right of course actually who could qualify for loans are open today and it's great to get phone calls see what happens I or go so last week nobody calls me\nWell that can be expected\nFolks who goes we do have a couple of topics we'll get to a we have been heavily talking about health care is we should be because it's this is open to ruin Caesar or that we want to talk about the you're open enrollment rock stars of the week the missing with a sponsor very good for a\nCommon tree healthcare of Missouri\nIn the company that's right foot so let's talk about the job of selling Bob and Sally they came to visit this week a gift again they'd been in several times this week but for this specifically we were discussing health insurance\nAnd these folks are actually a bit of ours records for a couple of years as I Know that you've been speaking with him about health care for several years yes they were kind of resisting worker yes\nBecause they hit the initially ruled in Medicare before um before they became clients or they had arrangements and sometimes you got to work on folks right\nThat's right so Bob Bob he is Seventy years old and Sally is sixty nine [noise] ah they currently have United healthcare it with a plan ... supplement that they pay two hundred and forty dollars a month for per person they also have\nA ... let me start your though that's a traditional supplement ... pays zippy dude are when they go the doctor\nWretch right 'cause they get to pay two hundred and forty dollars a month to United healthcare they have the joy of that exactly their audit um prescription drug plans for twenty six dollars a month they are on a dental coverage for thirty six dollars a month they also purchased a vision policy for ten dollars a month\nTo buying stuff while they are\nI Believe Sally set it to me insurance poor\nWhich are they paying altogether them they're\nPaying three hundred and twelve dollars a month per person which is six hundred and twenty four dollars a month she had the couple which is Seventy five hundred dollars a year\nAnd that is does that doesn't include report the does\nNo I don't but also I don't include party because whatever we discuss sure they\nGo for it but just for listeners to understand that that's that is an including ... that you go that's\nCorrect and that's another you know a few thousand dollars\nIs it including for that to go that's correct and that's another you know a few thousand dollars a year worked for thirty four I reached sixteen hundred dollars a year ago thirty two rather\nSo the first thing that we did was discuss Bob and Sally medical care over the last year a Bob says he gets an ... allergy shot every week\nSally in pretty good health but she gets an injection once a month\nAnd they didn't take Medicare Advantage would be a good fit for them for a few reasons at which I've heard several over the last few years um they didn't think they'd have access to their physicians [noise] they didn't think that they'd receive the same benefits under traditional Medicare under Medicare Advantage as they do right now under traditional Medicare\nAnd they thought they'd end up paying more for the coverage under a Medicare Advantage plan than what they're paying now [noise]\nWhat's the true it was so exciting to tell them the incredible news that it's not [laughter] so you were so numbers give us a fever well basically before I sat down with Bob and Sally I requested\nThat they thought a medical questionnaire so we could get all of their physician and prescription that they are currently using so their maintenance physicians and their maintenance prescriptions so we could figure out what the best fit would be\nFor me it was cool here is that you're able to run those for your computer for\nExactly right so I can almost pinpoint\nFor example if you feel a certain prescription on a regular basis how much it will cost down to the dollar for you depending upon which pharmacy you select so we can really key into what your monthly an annual expenses are going to be regardless of what type of a supplement to Medicare that you choose [noise]\nSo that's just huge you know I mean you talk about peace of mind understand really what you're careful it could be assuming new books on the road um were ... piece of art for folks because we don't really clear for this on a ...\nAs far as the real feel for the actual number as I say there's

the stage of I Know that that for the most part these sorts of things relating to\nRetirement and planning for possible disability\nIs is a boring depending on where you sit so if you're probably in your forties or so you're thinking uh you know let let me change the channel and see what's happening in the sports world or what not but but if you sit in your seventies for example and we know that our audience by design is sixty plus\nBut if for example you're in your seventies then this has a relevance at an urgency that may not be appreciated when you're younger but here's the point\nThe necessity for something like this can be triggered in the ...\nYou're younger but here's the point the necessity for something like this can be triggered in the flash of and I mean just in a moment in time you can suddenly go from being competent to incompetent I don't think the average person realizes the magnitude of that problem when it happens\nWell I'll give you a real life example we came home when one afternoon and saw an ambulance imprint of one of our neighbors' homes and I thought oh dear he he maybe had a heart attack or something like that well it turns out he um had fallen down the stairs and is in his early sixties I Believe\nAnd gotta have really\nFailed diagnosis was diagnosed with a disease and it's incurable and it's going to alter his life drastically\nYeah and and things like that or sometimes a fall or an incident or trauma can can trigger something much bigger sometimes it's a short term emergency so whether it's an emergency that is is going to be resolved in\nIn days or weeks or months or something that will perhaps exist for the balance of your life in either case you need to know that that your laugh\nComes to a halt everything is on hold as a practical matter nobody can take care of the things that need to be taking care of your in your life because you're an adult I mean we we often forget that\nThe authority we have to take care of children which incidentally this is a proper analogy because children under the law considered incompetent they're incompetent to engage in transactions of various sorts automobiles\nAlcohol a guns I mean we we we limit their access to things that we think can cause problems with good reason we don't trust their judgment right with good reason some kids more than others but the point is when you're an adult the assumption is shifted but what happens when it's no longer true\nAnd and when that comes in unlock your child where you can take them to a doctor you can intervene to protect them and adult until a gamble goes down in a court\nAfter and unpleasant hearing and intrusive hearing typically in their doctors involved as there must be a there there is a a guardian ad litem typically appointed\nSo there are these these various people involved in a proceeding in a court house\nAnd this is costing money this is consuming time it may well everything's on hold until an order is issued but the fact is that the person who is needing this help is not in a position to have any say because by definition or incompetent so\nThat you want them to be able to move things around to qualify you for example\nFor a Medicaid planting medicate planning is among the more urgent things that might be triggered with this sort of emergency and and this is not a power this automatically given you you need to to give somebody expressly the authority to to transfer things interest\nOr to interact with a trustee et cetera with with your assets and and another thing that\nThat this Congress things relating to living wills et cetera and and we you know we know that that sometimes people will feel far more comfortable having people deal with just managing their stuff taking care of those fund the fundamentals than they do\nA tampering with something that might affect their estate planning okay so that that's a a a borderline there's some people don't want this person to cross and I get that and if you do want to give them authority to cross that line to do things that tie in with with quote unquote state plan then then you need to say at expressly\nBut among those prohibited powers the powers you cannot give them\nOur powers relating to a changing a will for example okay that's something that the law simply will not permit you to empower trust you to do maybe people listening say show I'm Glad to hear that\nBut but some people might want them to tamper with that plan or if if there are favorable tax laws or what not it's not unusual for there to be reasons but you should always just trust\nThat said that the the potential for someone with that sort of power or to maybe decide to rearrange things that are way that you wouldn't have approved\nThe once you're well is that why that can be done while you're confident but once you're declared incompetent there is not a lot of changing that can ... can happen\nWell right now ... and asked the wheel itself but now let's face it there's there's often now a lot of what's called non probate transfers and not provide transfers means that the law has come to recognize really in the last probably thirty forty years that\nThat people can pass things on\nA ... things that would normally have gone through the state without having to conform to all those very strict rules of what's called the statute of will statute of wills is very strict when people think oh you need\nTo witnesses they need to be what in the room to they need to see the signature you need to declare formally that before you put your your signature on a piece of paper to your witnesses out here by declaring us is by we'll all those formalities that are associated with will many people now try to bypass that\nWith things such as beneficiary clauses or or a payable on death provisions or transfer on death provisions there's a host of\nOr at least a number of alternatives that people have to this very traditional what\nThey regard as cumbersome and expensive [laughter] um\nIt's very traditional what\nThey regard as cumbersome and expensive [laughter] I'm a will process which of course by definition includes probate\nAnd and among those are people will will often um want to give a power of attorney somebody who has the power of attorney the authority to to handle some of these things to fix them in ways that that avoid probate\nAnd you can do some of those things okay but you've got to give them express authority but nothing that reaches into those things that do tie and directly with a will\nDirectly with a will those are things that you cannot give that authority it's forbidden under the statute\nWhen we're talking today about some of the top legal documents that you need to have and that you need to plan for that we've talked a little bit about durable power of attorney [noise] um we haven't gotten too much is a terrible power power of attorney for health care\nYeah I did I promise over to distinguish that uh that the durable power of attorney for health care thing of it this way\nWe just mentioned a will uh will is a declaration of the world that the this is what I Want to happen with my stuff right so it's not so much saying I hereby declare that bill\nIt will decide what happens to my stuff whatever bill says do\nOr that kind of what a durable power of attorney is and and that's what a durable power of attorney for health care is is it's giving discretion or authority to someone else to answer all those questions that doctors\nOr hospitals others involved in the in the health care field or they can simply turn to this person and whatever this person says they have authority and that's conclusive that's delegating power and that's where a durable power of attorney does in and specifically the power of attorney for health care\nA living will is different living wills where you are saying to the world that\nLook this is what I Want to happen if I'm In a condition where I'm incompetent and they're important decisions that have to be made about my health\nThese are the rules so it's not delegating it to anybody it's angry this document follow these rules it's really the opposite of a delegation of authority it saying I'll deal with it right here do it like I'm telling you right now\nMore like a will more like a traditional will\nSo how ... do you need to be I mean ... medical field is changing all the time and there are ways to keep us alive longer their their advances and medication their advances in technology there advances all around us [laughter]\nIf I prepared my well today ten years from now or my durable power for a health care [noise]\nTen years from now there might be something completely new that's available [noise] how specific do I need to be in some of those decisions I Do want this I don't want that in my looking at just keeping myself alive or it's feeding tubes I Know some of those things get mentioned now but down the road there may be a whole new technology well ...\nAnd some people might say that this is kind of like a to borrow a phrase for the past belt and suspenders meaning that you watch them reinforcement when you're choosing to have in place of durable power of attorney for health care as well as a living will so those two working cooperatively can accommodate change\nSo you're right it to the extent that you try to identify through a living will\nAll the potential scenarios\nOr you can by using general language cover a lot of area\nBut but by using your language are also producing gray Ryan gray is something that the lawyers of the hospitals and the doctors or why not do live right it's it's an invitation for litigation with families\nAnd and that the cruise em case and others with which that we're familiar having read about in detail as these as these lawsuits unfolded through multiple courts ending up in the Supreme Court\nAh with with a ... ... cases that\nWe know that there is potential\nFor conflict delay and litigation expats so hospitals and other health care providers would much rather you delegate authority to a person because it does answer your your your question and that\nYou point out that this is a a moving target I mean health care options change and and what now or even Twenty years ago especially would have been limited to three or four Adams ventilator decisions ... continuation of artificial nutrition hydration\nOr maybe ... a ... now we have antibiotics more calmly added to that list so\nThere are several others a handful of things that routinely appear in a living will document for example but\nAs you point out that that list will change over time and suddenly it will become a judgment call so it's good to have both it's good to have a durable power of attorney in the event job of power of attorney for health care in the event that\nThat you you have someone who's available which would be your intention and it's it's a preference of of everyone concerned that there be someone there to answer your questions or to answer the questions rather of the of the health care provider but we all recognize that this person may not be available they may be they may be incontinent at that stage they may be traveling\nWhen a an important decision as to be made they may be in Europe when when something related to discontinue ... and allowing you to accomplish a I'm a gift of of your body to to side sort of transfer of critical organs up those decisions are often very very time sensitive\nAnd and someone can be given that authority through a durable power of attorney for health care to make that that decision but they need that if it's not authorized elsewhere\nSo it's better to have both of them in place a but you you do want to have the living will just because it it's something that may in fact be the operative document depending on who's available\nWhen we're talking today about the documents that you need is you prepare for aging and as you look forward into life durable power of attorney durable power of attorney for health care we invite you to take I can give us a call and ask her questions\nAt three land for nine six nine

back\nIf if she has has given someone the authority to make that decision then no you cannot if she's given a story to anyone else then no you cannot or she's expressed a contrary authority in a living will then you cannot\nBut I Would say that if there are no documents than as a practical matter what happens is the court looks to the closest\nExcuse me not to court but the the care provider will look probably to the closest family member as a practical matter they're not bound legally by that family members decision but I can tell you that that's typically what happens so as a practical matter you\n... your your spouse would be making that decision in the absence of any document to the contrary\nI Would offer my insurance for ... for sure for\nCooperative offer\n... ... and you're also assuming a common accident right something which are both involved\n\nWell ... ... ... in other words an incident in which you're not in a position to make decisions for her so um so as a result you're wondering what is going to go down if she does it in advance indicate that she wants to have the ventilator discontinued et cetera under certain circumstances\nEntity in our\nShow I I we should it should be making each\nYear that's good how old is your son for a teacher okay\nAh I I Would think that that he would be the choice perhaps of both of you\nOr to to be delegated with the authority to be the agent and the ... power of attorney for health care sounds to me like he would be a a good person to make that call both in very commonly that is what happens is is children for both uh after spouses\nShow but I have to overturn\nYeah you you definitely need a both of you should have a durable power of attorney for health care or an addition to incidentally a durable power of attorney which is not subject to this call and you should both have living wills\nAre in order to to be confident that that someone is going to do the right things when you're in a position to no longer tell them to do the right things [noise]\nAlright well thank you for calling Jim we hope that helps you it sounds like maybe if you get your son involved that would be the best way to kind of carry out here which is\nMaybe the sun would arbitrary this dispute\nYeah that's that's a tough call in when two people are not quite a green\nAnd it's a big decision we we all think that this is something that we may not have to deal with ever um and if we do it's a long way away a but in fact the probability is that I don't know what those probabilities\nAre but I Know there are substantial that that all of us will have someone making this decision for us in in all likelihood\nWell right and that's what we are trying to do is trying to prepare had at the time so that our wishes can be carried out I mean you know it's it's heart wrenching to be\nWith a lot of wind and to have to make that decision I understand where maybe him his wife would be coming from is I don't want to be the one that says my husband shouldn't live anymore I Want him to take every opportunity to live\nBut if I Know it's his wishes and it's in there and I can take that emotion out because their documents in place and he's made it really clear and he thought about it and he's prepared for it\nUm and so that might be a little easier and take the emotional aspect of it I'm just a little bit\nYeah yeah and and you know I'm reminded of this in a very personal why it's one thing to deal with it professionally but but you see it in in a different way in a more vivid way of course when it's your family and and my family\nEveryone our age I'm I'm sixty now a we're starting to experience things that we saw more than a professional environment now we're seeing it more personally and I have an aunt with whom I was very close\nTo sail she was at home with her she was eighty five and she fell down the stairs um\nIs she had discontinued the caregivers that we had suggested she keep on twenty four seven so they were coming just part time and this apparently occurred at four so in the morning we're guessing we're not sure where it was mourning\nA she fell down the steps and it wasn't discovered ... hours later this new and in another city\nSo but she didn't have documents in place that at least\nBut she didn't have documents in place that at least that readily accessible turns out the worst some documents but we didn't know where they were ... widow who had authority on in those documents\nSo there was a period of time after she fell when she was unconscious and she was in the hospital and when we arrived a ... of course we were you know hours of course getting their way to travel there but\nUh when we arrived we found that she was on a ventilator and she just looked awful as those of you listening have seen family members and that sort of the of seeing family members that situation and\nAnd uh you know we wanted to intervene to to try to not have or have any pain or suffering but until this document was found\nWe didn't have any authority and so\nI think that that she regained consciousness in that week before she died she was in the hospital for about a week\nOn a ventilator the whole time looking miserable mhm but I don't know the ... she was response a response of or\nOr conscious for U.S Open but but when I say conscious of being cognizant right I I don't know and I and matter of fact my hope is that she wasn't cognizant at all for the moment that her head hit that floor when she fell\nBut ah but I'm concerned she was and so here somebody's captive to the situation where\nThe hospitals simply let things go on in that situation not out of a difference but out of just momentum I mean it's what they do\nRight and their goal is to help you and they do everything medically that they know to do and they certainly don't know your wishes or your aunt places\nYeah and it wasn't as if she'd been like this for a year\nA but just just put yourself in that position do you want to be like that for even a week [laughter] if if you know that that there's just pain and suffering a head of you before you die\nAnd and in this case she had multiple broken bones and and I'm sure\nIf she gained cognizance that that\nShe wanted nothing more than to be out of that situation I there's no doubt in my ... out of that but there was no way to communicate and uh she wasn't clear enough to be able to route or anything besides our hands were were down because of fractures and whatnot so she she had no mobility to express yourself that way so\nUh they they this is just an illustration and some of you could call in many of you could call in and give similar stories um but it\nIt's what can happen when you don't have someone who can rescue you and we knew rescue in this case was relief was being able to go on and quit suffering which in her case in in my opinion took a week longer than it should have\nWell and that's why we're doing this program I mean ... you're right and you said at the beginning of the sometimes when you talk legal things that can sound a little bit dry or a little bit oh no they're talking about that again\nBut the reason that we're doing these things and the reason that we want to stress a lot of these documents is to try and help people make them make their end of life much easier to make things a little bit more I'm comfortable for them\nEvery single one of us are going to age every single one of us are going to have family members that we love who we just can't control that the situation that they find themselves and [noise] and if the right documentation is there it can smoother transition on\n[noise] yeah yeah and uh and and keep in mind this is not just the conversation for ah what you think you might need when you're in your body's\nOr this could be something that would be relevant to you and twenty four hours I mean we just don't know what I mean car accidents and and traumas and and other even health incidences that we didn't know about\nNow you mentioned that your ants actually did have the paperwork but things were still delayed that leads me to the question of why do we need to do to make sure that\nOur wishes are carried out I mean who do we need to tell how do these you know you talked about the different types of power of attorney springing or the one that takes place initially but then how do we communicate that to the hospital or to the doctor or to the bank or to anybody that needs to know that\nWell it is important for the person that you want to take over for you or both with respect to remember there are two documents were talking about here one is a durable power of attorney which is for the financial and legal and the others the durable power of attorney for health care you want both of those to be in the hands of someone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "27"}
