smart\nA parent's hasty and very tasty gas and out of an dogs I'm I've read well in in I I mean as far as train ability what is trained ability mean does it mean you're smarter does it mean you're not smart enough to go hey don't train me well I'm not going to do what you are\nAnecdotally I've heard dog trainer say that the smarter that dog the more difficult to train yes\nRight which makes perfect sense to me and I I you know it all goes back to what intelligence is or how much attention they apparently pay because the dog that we have the we consider to be the smart one she pays attention but she's also incredibly obedient\nSo maybe I'm just thinking she's smart because she's doing what I Want her to do\nWhat you could have a smart dog who is not a medium because the dog is like and you want me to do what and race why\nBut she's ... she's the one that tells time and that freaks me out how did she tell time because if if I'm On the couch and it's evening time but it's before nine thirty and I get up she won't pay any attention to me but if it's after nine thirty and I get up she'll get up and run to the back door\nBecause she knows it's past time for her to go out for the last time before we go to bed also you've got her an apple watch\n[laughter] well yeah but I didn't want to add that and\nThey always know when it's time to eat\nRight but she just she knows if it's before nine thirty oh he's just going to the kitchen to get something to eat or whatever uh and yeah it it is the strange and I never I never trained her to do that it just she noticed and picked up oh if it gets to this time and he gets up it's probably time for me to go out social run to the door\nThat how do you know she probably knows when you're supposed to come home to half a mile before you get
