six on the tax line and there's a story\nAbout how to do with it has now made national news because you know if we're going to make national news it should be for something embarrassing I feel a and this is about a mother who is upset that her son was booted from the JV soccer team so she called her lawyer\nAnd I kind of climate St Louis Post Dispatch ha ha but I'm not clear why they booted him well us off ... soccer facility last\nYear and right and he was going to move up because he went from a sophomore junior so he was going to move up to the varsity team but there were a bunch of kids who didn't make it to the varsity team and he did and he ... he was one of those so they were caught\nIn favor of kids who apparently played better than they did at least according to the coaches coaches saw something in there you know playing that that fits better with their scheme so they cut seven of 'em and he was one of the ones who got\nCut the parents are upset because then he wasn't named to the junior varsity team right\nThey're not allowing him to play JV soccer because he's a junior\nAnd they don't have juniors on their JV team so the parents are saying well that means he can't play soccer at all and the rest of us can a nod and go yup that's what that means [laughter] and so instead of doing that they called her lawyer and now they're suing because of their son can play on the JV soccer team are you kidding\nMe and they don't want to name him in a suit because they're afraid of him being bullied blown everybody now in LA right when he's the\nOnly guy that has the right has added to this and to the JV soccer team meeting season everybody's going to know who it is so afraid of him getting bullied by you know [noise]\nI I just the fact that this is the stuff we gum the courts up when he's just insanely ridiculous to me let's say that this was completely unfair that this kid should have been playing right\nWhy sue exaggerate tell your kid life isn't fair and a lot lot of us try out for things that we don't get\nA I tried out for most things I didn't need to [laughter] or I should say I didn't get most things I tried out of it but yeah that's the whole point is that so if I ask a girl out on a date and she turns me down and can I sue her for emotional distress I think probably so yeah uh you'll find a court that with the least hear that case and you'll probably find them in St Clair county Illinois by\nThat not withstanding um who is it that has something like this happen and says oh my son face some disappointment in high school I'd better call a lawyer right away\nI feel for the kid you know no kidding email because what an awful position to put him in\nNot only that but ah what you pointed out about the fact that you know if he if he is named for the team everybody's going to know who he is anyway\nRyan everybody already knows\nI remember high school she maybe that's maybe that's part of the problem is that I actually have some pretty vivid memories of what life was like back then everybody over I Would guarantee you that everybody in that school knows who it is I don't know yeah they've got to know right ah and so and they're the only ones who matter\nI mean I in in the one thing that I Would love to know that we can't know is what this young man's opinion of what his mother is doing is his mother and stepfather terribly constructed and well yeah you know what is he saying they're going to get me on the team I doubt it\nAnd the stepfather said his law firm has already racked up a hundred thousand dollars and attorney see [laughter]\nWhat a scam um but yeah I mean like you said\n... these kinds of disappointments or not\nAbnormal and you look at them could conceivable benefit from something like this nobody is going to go from the la do high school JV soccer team to the MLS ... okay if you're not good enough that they're not chipping at the bit to have you on the varsity soccer team this is not a career and\nHer and then their club teams right here right ... you know and that's the if you want to go out there and they did hire coach for him and he was on a St Louis club team right\nAnd and if you want to go play soccer you can go play soccer but it would force to try to make the courts forced the high school\nTo you all you know what this is will conceivably end up with is you have to ask

sanitation where the one you're snake in business\n\nFor being here with you on the inside and we got a whole bunch of stuff coming up for you for the remainder of this week will Egypt to speed on a just a little bit one right now we're going to go to something that's happening half a world away in one of the largest many [noise] pardon me video game competition in the world in fact it's called the world's\nIn right now teams from all over the globe twenty for an international teams are taking part in a league of legends tournament this all goes back to each boards and we have on line with us Chris Harper who's the head of North America nice sports it Ryan games in overseas in North American leaders legends championship series Chris welcome\nHey how are you know\nWe started to beginning sent people my age is yes\nThose are your ears meant is the single little thing explain a little bit about the tournament what what what is legal legends first of all let's start their\nChurch so legal margins is the most clean PC him in the world\nAnd say five versus five a competitive multiplayer online ballerina is technically the name of the game but I can think of it as a cross between a sort of basketball and and capture the flag a little bit [noise] um you're playing with four teenage you figure from one of a hundred and forty characters\nThat are in the game and you play until you take out your parents face or they take out your so take five thirty or forty minutes are up your character as you go through each individual game kind of accounting for Strategic objective\nAnd at the end of the game you know it it kinda comes down into the mark and coordination and you know whose team can move more efficiently and and when the if I could be on that really matter\nYou know due the players get paid\nDo this it's just you people make a liberal absolutely\nSo at this point we have actually fourteen leagues around the world\nWhere the players are playing for professional teams that mean for us the players on contracts in North America which is the leader I operate [noise] um the players on average starters are actually making over three hundred and thirty thousand\nDollars a year from their salaries are Seventy percent of the players are multi year contract so um yeah pretty hardy economic situation for this\nGuy said yes we have grandkids who said they want to play video games for landing possible\nActually you know and and what's really exciting about whether the industry is is that even if they're not going to necessarily make a pro player\nThere's so much more for them to do in the industry and they are kind of draw an analogy of pro basketball where only the top\nYou know tens of a percent hundred percent whatever make\nIt to the NBA and they'll probably be the same\nAnd the analysis where there's so many players they're going to be at such a far end of it the talent are kind of pipeline to be able to make it to the poem or fourth exciting is that there's so many other positions for those people get involved in any sports you know you can actually aren't scholarships or ... or a hundred students\nAcross the country on scholarship for playing against and you know for all of this college teams they need coaches are pro teams the coaches are pro teams the analysts\nYou know we're a phone broadcast team we have the on journalists you

he makes it really exciting for people even beyond just those who are pro\nSo did the broadcasters just sit there and go any press the button to lose the Jewish [laughter]\n[noise] now we are or broadcaster actually one of the ... um you know we've sent those guys to train or with a you know some of the best\nFootball and basketball commentators out there and they're able to kind of analyze for\nThe audience what's going on in the game you know what the kind of things look out for the next couple of minutes are uh you know whether to power spice might be which team a stronger and why I guess the audience a sense of what to look out for him but also to serve a better understanding of kind of the game progression so\nYou know even for new are fans of newer audiences they're able to some kind of stay in tune in and understand what's going on with the game\nIn one of the things that we all learned over the last couple of months about east orange is the you talked about the scholarships and the money that's involved in this store also sponsorship so kids get trapped by companies who say we want you to represent us while you're playing the game right\nSorry I missed the last part of the questions are sponsorships\nOut there who is sponsoring these kids to play games\n\nUm so what was the author and said you have the industry has an option\nScene is is really expanding right now you know um what do you think about when the leaves launched back into the other team together fourteen it was just kind of in that mix sponsors to the ecosystem it was you know\nLarger attack razor ... area where you know companies that we're creating gaining PCs or you know building a new car peripheral three and the the things that directly to these sports but now you're actually saying\n... come in including you know fourteen hundred companies I'm Ryan ... which is the company to Craig's list or what is the company I work for just about the global partnership with MasterCard to become one of their um you know events they sponsor in the in the priceless campaign\nOr you know one of our leaders ... is partnering with Mercedes Benz I Wish the partnership for jeep with American Express for Nissan ah where they see the you know we're seeing a lot of these major lifestyle brands coming into the scene or who are looking for your exposure to our audience are demographic\nI'm excited about your learning more about their fans and being able to present to them and kind of creative inorganic was\nDoes mean eating three or four seven zero three three eighty on line and we'll see\nJohn Greece and and Jennifer Blow\n\nYour caregiver for somebody with mental illness you know how stressful and I can be near our resources\nTo help you there's an event tonight and cry and her health center in St Peter's and we have on line with that now seated deal who is a co author of a book called circle of care a guidebook for mental health care cameras thank you so much for joining us\n\nHello are you there um hello I'm having a hard time hearing you\nKnow high speed and this is Jennifer and John Will try to work in the levels can you hear something in her home there how are you great so can you tell us about this as dense as part of mental illness awareness week that's taking place tonight at a crime or help center\nSure absolutely um and we're going to be talking about a new caregiver guide for caregivers of adults with mental health conditions like depression or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or by our post traumatic stress disorder [noise]\nA lot of people think about the individual and and and we're making strides and helping people who live with these conditions [laughter]\nBut uh we haven't really wrap their arms around the people who care for them and many of them devote years ... years and hours and hours to helping their loved one recover\nNo doubt and how much do those responsibilities change with an adult versus caring for a trial ... was the same issues\nWell when when when you're caring for a child um here the responsible adult\nHere included in the health care team um it's still very complex you know you're trying to deal with the schools and the medical providers for the mental health providers and you know so it's still very complicated but the minute a personal turns Eighteen they're an adult and\nWhat happens to caregivers ear suddenly shut out of the care team so even though you know the person well you're with them on a daily basis\nAnd you have information that would help treatment be more effective and you probably need information in order to help the person who follow through on care\nAbout the your ears shut out of the process and it probably mostly because of an over stringent interpretation of health privacy law because federal law and state laws actually allow from our communication than most mental health providers realize\nBut it's a it's a real it's an agony for families to know that they know their loved one and they would like to help their loved one but there are shut out of the process\nAnd snowy and their solution to that he does\n[noise] um the author is and the solution is really a relatively simple to talk about if you know sort of like many things that civil to talk about and difficult to do\nWith the first thing is to educate providers but actually there is the first thing to do is to educate caregivers because there are steps that they can take\nTo talk with their loved one you know and and ... times when I'm when things are going well and that's the case with mental illness it comes and goes\nThere so there are times when things are on a relatively even killed so you talk with your loved one about\nWhat would help you you know if if I can start to go south again and how can I support cheer and develop a plan with the person that you love and then together approach the providers and there's nothing to prevent\nA person in care from getting permission for the family to work with the care team and so you approach the provider you set up a communication plan [noise] um you know you're kind of testing and talk to the legal people at the mental health center and and do um you know this\nWhat do we need to tweak in order to make this work of times get hired and once you've set up that kind of to communication plan things go better that's one of the ... that actually in this guidebook\nThe guidebook Harris twelve kept cheap with tips for caregivers and to help them uh promote recovery him and the person that they love to\nSee the deal is you're with us again the co author of circles care a guidebook for mental health care or caregivers and you make an excellent point because I think most of us who are not in the situation of being a caregiver don't realize that most of the time you're ...\nYour health care professional rather just people at home and and so even those times were age as you described sort of in between a episodes of of mental disease taking over\nOne of the hard parts for the caregivers the things that those of us an album that situation would never think of\nWell the hard parts are ... a mental illnesses episodic as I said so it comes and goes and so and the good times you know you and the person that you love are doing well but uh it often doesn't it can't see it on the outside of you you start to have this\nSense that things are going wrong and so sometimes loved ones will say are you OK I'm you know it's I'm worried and can I help and then the person themselves because I'm fine\nMore and and can I help and then the person themselves because I I'm fine you know and so they got to push people away until it starts to kind of get over the edge and then it's you know then it's a very difficult to stop sliding into a crisis\nRight because the the unlike other illnesses that the person with mental illness one of the symptoms his lack of insight into when they began to in some cases\nSome of them for if that's the case and with others like depression or anxiety you know the person may have an exaggerated idea of how well they are so it's it's difficult just because metal on the ... um it's it's difficult to\nHelp the person that was the main the main difficulty if I'm getting at the person wants to be independent themselves and you love them and so what we say and the care and the circle of care guidebook is\nEmphasized how much you love them how much you care and that she went to help them and keep that trust going and that trust is what family through\nSo that's not easy but it does it does help\nMuch talking about expanding that trust out one level as well so if we were friends with somebody again you everybody wants to respect everyone's privacy but if we have a friend who we know is a caregiver somebody with a mental health issue what is our role in this do we even have one or we just on the outside giving support\nI think it's very important you know somebody who's carrying corporate with mental illness to be there with them and for them because we found in a couple of studies that mental health care givers\nUm number one devote more time you know for years on and more years more time per week and caregivers overall but number two they're really isolated they have much less access to professional support\nBecause of the stigma of mental illness um people don't know what to say they often go away and in fact what you should do is\nUm you know emphasize how much you care for the caregiver and ask how you can help just listening ear you don't have to give advice you don't know how to know what to say this to say I'm here for you and I care and how can I be helpful\n... circle of care a guidebook for mental health care givers thank you for
