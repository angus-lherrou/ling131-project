Seventy years from doing the math right\nMy mother married the previous owner in Nineteen Seventy eight while so I've been in it since Seventy eight\nSo Ramona we've seen people come in to get a batteries fixed and jewelry claimed how do you typically suggest people keep their jewelry claim\nDon't wear it all the time [laughter]\nAnd don't wear your jewelry when you're gardening or cleaning the house\nI'm treated like you would a fine outfit yeah do you do a lot of repairs we do a lot of repair yeah we we have um I really very good jeweler my ex husband\nStill you're you're you're right I used to do all the repairs but I had chemo for a year and my fingers don't work properly\nI don't want to damage anyone's jewelry so he stepped in and he's been doing it for the past three years\nIn Kenya ... bring up people get older and their fingers get bigger\nYou can as when the knuckles get too large for the back of the finger tends to make a problem but there's little seizing balls that can be put in a different things we can figure out\nSometimes you just have to deal with it during that flies around\nBut yeah that's true and the other thing that's going on here is that not only are there are some great prices and all of a jury but there were ... everywhere talk about what's on the table behind you deserve some cookies and some crackers wonderful things and as I understand this is also part of the family rides\nYes my mother makes all of the cookies and people sometimes just come in for her cookies [laughter] she she's a wonderful Baker I she tried to teach me how to bake\n'em a pound cake the other day and I thought she was going to just fall over laughing\nI made a mess [laughter] oh that's all again good to know but you know you should tell her start selling the cookies\nYou know I I've I suggested that but she said it steps to hardware is too hard\nSo Ramon is their state jewelry here also\nYes we do have some estate jewelry that we've purchased from people's estates also jewelry that people don't want anymore and they sell it if it's in good shape I Will clean it up and check it and\nPut it for sale again so somebody can enjoy it\nI'm not surprised that I was just looking at romano's rings and beautiful gorgeous and oh what's the most popular on engagement ring now that people are looking\nFor a job right now the cushion cut and oval are getting very popular and downs but around brilliant is still always going to be the most popular could ups the classic classic and well yeah that's the way it\nIt tends to go to any desire any design any style and\nDidn't there used to be a formula for if a young couple is looking ... rang about what they should spend\nThere or was it was three months salary while that proved today people\nAre all over the place today and what they want to spend I think some of the younger people\nDon't want to spend as much on an engagement ring and they wanted to spend it on the house or something like that and then other people\nYou know they they stick by that rule though some men come in and they said this is what I make and\nThis is my budget and I was like not exact\nTogether and do most young men wear wedding rings I just ask because I remember my father said aware a ball and chain and a sign that says I'm married but I'm not wearing jewelry really now he would have been on you know like a hundred today but\nYeah a lot of do we there's um a lot of men that work with their hands have learned to where some of the stretch earrings or not a ring at all so they don't damage their hand or lose their finger [noise] but I think men still like to where not only their wedding ring but there is some fashion rings especially the younger people\nTo fill that saying that I feel like I'm an old\nFashioned rang I guess\nI'm sort of the wedding rings true this is a titanium I think or something like that and in the movies I Love because I've had gold rings in the past you know just go bands\nAnd the show he's big they get knocked around the good thing to the you know they will get the real deal do all over time because we get scratching manageable softer than like platinum murders yelling silver version will keep on this at all\nBut there's there's really an infinite number beer cart\nYou can make 'em it's really only limited by your imagination and a lot of ways so I and my buddy Nick Bennett who's actually part time there with the moustache to prove it this far fortunately in New York City\nCome up with some really basic but absolutely essential\nCome up with some really basic but absolutely essential ones and they range from a essentially making a little bit of a beer boiler makers or with a Morrow and beer 'em and adding a little bit of bitterness\nCheer drink and you can make it just by pouring two things together and then it ranges up to the the highlights give them a for which you have to create a beer simple syrup um which is like the the ... be a\nMixture of that a bartender we used a lot of cocktails but in this case we're making it would Miller high life and it's really pretty fun and then you can keep that just sitting around and use it whenever you want but uh yeah definitely enjoyable and you know exploring new flavors is as part of what it's all about [noise]\nThen what's the latest your beer I Know sometimes when my boys and by any means car for a while [laughter]\nI think he needs this book that is definitely\nNot the best way to store here um especially like temperature shifts and changes are one of the things that are at least affect them and obviously like extremely high temperatures are something that you don't want you want a freezer beer [noise] um but it depends on the type of beer or a lot of IP a raise\nYou actually want to keep cold um throughout as much as possible and you definitely don't want major fluctuations and definitely not multiple fluctuations to just keep those in the fridge and drink them and you generally want a drink them you know pretty quick after they've been bought or even really after they've been made\n'em but there are beers especially\nA bigger scouts barley wines um some sour beers\nThat you can age for extended amounts of time I'm five years ten years sometimes longer and news keep 'em you know somewhere around sixty sixty five degrees uh hopefully somewhere nice in dark basements are great for this\nUm and they change over time and different flavor characteristics come out [noise] um and you can actually you know take the same here I'm from the same brewery that was produced in different years\nUh enlighten them all up and and see how that's changed that's pretty fun thing to do pretty good excuse to open five beers or wants\nTo have some friends over for that one I don't I don't need an excuse to do that\nThen we can you wrote the accents only began and report now from Ramona Elmer ... where we are\nHere we go to Ramona what kind of being or do you use any more than some pieces but now there's ...\nIt's a ... global\nWarming silver piece that many Chinese still tiny gold peace with some diamonds and diamonds are clear nights they didn't need to return is Google peace cannot beautiful\nOutright Nichols Field he\nDoesn't look any different looks at the same\nWoman in gold plated silver earrings ...\nSo you want to stay away from anything slated sounds like the related than if it's going to work\nOne day I think I can\nPlay there is a little bit of a tricky area there I'm like I'm so happy that we actually\nRan this line of work to\nRobin says you're with is the book is beer hacks hundred tip strict some projects and you know who the other thing I think everybody has been in this situation where are you in somebody brings beers and they don't have the twist all caps and they all look at each other going okay who brought the opener\nAnd there's that moment of all no so you have an open or in the book which is great it comes with one that comes in your wallet is like credit card sized there are some things some tricks that you can do to open a beer in the absence of an actual bottle opener right\nDefinitely having a beer and no opener um initially seems like a dark place\nBut really\nOne of the ... it's a kind of launched the idea for the book that I've been using a ever since college was\nSomebody's always got to pick later on them and using the proper technique of gripping the bottle and and waging polite or I guess your finger [noise] and the cap um it's actually very easy\nOnce you get it down to pop that beer open and that kind of became like a bit of a fun party trick\n'em so that's a basic one you know back to the jury if you can't use your wedding ring um you do want to be careful if it's cold just because it's a soft battle but like I Know people who have ... painting a wedding rings those are great letter rep\nUm you can use a door jam or I've open beers and and wrote about it in the book with another beer hum than pray that the universe didn't collapse in on itself\nThere's\nYou know I think there's a lot of it is one of the spaces where I think there is the most room for creativity in and ingenuity [noise]\nDentist glass glassware manner\n[noise] it\nDoes so the way that I like to ... or ... it can um the way I like to look at it is we should drink the beer that you like can you should drink it out of whatever you like 'em but maybe you do want to consider every once in a while trying something different and see if you like that\nUm there there's glassware hum that is made for specific types of beer works better whether it kind of promotes the carbonation and the right way um I like a nice kind of rounded to live shapes Belgian beer glass\nUm that flares out a little bit of the top because it allows you to smell and pick up on some of the Arab Maddox\nOf the beer that really helped the flavor out I'm One of the ones that you actually do really want to be careful with is the frozen glasses that you'll sometimes see it bars um to get your beer ripping cold [noise] there's a couple of problems with those\nA big one being that the ice crystals will melt and dilute your beer and changed the robot in a negative way and also I worked at a number of bars and restaurants in my years and we would clean a lotta things at the end of the night but nobody was in there screaming out the inside of the freezer\nSo it's got its picking\nThose up both flavors and whatever else you there um so if you like that go for it you know if this gives you an even a little bit of pause then maybe you want to ask them if they got another option\nNo doubt and we've got just a minute or two but I I wanted to mention that the you know there are so many things that the reviews worry we mentioned polishing pure gold and silver jewelry is one of them you can also I remember when beer ... back in the seventies became a big thing so one of the things that you find you can use beer for the most people wouldn't think of\nThe ship\nPoint wanted as great a Catherine zeta Jones I found in my research um swears\nBy watching her hair with beer so yeah\nThat's about as good a recommendation as you get wrapped slugs and your back yard um if you dig a little hole and and put a glass and they're like they love it and then you're you know worrying less about slugs you can ward off some fruit flies they'll also be attracted every every every creature on this earth\nIs biologically predisposed to like beer\nCreature on this earth is biologically predisposed to like beer and sometimes you have to take advantage of that\nWhere you sit and be used to I mean you can use them for all kinds of pest control the downside to that is the mosquitoes tend to like people who drink beer\nWhich is a bummer for your time here but there's also some of the book including\nHow to make 'em tiki torches that you can fill up from old bottles of beer hello there so that the problem is that the solution is a little bit about what's going on this book\nJim website [noise]\nI Would if you're looking for the book on Amazon you can get it wherever books are so those people should support or local booksellers um and just you know keep your eyes on Amazon Books out there that I think everybody is\nNo doubt call beer acts of hundreds tips tricks in projects been Robinson thank

was invented a new holiday and uh this one Jennifer speaks directly to you because it's it's sort of drug related he's invented this thing a holiday it's yeah it's related to rules\nAnd each year he just decided that in fact his mother asking me wishes or where did you come up with this idea and he said and I love this quote it came from my brain maybe ... years old and he invented this holiday a and all of a sudden it's taken off online I think he's in New Zealand\nAnd it it took off on line and then all of the sudden people are starting to celebrate this thing and using it to fund raised for dog a charities and dog rescues and things like that and it it just as being a become this explosive thing and it's a sort of a a Christmas myth we're talking about the spirit of the great wall fell a little\nBoy says the spirit of the wealth brings in high small gifts around the house for everyone and\nAlso this little boys as a holiday celebrated by eating ... because that's what what was the most of their meat all those are good vegetarians can celebrate killed [noise] and he also takes the cake or has his mom do a declaration to look like a full moon\nSo you're going to hold a little bit at a Facebook page about it and I he little boy is very concerned about people who are kind of dogs and he thinks they should get that I guess than other people you\nDefinitely show where you have a spirit of the great wolf knows just remember that he knows how kind of your dog she'll be kinder to them and the other one across the desk just a little bit ago\nAbout an eight year old girl in Sweden which is nowhere near New Zealand by the way I'm ... and she was out playing around in a lake by her house a little pond\nAnd uh she stepped on something and she thought okay I Wonder what this is ... and she reached down and found a pre Viking interests short while I was just very little to see this is not how archeology usually happens\nHowever sometimes eight year olds do the most amazing things so she she picked this thing up when I was trying to do the math on this they said it's about eighty two centimeters long\nWhich I think is about three feet\nSo that's a pretty hefty sword wow I'll say and uh she was able to get it they they figure after initial ah you know once over by the local um the the actual archaeologist they looked into this thing and they said it's about a thousand years old but uh uh later they they have to talk to a local\nGuy very another archaeological agency and they said that dates back to the fifth or sixth century a deep so what will happen to it now so now it's going to go I Would presume to a museum\nOr if they're going to look a little bit more into some of the mental working that went on and in the overtime of course knew me to this thing has been in a lake or underground for fourteen hundred years now\nSo it's got a little bit of I'm Wondering whether you're ... degree or whatever it is that they had a great yeah that a cooler collects on it and so they're going to try to clean it off as much as they can and figure out the exactly what the provenance of this thing was they are another Providence but the the origin of it was\nA they initially thought well maybe she stumbled upon a cemetery mhm because back then it was not uncommon for people to ...\nShe stumbled upon a cemetery\nBecause back then it was not uncommon for people to have swords and things like that buried with him but now for whatever reason they've they've said no it probably isn't that it just is something that either somebody dropped along the way or that ah you know somehow ended up there and they're not sure\nBut that's part of a mystery now that they're going to try to uncover wow that is amazing all because of one really alert a payroll and yeah\nThat's right it's grown out of those costs just remember that uh but yeah it it is cool that you're getting kids sometimes do the most amazing things and they don't need to have somebody teach them how to do it they just go out and do it they're curious and look what happened meanwhile [laughter]\nThis is another one of my favorite stories of the day you know we look around here and obviously this is a jewelry store shows security is something that you have to have any anything now\nBut more and more ... by way of the sort of ring video door bells and there's a bunch of different competitors of popped up to them and other security cameras people are starting to put these things around their houses\nAnd the more we turn to a culture that using the delivery services like Amazon or with a box food deliveries and things like that\nOf the more that's attracting criminals who come in and just steel boxes off of a porch thinking maybe there's something valuable inside\nWell because people have so many more security cameras we catch them a lot more work than we used to which is good news a show in one particular case and this one comes out of Seattle, Washington and the guy who walked up to this house in Seattle and stole a bunch of stuff off the porch\nAnd they got great security camera shots of him I mean they look like wedding photos and he's wearing a hat and I swear I'm not making this up he's wearing a baseball cap that says do good I'm my own stealing there's\nAt least it wasn't the best 'cause I think that would have been Riley weird but ah yeah do good

thoroughfare gravel and all of that are are part of this\nNone of those roads twenty two percent are in poor condition\nNow they did not say on stage fright they just said in need of\nRepair at right there just in bad shape potholes and and the other the overtime the road sort of get to that wave in it where you are ... just from having cars drive over it it's just not good any more of the road services are bad but that's almost one in four\nNow and I know a lot of you listen to us when you're driving around if you want to go to the tax line aid for one to sex I'd be interested in knowing which roads do you think the worst which may you drive over every day\nYeah and in the entire university city area even before they started doing all the construction on dome are for the trolley it was always bad\nA ... not that much better show you know that that's a tough area to drive in and there are several other places where I I always dread going because I Know you know there's going to be that piece of at the ... going to be rough to drive over ...\nShow yeah if you want to give us a little hands on the tax line where you see the worst of the worst knew that aid for one to six and we'll do our own little survey of the major roads Manchester\nAs we mentioned it depends on where you are I mean that's a very ... and the manager and gravel yeah long roads so some pieces of them are really in great shape and that other pieces are nuts and the\nTimes it's a little side routes to which I'm sure I'm not even included in that survey\nRight yeah this is just major roadways but yeah you're right if you have to get off the main thoroughfare and try to get around a couple of days ago when two Seventy stacked up and I made the jogger Lindbergh and came up because Tim while it's awesome and\nAh even there there was a minor reckon Lindbergh and if I had to get off and really there's nowhere to go at that point but if you get back into those back roads you're asking for trouble
