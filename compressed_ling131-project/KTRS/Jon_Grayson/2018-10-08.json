I mean twenty people it's Eighteen ... inside the vehicle and two of them outside too high standards forced his terrorists right and there was a a pair of newlyweds there was a kind of a small wedding party involved and all of this is well it just an awful awful story but now\nThe ... a little bit more information is starting to come in the questions about what happened there are are really starting to come into some some stark relief because ah I happened to catch a couple of news conferences live or on Facebook oddly enough over the weekend kept giving these alerts there's another press conference going on\nAnd they were very reluctant and for good reason I'm not picking on them but the sheriff's office in that area was very reluctant to see much of anything about the mechanics of what caused the crash because at that point they really didn't have enough information and they didn't want to get out ahead of the story and say something that was going to be an accurate to their credit [noise]\nUh but it was it was tough to kind of picture what had gone on here and now we learn that initially they had a boss\nThat this ... this group of people was on\nSomething went wrong with the bus so they had to transfer over to this limousine and uh it's a it's not just a it's not a limousine like you would conceive when somebody says limo it's a it's a stretch Ford Excursion which is the excursion is not only an SUV it's Ford's biggest SUV\nSo it's a stretch and shy and truck\nWhich I I've never driven one I I couldn't tell you anything about it except that just to look at it from the outside when you take something that big and make it that long it's going to be nearly impossible to uh to navigate with that thing it's the handle you've got to be terrible ...\nWas asking me this morning if there were seatbelts then I have no idea there\nAre but the only people in the sheriff did actually mentioned that uh during the first press conference the only people required to wear seatbelts or the driver and front seat passenger\nAnybody by just like any car or anybody behind that is not required to wear them but they are equipped on all of the seats Singh is uh the other part of the story that we just learned this morning\nIs that when they switched from the bus to the SUV or the young lady and I believe it was the one who is the newly wed she was texting family members talking about what terrible condition that truck was really and she didn't specify she didn't say what it was you know could have just been dirty and you know\nThings falling apart on the inside but if it's falling apart of inside chances are it's falling apart underneath\nToo I mean we now the driver ran a stop sign and then ... occupied SUV right\nAnd and another one of the questions that came up early on his did he run that stops on because the brakes failed right and they said we don't know yet we're still in the middle of trying to sort through all of this and they figure that out there's a couple of ways you can do it uh there are obvious ways like you're just trace all the brake lines to see if there are any any of the more leaking [noise]\nUh but there are also some things every vehicle and I want to say it since Nineteen Ninety six\nHas had what's called an automotive black box\nAnd what it does is uh it it\nIn the case of something out of the ordinary happening it records that so it will record for example a hard stop if you stop on the brakes your car knows you did that it All right down were computer\nAh at one time that happened one time and the drive what kind of conditions were going on digital slide of you know we're we're ah just how fast you're going when you hit the brakes that sort of thing and that stays for a period of time\nSo if it stays for an hour then there'll be able to go back and look into that automotive black box to see what was going on and whether anybody hit the breaks I Know\nBystanders that it sounded like an explosion\nRight and and that's the other thing is what happened was there was there trouble and I think this is the biggest question is was there trouble before the crash trouble with the vehicle itself and again if it was in poor condition\nThey would lend wanted to believe that there could have been with us that story yeah so it it's going to take them a long time to figure it out but will is we've already gotten some information this is what it's going to be is anecdotal information from people who were in contact with the people that were on that bus I'm aware of this happened\nAnd I I Know it's it's a little tough to kind of picture upstate New York in your head but it's not very far away from Cooperstown it's probably about a Fifteen or twenty minute drive from ... percent New York\nUm than it's a fairly well traveled road because there are a couple of tourist destinations right in that area a mirror caverns and things like that that people go to and you can go and do the tourists thing um so it's it's not very crowded but it's also not deserted by any means and I am from indications they were out\nYes today's the day of service for St Mary's hospital didn't tell me the dragons and Valerie Todd joined us right now the principal at St Mary's high but has been here for twenty\nTwo year thank you for joining ... thanks for being here today so you to grow up in the neighborhood I did I did ask about\nFive blocks down the street so have you seen the neighborhood changed over the years it has changed I think the demographics have changed but I think um what's that stayed the same as people that it's not my dedicated to this area are dedicated to this area and um that's neat to see\nWe're we're seeing a lot of that now and you just heard the voices of a couple of students from it\nTo say we're receiving a lot of it now and you just heard the voices of a couple of students from here but I sort of big smile on your face when they were talking about how teachers don't want you to fail they want you to succeed there's those that support that comes from school talk a little bit about fostering that and making sure that that keeps going because you've been the principal do your for your\nWell you know I think um we certainly have a particular culture here at St Mary's where that is just fostered and are\nUm you know we've had boys come to St Mary's from this area for years and years and we're you know our draws even bigger now on south county north county north city but\nUm you know their their dedication to the well being of the students has always been there and I think that is really what draws people um to St Mary's is they come in and they feel like home right away I think we get that\nWe get that a lot from people so\nJohn and I have chatted in the past about what we did wrong in high school and we have friends that work these days it case not that any of you know and he said to her that my friend tells me I\nStill have detention we do the tension but actually we do um restored of discipline here so I'm really what happens is when a student may get in trouble um for one reason or another\nUm it's about I'm Talking to the student to um it's really ... me put it in their hands and ask them you know what have you done that fact has fractured the community and now what can you do to rebuild\nThat community that you fractured by whatever action um that happened so it's really about um them owning um what they've done and how can they build back that community that ...\nPossibly was um you know damaged by their arm that's great majority of justice\nAnd when we talked with Mike ... when he was just a little while ago about the fact that you know you see them the pictures of the kids when they're out there doing this work they really understand what this means to the community talk about the response from the community\nYou know we um every year you know you get I even I was out working just on the street um before I came in here and\nA gentleman stopped and just said thank you and he was stopping at each of the groups and just said thank you for what you're doing thank you for what you're doing and um you know I think that's what's really neat for the boys to as they get that from um that people in the community as\nActually doing the work they get the feedback right right away and um you know and last year even just the stories of how many people honked as they are going by and waving and\nThings like that you know I think that means a lot to the boys so Valerie Todd you're the principle of an all boys high school I guess in two thousand Eighteen that's no big deal right that you're female you're the principal and nice\nYeah yeah I you know I've been here for quite some time I um I really do I love the boys I Love that I have two boys in my own so it's kind of what I'm used to know how old are yours um I actually have a senior in a sophomore here so\nThey're not going to ask you know it does that ever get tricky having your own songs in school where you're the French sometimes\nIt does sometimes it dies um you know I think what my older son tends to kind of ignore me and my younger son he's the one that came up here and there was always the way he um he tends to be around a little bit more so it doesn't you know quite annoyed him as much but\nThis year I give it to any special\nThing you'd like to tell our listeners in case I Know you have an open house coming up in November\nI think just you know I'm kind of like I said before I think it really is just about being here and feeling what it's like to be on this campus and I'm getting to know our boys so if you haven't been down to the south side and being the St Mary's give us a shot I think that's\nThe biggest message that um I can get some people it's a great place and um you know it's a wonderful place for all students and we have a place for all students do\nUm you know I think that is another reason that so many um boys do so well is because we do have a place\nPlace for everybody and then are there dancers or events with girls' schools yes um we actually had we had our homecoming dance was just this past Saturday So\nUm we um that you know for the girls come from all you know from all over the boys invite them but we also just this past that we had our spirit week last week and homecoming was coming football game was this past friday\nAnd we invited members that it can go down so the bunch of the girls were there and their cheerleaders were cheering and so it was it was great to have them some with us on campus to\nContinue to progress in a number of different areas we talked about the fact that you're looking forward to possibly putting in a theater building and that sort of thing but a academically a talker go above that portion of it and how she marries keeps up or not all the schools around the area but schools around the country as well\nCertainly well we I'm I'm One of the biggest things we do is you know we do have a strong honors and doing all my program so we offer sixty one credit says um college credit that students have the I ... to a chain\nUm you know many of our students graduate I'm already a sophomore in college yeah wow so they get their freshman year pretty much yeah because they have they have most of their core\nUm college curriculum you know ready to go\nAnd then the last few years to we've really been trying to um change our elective offerings I'm so that our students are um\nYou know getting exposed to different career field I was talking to you about our law classes so we have understand why one and two and we didn't have to at first but the kids were so excited about it too so we're offering that we're broadcasting class this year\nUm computer technology and took my job [laughter]\nThey have a few years ago that um so it's really about giving them exposure to things they're interested now\nBut also um you know opportunities to get practice in what they may um do as a career option\nThat is fantastic salary cuts the principle of St Mary's highschool thank you for chatting with us and having us
