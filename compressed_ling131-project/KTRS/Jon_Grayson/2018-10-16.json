information\nYou know I think you asked me money to ... yeah the tickets now ... says what ticks\nMe off as this people who've speed up cut you off and exit the highway when there's no traffic behind you next ran into so many traffic accidents this morning on his way to work it made me grateful that have given up the highway\nAnd that is actually what I'm ticked off about I hate the traffic stuff with ticked off Tuesday because it's the most common thing that we are ... in the morning and he for one to six is the most common thing that people call about but I understand it's nice to get it off your chest and I passed no less than five different traffic accidents some cars were totaled\nUp front in smashed up there was one car I couldn't even see inside to the driver or the passengers because the airbag was completely covering the inside of the car and smoke was coming from the from the hood of the car there was even an action\nSmoke was coming from the from the hood of the car there was even an accident involving a school bus on my way into work all the kids seem fine now but the car the rear ended though however did not look good and the reason why I'm ticked off about it is because [noise] yes it took me more than an hour to get to work today and I was frustrated by that\nBut of course I I shouldn't be the one frustrated I was slightly delays in getting indicates your essay but I'm fine my car is fine I was on the cause of any accident I myself was not hit\nBy anybody else and I feel bad for those people who have been major league inconvenient because of\nA ... I I think a lack of uh being aware of your surroundings and aggressive driving\nAnd I think that's what makes me ticked off today we all have to get to work or what your schedule is some people work third shift and they're going to work at six AM some people are coming home at six AM some people are getting up at three o'clock in the morning to go to work we all have to do that we're all in a rush\nYou know I left my eyes have plenty of time today but there's been days when because of various reasons I over sleep or I didn't get my morning coffee or I have something that Oscar school and there's times when I I feel it in a rush I better get into work I have to get into work\nBut once you're out there on the highway and doesn't get you to work that much faster\nAnd my point is everybody else is feeling that same kind of stress\nEvery car around me is also have to get to work on short we can all slow down and we can all take a deep breath\nWe can all I don't know let people merge because that was not happening today I was cut off by somebody a ... in the in the service truck I'm not going to say what company it was but it was doubly anger reached that it was a person working for a company to cut me off\nYou know way and that was ending any way\nThey would have ended up just behind me but instead they wanted to gun the engine and then get right and I just was so angry about that and then after passing actually an after action\nThey all could have been prevented if we all would just take a deep breath and realize you'll get there when you get there some people would have gotten a license plate number and then we put it down to the company that\nDid they do have those how my driving yeah exactly so but I don't know I just it's there's no reason for that many action on\nOne thing that used to really ticks tick me off you know men can always rent a tuxedo\nFor a wedding the black tie event but women were not given that same you know women would go out and spend like a formal dress too much money right under dress for a formal occasion they had to go to that they would never wear again and for some reason in the past week different two articles about these two young women who started a company called rent the runway\nNow they started at ten years ago when they were both at Harvard Business school\nAnd it's a subscription service so you rent high end close you can do it as a one time rentals or their unlimited one women will spend I Believe it's a hundred and fifty nine dollars a month\nThey get four pieces of clothing in the mail very high end designer clothing and then they can rotate them out for another one so the reporter who was doing a story for the New Yorker said she added it up it's like Nineteen hundred dollars a year\nFor high end clothing but some of the subscribers and there are many said they have stopped buying clothes wow they already have you on how many women do you know who say they have a closet full of clothes to\nWear all and end of the outfit to they've worn what's\nRight and they have a huge warehouse in Secaucus New Jersey they're opening a second one in Dallas but the people who work there you also get free shipping and insurance\nBut some of the employees have to smell the clothes after they've been dry cleaned does it becomes a perfume wanted to make sure that they don't smell like a person ... so they go through a lot to make them\nWearables gently used and these are like nine hundred dollar dresser mission to do that with taxes as well right I mean if I'm wearing some sort of Old Spice or something with my life as I rented I bring it back it's going to smell like for his use of that might have to do something about that yeah we have a caller on the line yeah\nHello John thanks for calling Katie arrest what takes you off\nWell you know I agree with you on the service trucks cut you off [laughter] I usually do I call the company because her numbers right on the side true and I want to know is this a few weeks ago when this guy was Eighteen wheel it was\nJust pick up truck got fifty five [laughter] I called the company the guy knew exactly what was going to want to get [noise] some people just need to remind everyone that represent the company and other names plastered all over the vehicle you got to be a little bit more\nArms are agree Mike well this is John ... not really ticked off I was just like hike for here on TALK of\nWe have a texture who says I'm ticked off about ... died and work on the PS be no wonder now one from Illinois and wants to come to Missouri\nYeah I guess the work is going to be going on for quite some quite some time so but I mean hopefully it'll be it'll be wonderful when it's all completely\nAnother tax just as if people would leave even ten minutes earlier they wouldn't have to speak to get to work in somebody else's way too expensive to rent the runway they also have a one time rental say so and there was a woman so I don't think they have the men's division yet but want it to rent a dress for some fancy event you have to go to um\nWhat do the rams one time the demand would rent a tuxedo or\nListen to your rent a dress let's say I'm picturing some sort of blue evening address off the shoulder really fancy I don't know why that popped into my head and let's say that you go out you have a great time of year cocktail a party and then you love the stress can you then buy it at a discount because you've already rented it\nYes and one of the women quoted in this New Yorker a article a subscriber said she had to quit [laughter] oh really because she was buying she she subscribes so that she would rent clothing she liked it so much that she started buying it at half\nOff yes that would definitely be mean not that I'm wearing a lot of women's dresses these days but I could see myself in a similar circumstance thing but I like the ... I don't want to give it back for the texture said if everybody would leave Simmons earlier they wouldn't have to speed to get to work on time that is true however on a day like today\nWhere I left my normal time plenty of time to get to work but there were those accidents you're still going to be delayed it's nice to remember to keep your cool\nThat you know count your blessings you are not involved in that direction because people get all been out of shape about that ...\nSpeaking of counting your blessings another texture says he doesn't really even know Charlie Rutherford sounds like a nice guy and he was ...\nSo I Do think he was ... or we can go back to the soldier okay it looks like we have Mohammed online hello Mohammed\nI you're good how are you know I\nMy first time calling your show but I'm a big fan of five fifty and McGraw you'd rather long long time ago [noise] and I called him this morning to make a comic but I had another call so they just started short I'm just ... off of what has happened to that you'll notice in Turkey\nI took it was it your presentation didn't go well or if your boss is on your case about something or have you and your co worker you know if we really Springer is being met mean to me or something that the article saying it's okay to go into the restroom have a good cry but your presentation failure getting a chewed up by the boss I don't think so at all\nHere's the thing a lot of women get angry and they cry when they're angry because we have not been allowed to express anger and direct and straightforward way such as if Dr Ford had been as angry\nAs judge Kevin she or he criticized in a way that he would not be because she's a woman\nAnd so we are just socialized as women to feel angry but not be able to express it because the anger is also a feeling that is not\nAcceptable and many human beings and you know it's just a feeling and so women cry and if they're called on the carpet by the boss they tried very hard not to cry because it's seen as a sign of weakness show and then if a woman is angry and expresses that an inappropriate way\nI Believe she's often criticized for that to how or how does this affect men if it if it will I think if a man cries it\nThat it is looked at as a sign of weakness unless he should be allowed to\nI mean ... is seen as as as a sign of weakness for both genders for me there's really no ... no difference if if our boss choose us out\nAnd you cry and cry shortages weakness to everybody in the office I mean right I don't think there's any difference when it comes on the gender as far as crying in ... in the workplace now anger I agree with you there's big difference\nIf I get angry and I start fighting back it's shown as a strikes like wow he's not taking the land out but if you're doing all of a sudden you're wildly emotional ... wrong with you so I think when it comes to being angry there's different with crying I don't think so I Would\nVenture to guess that if if a if a male in our office\nWas crying and it would be looked at is even a bigger sign of weakness than if one of the female workers here\nI think we're all criticized for that but I also think that women have been socialized so they can't say and here would be the most direct thing for all of us to say in these situations I Am angry shortening and I stayed and not say you're an idiot but just say I am angry\nAbsolutely yeah and and not you have made me angry 'cause again that's\n... that's like I Am angry I don't like to situate sure and I have even heard than Abbas say I'm not happy with it but we'll move on after she had a great that is a great way to express their anger\nAnd from a boss especially that's how it should go down because they're ultimately in control so they should you know be having more ice statements but even the the workers who of course you know the page exercise a lot of them had color Terry total recall is back I think Terry just a up perhaps Terry got angry oriented Terry cry which please call us back\nOne of our tax just as I Believe kind of workers on professional and I am a woman it has happened once or twice to me but I went to the restroom to compose myself and also matters where you work when I worked at an animal shelter which has mostly women and uh and gay men\nAnd there's so much emotion ... and how people are cruel to animals that it was considered appropriate and acceptable to cry it where I imagine tried at work off and\nI imagine that a lot of hospitals in hospice care there's a lot of years and all the time because you're in a very highly charged emotional situation same thing with with rescue shelters and and even ... any anything to do with with medical field I bought an imagined what have you know\nAlthough and I know covering the news for decades police officers and firefighters or try to do their job and remains still ac but whenever it would involve a child that was not unusual to see first responders do their job to cry on the job\nAnd that that makes total sense are they going to business office when you're in the land of cubicles it's a little different and perhaps this article hit me the wrong way because I've unfortunately been in a situation a at a different place of business where I had a coworker\nOr come down so hard on another coworker of mine that this gentleman made this young lady cry and I thought that should never happen you should never be driven to tears and of course she was looked at it as hey pull it together but I Know you are in the wrong here surfer even pushing this that
