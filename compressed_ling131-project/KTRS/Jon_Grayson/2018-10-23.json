have told you we recently had a couple of handwritten now we moved to this high rise built in the seventies so big kitchens big open kitchens weren't in then so we had these two little closets and designer and shake came we called one the fat pantry and when the skinny pantry and Jennifer it's amazing that\nThey are amazing I saw the design I haven't been to your house so I haven't found them ended on products but Amy brought the designs in of these two spaces and like you said so many older homes especially in St Louis have really odd shade and it's really just all over the house they can be under the ease a lot of people in\nIn kitchens especially a lot of times you'll have a pantry that's either under the stairwell going to the second floor or above the stairwell go into the basement\nRight in ours I guess you call the galley kitchen you know it's just long break any ... like a lot of people could eat in there but one thing that we have to do before you know Amy shaped as I did and then before mark came to pull everything out we had to take everything out of the two little pantries why\nDid I have Fifteen cans of sweet and condense and I do like the line from the\nTime my heart it's like who bought the right because I couldn't see\nIt I look back and for my notes we talked about pantries and John you have a pantry with why her shelves we talked about pantries about six months ago and\nEven the hyper organized clients that we have find stuff in there pantries that really has no business being in the patches we we really we keep buying the same thing right when I go to the store I keep buying the same things and all of a sudden wait wait I've got seven bottles of barbecue sauce why do I keep buying\nWhy do we end the coolest pullout juror is where all the

G. I. alternatives after the top of the hour is a pot if you've heard McGraw talking some about this this morning as well there are several of\nAcross the country marijuana initiatives on ballots including here in Missouri\nAnd or the state of Illinois just made some movies on the medical pot front as well but now we have recreational we'd have a little across Canada anybody who wants to buy marijuana can just walk up to the dispensary and buy some and\nUse it for whatever reason they wish and there's a little bit of a problem because it seems you know for the uh\nThey didn't account for demand well\nI I have heard people talk about that and also that there is a worry now that obviously it will be regulated so you would think that would be a good thing right but the unregulated pot dealers might try to under cut the regulated winds and so that presents a problem\nRight because they will be able to sell it without taxes presumably you know they're not going to report that didn't come to the government so\nYou might not be sure of what you were getting\nExactly but then for years we haven't really been true what would you were getting in terms of you know buying pot from a dealer because I I remember seeing stories on the news about how are they would transport this stuff in giant you know kilos inside the diesel tanks on a semi tractor trailers\nShow you know it's sitting there and granted it's wrapped up\nBut still you don't know where that stuff's been hanging ever did show it's a much better situation that have the regulated pot shops like they do in Canada if they can keep the supply of the show\nAnd I was thinking it helps farmers but is it ...\nOr it can be but either way I Need to grow outside just about anywhere to write so it might help farmers right um so in the state of Missouri it might help farmers would also help at second hand because once pot is legal and it will be see this is this is the thing that drives me a little crazy about this entire thing\nIt's going to happen what what what the situation is now in Colorado and California and Alaska and all of that will be the situation nationwide it will be legal and available for every body where every over the age of Twenty one or whatever who wants to smoke will be able to legally smoke or eat or whatever and then make it\nLegal for everybody over sixty [laughter] at all of the younger people like all the hippies get the smoke\nWell you know any body or slow anybody who's in prison for a pot related offense should be free\nAnd where they won't be though and ... and that you're right and that's another ridiculous piece of this but ah why we're doing this in fits and starts why we didn't do just do what candidate did and said fine he won't we'd go go Smokey bring whatever you want a it doesn't make any sense\nAnd you know ... what my concern is is okay if you have and we'll ask the guise of aid shelter a GI alternatives about this after the top of the hour if you have a situation like Illinois does\nOr medical marijuana is legal but recreational isn't what happens when they make that switch to the dispensaries just switch it open their doors and say anybody can come in or will drive the medical dispensaries out of business first when you have competition with them ... show and all kinds of questions need to be answered about this one\nOf our tax church says I'm all for recreational lead for adults satisfy less damaging and alcohol which has destroyed countless lead it does seem that people who are high on we don't get aggressive right and they don't drive like ...\nWill you brought up a good point a few minutes ago that we really don't know there's always been a suspicion that if it were legal many more people would use than do now and I'm Wondering that's a good thing or a bad thing again they\nSome people think it's a thing some people think it's a gateway drug to other people denied\nIt isn't a I'm One of the ones who thinks it is not and so the the uh we'll get what candidates experiment will now show\nIs whether those numbers are significant you know if it goes up from ... twenty percent of the population to forty percent of the population what will that mean will it go up that high because I'm not convinced at all that there were people now who want to smoke pot and don't simply because it's illegal you know I don't think those guys exist I think\nAll of us had a friend in either a high school or college\nAnd some of those friends smoke pot and some of them didn't write and I don't think that that ratio would be different if it were legal because it pretty much was legal meaning everybody could have gotten that if they wanted it and the people who wouldn't smoke wouldn't smoke now\nRight I mean if it was legal tomorrow I think those people still wouldn't go to the seven eleven it's just like cigarettes ... cigarettes are legal and there's people who will never smoke a cigarette I've\nSeen that I've seen first hand the damage that is done by drugs like cocaine and heroin yeah first hand if it were legal tomorrow and I could go to the drugstore by cocaine and heroin is not a chance that I never in a million years would do that I'd\nLook at opioids right I mean and those are killing people and any doctor can prescribe done right and then they do\nAnd that's how most of the addiction starches that somebody's prescribed it for a legitimate reason and they find they can't stop [noise] we'll go to Jeff and find out what he's got for us hey Jeff how you doing\nJohn Jennifer ... what I was younger\nJennifer max uh when when I was younger I used to drink soda rather than a doctor\nOr which is all it does yeah it's good stuff\nGood stuff that kind of a heart of legalization of marijuana I agree with you just do it just\nGot to get it get it over with and people smoke and and eat it or [laughter] right yeah\nAnd and I find that some of the byproduct of some of the other part of a ... my wife could give it to other parts of the platform on for her to the\nWhole kind of a seizure disorders yeah\nYup the other thing is I was going to call your wife had her on her and Jennifer you got a you've got a lot of the stuff in your house yes\nYeah it definitely we we we live out here in St Charles now and we are encouraged 'em and Andrea much room whether or not the same petri\nI Know it's amazing are you a better cook is yet to read\nIt [laughter] I'm banking on\nSo we bought an of the ... but I don't know if I'm going to you I I I don't know that\nThere would change the way a cook special on [laughter] thanks yes okay I have a I I Love my instant ... no doubt ah but yeah when when it comes to you know the comparisons to things that are legal ah I I don't know if that's the best way to make the decision to say well alcohol is damaging and it's legal so why not this\nSo I Wonder if bakeries would just have one part of their bakery that had to edibles or just new bakeries would

consulting company in a so as you know part of that ah when the legislation was getting ready to be passed\nA lot of the cannabis guys recalling looking for somebody to help right policies and procedures and\nWhich is kind of funny because when I left before I left law enforcement I was actually opposing you know the medical cannabis bills on my God this is an ... or so but ah I like to tell people that despite my efforts the law passed\nA but I also like to think because of not just mind but law enforcement efforts in general Illinois changed that law\nA and made it very tightly crafted so that when when it was passed and rolled out and in Illinois I think has done a very very good job\nFrom ... regulatory component of getting this a rolled out and so I'm so kind of reluctantly I did sign on to do some consulting and ah couldn't get along with many of the guys I dealt with in a but when I met with a group from age CIA how central\nUm they are very like minded with me that hey we were we all have interest in other companies and we don't want to get in trouble and we want to make sure that one we have a successful business model but we don't want to get in trouble and can you help us write policies and procedures and\nSo I did a still with the understanding I thought that I Would probably go do something else [noise]\nIt out at a ... question for you and somebody wants to now are you worried about federal law and what happens when somebody read just to ensure marijuana at the state of Illinois I did they lose their right to own firearms\nAre so no I'm not necessarily worried about a federal law [noise]\nUh I think at some point you're probably seen a next to know more than five years you'll see a complete federal schedule changed so that ... e a a I Know they're actively adding meetings because when the\nFDA approved last drug that came out that it is a direct to rebut of cannabis ah for epileptic seizures\nOr they move that particular one to schedule for Jeff Sessions hate you they'll be a guy area alive for sure no doubt about it uh but through the Rohrabacher amendment they pretty much there there is no big bad wolf so Jeff Sessions or despite what he would like to do to the industry\nIs limited because a rocker amendment says that the federal government cannot spin federal monies to investigate or prosecute\nState sanctioned medical cannabis programs it doesn't protect a recreational and that robot ... has passed and the budget for the last eight years the likelihood of that changing and now you have\nThirty three thirty one stage right now that habit do you have thirty three states you can you can ratify the amendment and change it\nOr through a simple vote so it's getting closer and closer that federal schedule changes and quite frankly if you look at all of the issues that the federal government has to worry about right now with border control and all the issues and can\nA state regulated in a way it should not rise to that so\nUh I don't I I'm not worried about them at all and then the second part of that question in a in Illinois if you do get a a a can of his car due to not lose your a void privileges which your firearm owner identification privileges or your concealed carry permit just because those two\nAre state sanctioned programs so you can't have one state sanctioned program in conflict with another state sanction programs so or know their their firearms will be safe\nAnd it's the it's interesting to note at Dana Rohrabacher the guy behind that ... is best friends with ... from the Dewey brothers I don't know how many people out there but yeah so I think we should just call it the skunk factor [laughter]\nDown there I didn't know that fascinating stuff it really is and and if if people want more information about ac I about what you do where where can they find the online are and how can people get more information if they live in the state of Illinois about how to qualify for the Canada's program is a\nQualifying conditions they can go to the Illinois department of public health all the conditions are listed on there and kind of how to uh we have a website if they want to look at how central specifically\nAh they go to my new meds dot com or hates the Illinois dot com that that will take us through the same link or all the qualifying conditions are listed there as well there's a how do I get a card tabs so\nLing uh all the qualifying conditions are listed there as well there was a how do I get a card tabs so uh we can help them navigate through the process and and if they if they still have\nA problems with it to some people do they can they can stop in a store they they can't come all the way into the store because you have to have a card but if the they certainly coming are lobbying we can we can help walk them through that process\nSo Scott just your personal opinion John has been staying and we've been talking about this morning that a marijuana will probably become legal in so many states agree and do you think that's okay\nAh yeah so I think you have to uh you know the the cop and mean usually the knee jerk ... says you know it's one more drug but you know at the end of the day up to ask a question you know does prohibition work\nUh I don't believe it does it never has a people that want to get cannabis on the street they are getting it\nUh in but the concern is that they never know what they're getting there are always subject to violence um and so if you can regulate it and you can keep the tax base down because the problem is most states when they passed a recreation like you know what this is a windfall for us we're going to put a thirty two percent tax on it\nBut what does it creates that the the regulated market is so expensive it's cheaper to buy it on the street and so you've not had an impact on the list that drug sales were black market so\nAs long as states pass them wisely and they do a regulatory process where you can absolutely you know you can you know from the ... century so I keep it out of hand and and do investigations like we do any alcohol industry making sure we're not so into kids\nUm that as long as they do that and they keep the tax base right you absolutely can have an impact on the illicit market in in and make a difference as to raise some tax money so it I think is going to happen so it's just up to legislators to roll it out the right way\nMy new ... dot com check it out and Scott Abbott chief operating officer for ... thank you so much for coming by again and ah just just

either\nWay what on earth\nWould you deal with all that money I worry you know I interviewed lottery winners and read books that they've written about how\nThey get death threats in their family members hate them down and the girls that he would give the thousand dollars to Kelly Jackson and I felt mad at him why nine hundred million dollars and he's only giving out how to Kelly like walking around with them you got to give it or nothing I Know it's fifty thousand that she doesn't have and I worried about this all the way to work\n[laughter] I Love her to have you back to what\nI yeah I

for a reason she had she had done something to help out a family member and that family member when they passed away [noise] less money to my sister and\nThey they were worried they were like should we tell John ... sister got this and I was like oh good for you I mean of course it wasn't wasn't mine to begin with and she didn't take anything away from me so\nAsk any lawyer John Boehner leads fight about that is that\nI Am not disputed I understand it happens all the time I just think it's ridiculous when people fight over this stuff\nAnd that's what happens at like one point six billion dollars or whatever right at least the experts are telling people if you win the lottery secured the ticket don't tell anyone get a lawyer get a financial person don't tell anyone\nAt first I don't tell anyone I always say\nI I Know my first call would be and it's to a friend of mine who runs the security firm and I would say you know what I'm freaking out right now grab your team and get up here I don't care what it costs I'll tell you why when you give\nYour I also read somebody said you shouldn't sign the tickets so that a lawyer can create a blind trust for you and I had not heard that before\nThat I had not either but ... the lottery officials tell you the exact opposite they sign it right away because the courage right somebody else can claim it as their sole not\nTelling anyone I mean don't they publish her name don't they have I mean\nDuring the day it it yeah yeah I think Ninety Days to turn it in\nIn Missouri You have no right to privacy correct that\nRight well let's say you had an attorney who created a blind trust mhm like take Gary spy beach\n[laughter] whenever you want your name is Gary via video sign\nIt with a trusted name than they might not know you who wouldn't the public is if you created a blind trust I Know you don't sign the ticket and it's like a\n'cause what match that is true you eventually have to turn in the ticket and you can't do it you can't turn the ticket in in the name of a trust you have to do it as an individual and if and when you do the lottery part of a deal is they have the right to your image and ah your your used in promotional material\nSo by the time and wonder is is a lawyer creates a trustee for you like John Smith trustee\nAnd his name is on the ticket then he gets the money well\nI I heard [laughter] and your money ... [laughter]\nAh yeah I Know I Do worry about I Would not monkey with this system I you know you just go with it if if if it that much money by an island somewhere just leave\nThis is funny attacks just as I just read that if you win the first thing you should do is call everyone you know and tell them you have a huge hard and you need to borrow two hundred dollars [laughter] oh that's nice if you sign you take it yes you are required to be publicly announced but if you don't you don't win riot\nRight correct uh so yeah I mean you don't have to take the money you could just sit there and burn your winning ticket if you want to do but if you do there are consequences and and this is one of the things that are you there was a a great rundown ABC News or from other network here or did a terrific rundown Amish of past winners\nWhose lives were ruined by massive jackpots and they were not just talking about people who had the annoyance of having friends and family are after them for money all the time we all understand that goes with it but most of them were dead within three years", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "23"}
