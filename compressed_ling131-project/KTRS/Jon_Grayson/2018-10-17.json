are talking about\nWell thank you so much for calling Mali we really appreciate it October is breast cancer awareness month and we're doing our part ... latest information on fighting this disease Dr Theresa Schwartz is a surgeon at SSN help St Louis university hospital in health St Mary's hospital and joins us on line ... good luck to you again\nYeah good afternoon thanks for having me\nSo tell us about this new technology called may get seed what is the ...\nYeah they just want to improve that in my opinion from a surgical point for treating them like breast cancer that we had any in decades how we can make a lot of strike and radiation treatments that this is why it at first\nDecades we do make a lot of strides in chemotherapy and radiation treatments that this was one of the first big blizzard made into a surgical management of breast cancer in a long time\nTo what we're what we were pretty if we needed to do whatever women would have to get part of the breast removed for something that we couldn't feel we had to put a wire into the breast on the day of their operation show they would check into the hospital get wield over to breast imaging\nHave a wire placed into the breath using a mammogram to guide it and why are actually came out of the skin and then we use that as a guide to find these areas that we couldn't see her feel that now this new vaccine technology it's a tiny magnetic seed that's about the size of a grain of rice\nGets placed into the breast on Sunday prior to the operation that can be anywhere up to a year before the operation\nUm needs to happen but it goes right next door to the ... located and then we have a probe and operating room that except that magnetic signal she'll she'll just white where we need to go without having a a wire sticking out of the breast or an extra procedure on the day the operation\nWell jumped to George how do you get that Meg seed into depressed and is that painful it\nIt's not painful it's actually similar to the process but the patients would go through to have the biopsy done in the first place\nShow the skin is down death and then a needle that has the seed inside of it goes into the breast under ultrasound guidance or under ... guidance and shows and exactly where the abnormality is located and then to see just comes right out so it's it's actually less traumatic when they're additional biopsy one\nSo we're the patient not having the traditional wires is grudging opposite effect you surgeon it\nAffects us in a lot of ways to number one it it definitely makes the Airflow on the day of an operation so much more smoothly because before what if for whatever reason a wire couldn't get in at the time it was scheduled or it took longer to place than we thought\nOperations can push back whenever we can't do things on it on a certain time line and also with without having to wire sticking out on the patients are markedly less anxious I mean that is that's pretty scary to have a whole bunch of guys on your chest wall\n'em knowing that you have a wire there that's basically marking the cancer\nBut also during the operation that feed is not going to move I Know it's not going anywhere that wire that was placed canvas it can move inside the breast tissue we can even be accidentally pulled out in transit\nChanges that game completely so that seed being implanted in Nebraska right next to the abnormality I Know that it's not going to get bumped I Know that it's not going to be\nA dislodged from exactly where we need to be for the operation so it helped guide where I Need to do with a little more certainly\nSo doctors words I read that flew hospital was the first in our region to have this do other hospitals haven't yet\nYeah we were the first ones in the region but now it there are several other hospitals in town including all of the s M hospitals that should be getting at the very near future as well as the barns hospitals or the Washington University hospitals so that should be coming down the pipeline pretty soon\nCan you also tell us about three D. breast biopsy machine what you've done and what should women know about it\nYeah it's a it's a great technology for a radiologist to use because we've all we all jumped onto the three D. mammograms\nPretty quickly enough greedy mammograms different from the traditional way on the ground and that it it actually makes one millimeter slices of breast tissue on on the end the genetic gets put together so you can scroll through their breath kind of like an accordion\nAnd and get a much more exact a picture of the breast but unfortunately we were picking up things with a three D. mammograms that we weren't able to see on a Tuesday mammogram and we didn't have a way to buy up see those are the way that our three D. biopsy machine helps is that if there's an abnormality that we can't see on ultrasound\nAnd we can't see an standard mammogram\nAnd we can only see it on that three D. mammogram are three D. biopsy machine that flew allows us to visualize that he'd be able to buy up to the area and question\nStill for most women doctors weren't standard ... what they should get\nLike a regular mammograms or ...\nYeah and you know for the most part um I'd say most women would be okay getting at a committee mammograms that as as a radiologist get more comfortable with reading ... and they're able to\nReally fairly have any call back so the number of women have to come back after an abnormal three D. mammogram as much lower than what we were saying ... if you have the option to get a three D. ... I I really highly recommend at the level of accuracy a radiologist can place on the interpretation of your mammogram", "show_name": "Jon Grayson", "year": "2018", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "17"}
