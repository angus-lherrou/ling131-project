that has happened this weekend so far what a wild Saturday in college football [noise] we'll talk about it with our Richards and Ben Fredrickson this hour Jim Thomas on the blues big bounce back last night against the Blackhawks down\nAt enterprise center but we start with moves you of course the big five fifty Katie are as your whole for the tigers and it all worked\nFor all intents and purposes that stereotype was going to pick up his first win against a ranked opponent November twelve Kentucky yesterday at for oh field in Colombia the Wildcats seemingly help bliss on all since\nThey're start running back and quite frankly I think is overrated Betty Snell held in check\nBy the Missouri defense in fact you looked out at the stat sheet and see the Benny Snell at Nineteen carries for sixty eight yards\nI told you that yesterday I told you that twenty four hours ago snails going to have Nineteen carries for sixty eight yards you would ask how much is ... going to win by two touchdowns\nTouchdowns maybe this is exactly what they saw this is why they get shed ... who was a touchdown favor with zero FCC wins\nAgainst one of the best defenses in the country the number twelve ranked team this rarely happens biggest doesn't put lines out like that against teams can\nBiggest doesn't put lines out like that\nAgainst teams like Kentucky and when your team is ... having that

[noise]\nWe are steep idiots driving spiral bitterness over thirty three fourths of the forty running around the block\n\nFive yards while [noise]\nEither for the [noise]\nWhat do we say about special the themes turnovers they've got a lot of fun and they've got to turn it on nothing on Labor Day and the game of at the press like\nKelly Howard Richards Christian venal on the tiger radio network here the big five fifty yesterday afternoon that's exactly right Kentucky doing nothing on off switch scene in the game via special teams and that was\nTheir first possession since they had elected\nTo go forward on fourth down inside the inside the ten yard line of the tigers elected no field goal they go for it they didn't pick it up here thinking wow what a missed opportunity for Kentucky this game would\nBe tied if they had decided let's let's go ahead and the let's kick the field goal which scored a touchdown suddenly it's a completely different ball game but\nThat's not the way it was drawn up our shouldn't say it would have been ... but it it it it would have completely altered the set up all the games here thinking wow\nWhat a what may be a botched call there by coach soups in the wild cats but they would\nIndeed prove otherwise and get the ball back yet again and let's be clear\nThis was a nother disappointing effort by them as often as they say you know forget about the Kentucky defense for a second to the Kentucky and even just been fine\nGame was the most important thing right now don't think it's over you know as a\nMatter of this for a while we have a lot of stuff to build and build on and\nYou know it's on off again like I told her today they're going to end up with a hundred percent oh there and\nSo we can you know want to know [noise]\nYou know
