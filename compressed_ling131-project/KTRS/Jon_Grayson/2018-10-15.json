shell should you get fired from your job for something you did in your personal life\nAnd maybe heard about this story a woman was fired after there was cell phone video of her blocking demand from entering the downtown loft where she left and he left\nHim a girl was talking about this running up to the show the show today and they were I don't know if they match do they get into the fact that she was\nFire I don't believe so they're more about is it ever OK to questions you know if somebody who lives in your neighborhood or lives in your building you know is that okay and I think that\nYou know it was not the right question to ask because this woman didn't say oh I've not seen either before my name's Sally how are you which we shouldn't do that she was blocking his entrance and basically being very rude to him so there's there would've been a nice way for her to introduce yourself and to find that if you live there that's not what she did\nAnd you can see this video camera will be has had on its website but the woman was fired from her job from her day\nJob from her job in here and this happened over the weekend and uh\nI I why did you watch the video I watched I watched it this morning yeah um I mean I've got a couple of questions for the guy in the video\nIf she worked for you Josh would you want to retain her as an employee [noise]\nSee that's that's tough let's do that you you were you were in Josh is dry cleaning service and it's a really popular dry cleaning service and she was your main\nYour main rap and so she's there and so she's the face of your company people come in handy to drop off my dry cleaning adjusted ... then they see her and go argue that person from the video you would wouldn't you want to let her go there\nI don't I don't think that this woman's life needs to be ruined it or not it's a job doing away with those or somebody's life uh but she's got to have to you know in a hit the ground and then find a job she has you know\nZero notice of her job going away I don't know what they're offering these sort of separates or or whatever but I'm with you it would taint the office place it would taint her employment there we know\nWhat you did and and you made national\nI mean if she was more tension across the whole here are dead drunk and fish and Jews or waitress you as the owner of drunk and fish you'd have to say I don't know if you can work you know you give her a job recommendation for her next job\nUh you know what possibly you do because if she was fine at her job you say look we had to let her go because of all this stuff I mean you're after it really does care but yeah I Know what else would I Would absolutely give her recommendation sure but I think that as a boss it makes sense to me that you can't retain somebody who's made national viral video and you get something like this\nThis woman worked at ... ... S T L\nAnd they put a statement out try that could ask was\nRecently shared a video containing a disturbing interaction that we believe it's important to clarify that video did involve one of our employees but the event did not take place at ... ... did not involve one of our tenants to video showing the employee in her private life\nAt her own residence interacting with another person that tried to scale family as a minority owned company that consist of employees and residents from many racial backgrounds we're proud of the stack them do not and never will stand for racism or racial profiling at our company\nAfter a view of the matter the employee has been terminated and it's no longer with our company at tried that can S T eh we want all residents gas and visitors to feel welcome safe and respect it\nI mean it really tried to enter the building with African American and the woman trying to stop him was white\nIt definitely seems like it was racial profiling but to this guy who was filming all of this I mean I I don't know what it's like okay I'm a I'm a white male and I've never had any sort of um\nYou know discrimination against me right you know people are handy me jobs I'm inviting me into their buildings um but I'm sure it's frustrating to have lived a whole life with little things here and there like that\nBut if he would've just showing his key fob to get into the door for a lot of this would have happened did show her she said repeatedly show me your keep up and he so I don't\nHave to show which was ... when she said what apartment do you live in and she doesn't have it I don't have to not only does it doesn't\nRead but I Will say this no matter what company you work for I mean I've always worked for in public jobs the company says you represent our company whether you're on duty or offshore\nAnd then that makes sense are contracts or you know our employment can be avoided if we ever act in a way in our personal life that does not reflect the company's value\nBut Josh is disturbing to say\nA personal life that does not reflect the company's value\nBut Josh is disturbing to say he could have made the situation go away if he would have just done what the person who was racially profiling amassed stature the onus is not on him\nTo to do anything for her at all he is a private citizen she lived in that building he was coming home from a long day at work and if I'm coming home to my house and there's somebody said to me have proved to me the live here I don't have to do that I'm tired I came home from work leave me alone crazy lady\nBut maybe I'm a passive aggressive ah and maybe I'm you know non confrontational but your show your key fob you tell this crazy lady what apartment you live and and then you complain to to the the property manager at the next day\nWell and the gentleman involved in this story went was interviewed and said he didn't want her to get fired and he didn't want people going after her he himself would like to have a conversation with her one of our cats are said if she was black and he was light would that change the outcome\nI doubt that that would happen I just thought that that would happen and we did we don't hear stories like that mhm\n[noise] yeah that's true I mean we we we we don't hear stories about a black person saying hey white person do you actually live here in this neighborhood it doesn't happen but for some reason a lot of white people feel like well I don't know if a black person can live in the neighborhood does this happen for decades and decades and decades\nOr just the fact of the fact of the matter that's why we keep hearing stories like this and I can guarantee you for this gentleman is not the first time that you that this has happened to him as Josh points out with whether it's driving while black or walking down the street while black or going to your own home while being black\nAnd this gentleman said he was glad he had his cell phone video that he was taking video of it because if not it could have gone south\nYeah and she was definitely in the wrong I mean don't get me wrong she definitely did that the\nWe live in a local law

the overall ... be friendly that\nRegardless of your sexual preference I Want to go to St Louis or I Want to do the Kansas City there's things to do in places to see you know places to see and I wonder if part of that energy\nUp yeah so absolutely the more people coming to marry or as far as the economic impact of it or you know especially in the case of where cities St Louis being one of the number or you're tending to lose populations if not right outside of the city at least into the suburbs\nUh yeah absolutely the more people who move here the more the merrier and the thing about an influx of people again regardless of sexual preference as you get a lot of new ideas and a lot of people trying different things and I think that ... says the city\nAnd that that's I think uh the the best part of that\nWhat integration into the city is as we get a lot of new and different ideas are not all of them are going to work but some of them will and you have people who are happy to be here I guess that's the other thing too is when I\nSee a young people are moving into St Louis they seemed genuinely excited about being here and that's nice because you know we're older veterans can be yeah I live in the city so it's nice for someone that's especially people from small communities we've all heard at ourselves when people will say\nCouldn't stand the small town anymore or what have you that wanted to move to the big city and St Louis is your big city welcome\nYou know we talk a lot about the businesses opening but also every once in a we have to talk about a famous places closing in coffee cartel has announced that tomorrow he's their last day in business is I Know when I was in my mid twenties wasn't staple I used to go to ... all the time and um\nI guess the dealer which is the last couple of years it's been down as far as people coming to buy a couple of jokes\nAnd that was never on my ... but you are younger than I Am this is true so you know and you're a jerk for that\nSo uh uh but\nUh yeah you know I think the other thing too is I guess it was not not just the big chain Starbucks is a monolithic type of coffee place\nBut there are so many places smaller our local or local chains if you will and single store coffee shops that are opening up the ... you know at some point something has to shake out\nAnd and I think certainly was coffee I mean I Know copies all of those items to me there's a few same way probably maybe it has to do with liquids [laughter]\nBut um I tend to avoid chain places like that not because there's anything wrong with them it's just that would rather go find that one place where there's one owner or family or a couple who are trying to make it go in that spot and now it's kind of art and not find a coffee place somewhere\nYeah but generally are a lot of building has been going down in that area a just a block away and new building opened up and more people are in the west in ... you would think that more people would be getting coffee in the mornings uh well\nUm apparently not or I Would imagine coffee cartel would stay open\nYeah I mean it's going to prove\nProve it in the pudding or the whatever the reasons why there is supposed to stay open clearly their accountants and folks looked at it and said time to close the doors\nSo it's a great location though with a great patio opportunity and I'm sure many great location restaurant as soon as next set up I'm\nImagining remaining vacant for a long\nYou are you also wrote an article about how well we get great March when it comes to the L GBDs

really great march that was in green space Parkland in and we still do that is one of the things that I guess kept us out of Ninety nine thirty one hundred on that list\nUm but yeah we we do not a
