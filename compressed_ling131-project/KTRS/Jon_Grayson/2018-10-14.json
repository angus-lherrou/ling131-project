I'm going to hit four inches by in about eight pounds say the same thing if you ask interpret how far you have to buy it and he says an inch or do they actually it's four inches by annabelle with a shallow swim leg you're not in danger of hitting the ball first or\nOr even checking it and so it's going to be a shower swaying it's going to be this even want to have that ball right and then I liked that David\nThat ball set a great and that David and uh and and it's all about swing force that are going to have the same day that every time I'm very this the slightly open face to help keep the club from digging but I'd be closer to get her method on that without without a lot of extreme outside in type set up an action\nI I I tried different ones I I kind of agreed hired that's a good way of putting it higher degree of difficulty you can do it but it's just going to take a lot more practice was\nUm you you and I talk the other day and I ... I found it interesting and fascinating ... in fact I brought it up that night talking to the gym Randolph you know the the ... and I said you certainly\nAren't credited necessarily with strokes gain putting the statistic but you were doing it before they actually came out with this is the statistic I Would you please elaborate on that staff and exactly what it does in why you did it before it actually became is that\nYeah I I never have claimed that I guess John eight and a little battles coach pat dust credited me with within the ending but gained ... and ... and again I don't say it but this was the fats were there I just started using about Twenty years ago and all it gained is confusing and most people here is what it is basically a seven foot out on the first ...\nUh the ... make half of those\nSo the number of ... they take is one point five that makes sense to most people if I make that seven butter and now I Am now half of the head of the tour average for that round so on and on it goes if you have a thirty five but but they average to point the robot so obviously if you're too but you said even if you made it picked up a whole stroke\nSo what I'm trying to do every round the golf I play as beat the tour average and and that's what it is on the pet scan that's why Jason Day obviously as is gaining a probably a stroke around a stroke and a half around almost on on the guys\nSo that's six seven strokes than a tournament but that's what puts gained is basically it was there with the tourist ads but now they've kind of perfect didn't even have a stroke scan for driving that far away and strokes around the green\nWhat are you working on right now I mean 'cause I Know you just don't sit still and I know you give lessons you do things in fact I found in the credit in the back of your book I thought Donald Trump has the credit which I thought was interesting I Know you've worked overdue ... what are what are you working on now to get better on the actually teach better as well\n[laughter] well I I think the main thing that continue to do but I did change my lower teams up here because we'll get bored with them is is I keep score in practice and or a ... and speaking of Trump I played with and probably a dozen times so I may be the next secretary of state or something like that forever\nThough I may be ambassador to the to eighty or something to be better [laughter]\nBut um uh he he didn't have a very good budding stroke but he thinks he's a great punter and if I didn't know that before\nYou probably as a partner you want the guy who would think the the great butter\nMore than the guy with a good stroke he thinks he's a bad butter it's amazing I mean at at putting so much about edited\nBut I'm I'm always working on a shot I made up a

can really play some golf\nIt's a it's hard to play bad anyway and I think that's what you said the other day I don't necessarily help people play may may be really a lot better but they don't please you know they take the game and it's not as bad and it sounds crazy to see that but that actually makes you way better than a more consistent golfer\nYeah yeah it it's a game of methods and certainly

game per plane is one thousand one thousand NFL game online NHL\nGame all with a was Chicago anyway here saps the path and that type of tying up the triangle and and get one play doesn't make a game\nBox that play kind of typified and one of the things that that sets that's wrong with the blues they're\nThey're just not playing smart and that they're trying to find that balance between being more aggressive on off as they have all this talent at forward and they're they're starting to you know so it's the first day and they produce pretty well off offensively but eve you've ... you've still got to be mindful of you know time and circumstance\nAnd uh you still got to play defense and and uh those things are are are lacking wherever\nYou know you know being in really in any sport being aggression is good going one step too far in losing short of a uh\nWho you are whether it's defensively or just you know any other um a basic to the game and that's that's what it is one step too far when you lose those things that really was your core values\nYeah and his team it strikes me in and I think Mike yo agreed there still I don't think they know what their identity is they're still looking for their identity I think they want her\nThey want to be a little bit more up tempo team and a fast paced Jane and all kinds of oriented ... blues came in at least in recent vintage ah ah they've always been if not locked down to five probably pretty good defense I think we mentioned on the big blue show how what sticks to the past seven years they've been seven\nAre better in terms of Jewish goals allowed and fight now Seventeen goals in in four games up at four four and a quarter of goals uh again and that that's just a that's just not going to cut it\nKnew it was not and um we mentioned Judy gallon in in my view I wanted to get your thoughts my view was the last two games he's been at ... at the very least solid maybe better\nYeah I think a a although his ... his numbers are good I mean are there ... there there are bad I I think it's over four goals again yeah\nAllow for him I think is the quality of his play hasn't been reflected in the overall scheme resolved I mean he he was she was\nWas married yet he was very good last night as a career high for him for saves forty six shades and you know I I I haven't crunched the numbers here\nBut I plan to release it I mean that the blues are just are giving up punched the shops I mean and and that's another thing they've always been near to the top elite when she was shops alive so yeah it looks like he's tracking

plenty of a a big stage last night but uh and and really they probably don't get a point without them for the first I don't know period and a half maybe almost to carry it looked almost like the blues

whether or not she's me whether or not he's actually scoring goals I liked the way he seems to be in control on the ice and you know we talk about some time to be too aggressive\nNow I think it's a
