I think we're gonna take our first break we'll come back we're going to talk a little bit about some rock stars that I visited this week\nAnd we're talking about double rock stars healthcare rock stars as well as financial rock stars will be back right after these messages [noise]\nNow is one small change can make a big difference if you're not happy with your current Medicare coverage to take a look at Coventry healthier they have a wide range of plans with great service and clear cross\nLooting medical and drug coverage in one simple plan just call one eight five five three three eight nine five five one AM to eight pm seven days a week that's one eight five five three three eight nine five five on\nAn ounce of the time to call the Coventry health care [noise]\nThinks this year you may find them in those critical choices retirement game plan willing in Medicare pardon me in your Medicare is\nHow you may find that in my mind how insurance plan that that's where I got started in\n... Oregon where are you near zero zero age\nRange for free health insurance contracts or email me a bee outfit and shown [noise]\nThe greatest rock because of all time [noise] true rock star [noise]\nEverybody wants to be a rock star retirement so when they come and visit oftentimes will say\nOh you rock stars want to find out if we are well a lot of the more we do want to talk about Joan Judy today June as you are a couple of rock stars and waiting to happen to visit with this week\nAnd Joe happens to be sixty four years old and he works for a small manufacturing from here in the city or his wife's Judy is in HR assistant which is always fun\nI'm at a local one of the local hospitals today I'm Joe would like to retire at the end of this year and Judy says okay\nToday I'm Joe would like to retire at the end of this year\nAnd Judy says okay it's cool but I'm not leaving you want to go by three more years Judy sixty two so [noise] she wants to make sure that there's no issues with health care and says you can easily transition to Medicare sixty five so she wants to work two or Medicare algebra date [noise]\nAnd what's nice is is that they've been terrific savers and investors are between them they have about a million one in retirement assets inside of four three B plans as well as four one K. plants and they have about another hundred thousand dollars in savings\nAnd so what's needed is is that um join Judy provide a lot of different planning options an opportunity to have a lot of questions and so we're and go through these today\nTo start with um we talk about rock stars one of the really important components that I Know one of the ones that creates the most amount of [noise]\nI don't know what you want to call their people will scared maybe a little bit of animosity is that um [noise]\nIs healthcare transition in Joe did have some questions and you know so we're going to dedicate this particular portion of the segment to are very good friends come and tree healthcare Missouri and at that company for sponsoring are smart choices about your health care\nAnd jets question was simple it's one that I Know here and here's almost every single day which is\nYou know Joe sixty four he's getting ready to turn sixty five and just a couple of months do I have to enroll in Medicare part B when I turned sixty five if I'm covered by Judy's health insurance and actually he's asking this because his living room is halfway filled up with paper and information has been getting for Medicare as well as other companies wanted to sell them stuff\nBecause they want to get there\nAt that moment of truth to make sure that he can transition Medicare but the truth is job you'll have to\nWhat I've learned from your and is that if you are covered\nBy a credible health plans and employer based coverage is considered credible health plan you don't have to enroll in Medicare and as a matter of fact I'm he also has to have to contact Medicare to have to respond to their request of what's going on in the answer's no Medicare knows zero you'll be old enough to enroll but you don't have to\nAnd by the way there is no penalty to you regardless of what your friends or do you use for it's happened to say rather water cooler\nAbout him really Medicare and sixty five because if you are covered by another health care plan credible coverage you can stay on that plan don't after all part B until the time you decide to leave that plant\n... or in his case a things work out correctly Joel leave or Judy south playing when she leaves her health plans she'll be sixty five and in that time he'll be between sixty seven sixty eight\nIs other questions what's the process if I Do weight to enroll in Medicare when Judy retires well we'll talk about that in a minute but really what we do is at this point we sort of have won flashpoint here okay chose question is should I stay on my wife's plant\nWhich happens to be decent coverage or should I go to Medicare which is we know is having because Medicare is really frankly better coverage than with your supplements better coverage than you're happy user no doctor was which is right or for that\nSo one of the things here and does that she'll get a copy of your current plan description she'll take a look at and project what your health care out of pocket expenses could be and compare that to what would happen should your own party\nAs well as do supplement key algebra component here is that we know that Judy and paying for chose coverage is doing this on a pre tax basis through her payroll under a cafeteria plan so therefore whatever she's being charged we know is going to be really reduced\nBy with all the taxes right because she's not going to pay federal or state taxes on that money son after tax pull for net pay it's actually from gross pay which is really beneficial thing for her [noise] we have to compare that to the out of pocket expense\nThat yo would have if he's enrolled in Medicare which is approximately based on their income is approximately a hundred and thirty five dollars per month today plus the cost of that supplement [noise]\nOnce that math is that in most cases where we found is many folks do stay on their spouses plan if they have an ability to do that\nIt's not a bad idea we also know that at the time due to size the leaves a plane and this could be I mean again maybe he does go three years until Judy retires but alternatively what do you explain goes up like crazier they decide to stop subsidizing maybe\nA portion of 'em\nThat premiums are doing today because it brings a law would they may consider doing is they may say okay here's what we're going to do we're going to do is we're actually going to look at the plant make those decisions and maybe they'll stay on the plane or maybe the leaves so whichever way they go they're in good shape but they do have what's called a special enrollment\nNow back to sway talking retirement on the big five fifty the IRS years yes and hairy little fetus is Jeff in your English [noise] due to the use of the\nBig apple with my dad was a fun I Know she's checking out Wall Street [noise] it'd be reporting back to death [noise]\nFor the retirement coaches were straight talker retirement or phone lines are open we love to hear from you nine six nine key T. R. S. star Katie\nLines are open we love to hear from you nine six nine key T. R. S. star Katie our estimates cell phones or one triple eight five fifty\nK. T. R. S. [noise]\nWell I guess I Would even though and fortunately no one that's listening to this one the ... ... lottery yesterday nobody won [noise] kind of go back and focus say okay what happened in the markets last week what's really going on here\nAnd I'll tell you that ah October is in many cases a time of uncertainty [noise] we're just the beginning of earning see is what drives the market generally what drives the market or geopolitical events\nPresident can drive the market through statements sometimes [noise] ah what's happening or sometimes there are hurricanes sometimes or floods\nThat occur that can move the markets but really what should move the markets and what has been moving the market's up until really this last month is earnings than the positive earnings of companies and we know that Seventy company so far of the U.S and the five hundred of but actually uh\nTalked about their earnings reported them and what's happened is is that Seventy five percent of those have beaten their earnings at is actually very income has been greater and also their bottom line is the Berlin profits have been better so\nThings are moving in the correct direction we also know that there are getting ready to talk about what GDP Growth was for the last quarter right now there's an assumption that it's running at about four percent we know the Federal Reserve and watching this is thinking to themselves maybe is one thing maybe we need to\nRaise interest rates to maybe put maybe cool this economy off a little bit of an actually our president is not happy about that and frankly no presidents are\nLow interest rates are good they're good for a couple of reasons number one is our federal government that unfortunately doesn't know how to say no to any spending bill they've ever seen can use to spend money sometimes money they don't have and fortunately for us at this point\nThe spending this borrowing is being done with very low interest money it has like insurance were Thirteen or fourteen percent which would be disastrous for the country [noise] secondly is as interest rates rise unfortunately what happens as many folks that are first time homebuyers\nFor folks that are trying to move up sometimes those interest rate paint those injuries is based on their loan can maybe take them out of the market so they feel like the housing market can slow down a little bit\nAt the same time rising interest rates means that economic activity is going and we know that it's going very well people sell their homes again which is cool you're much more fluid market [noise] ah we know that we're having we have record\nLow unemployment I mean at this moment I remember seeing this is this yesterday that we have [noise] they're like five million more job openings than there are a actually eligible workers to fill them\nWhich is fabulous at the same time we don't want them to open the gates to South America so all these people can come in and try to take these jobs not a good idea so some of uncertainty and we have the midterms coming on we just had a contentious a Supreme Court nominee go through so\nAlways lots of stuff going on and frankly there always are things that if whatever it is this week will be something else next week and uncertainty\nIs good for the Marcus because what happens is that these pull back and we've seen it in our basically very close at this point to being a ... in a true correction territory we're about ten percent of the highest really creates\nBuying opportunities it truly does\nYou feel like the U.S economy is it the greatest point highest point it will ever be in the next ten Twenty years\nShould be investing but if you don't believe that is I don't investing is great because you're buying I think the good stuff quote unquote the discount so\nContinue putting money in cheer for one case continue to invest is also a very important thing to do you want to continue to do that [noise] and when we talk about investing one thing that we also like to do is talk about saving so I'm gonna take a little bit of time and do not this\nMorning here and I happen to think that there really is a three porch process here first she should save than what you should be doing is you should be investing and they grow in your mind and how what what do we mean by that well number one is that before you begin putting money into for one case IRAs\nTax qualified retirement plans [noise]\nWe're it cost you money to pull it out taxes and especially if you're under the age of fifty nine and a half costs and digital taxpayer money out what you want to make sure is that your personal savings your liquidity the emergency fund that you should have this really full we call it the vault\nNow everybody's fault is different so folks feel like I Need three months worth of backup to feel comfortable some folks will say I need six months from so folks and need ear and my my wife she might need like five years\nAs we get older what I have found in my experience or is that\nCash is king and what happens is folks become feeling more comfortable there will continue to grow a as their wealth gross and be also as their age grows because there is a comfort in cash the ability to get a hold of cash to do things so I get what we are talking about here it is having a vote of cash having\nLiquid available for you not having to borrow to deal with emergency the same time would also like to say as you know the financial planners dilemma if it might be is that\nAny significant capital consumption issue that you have whether it's paying for salads wedding or possibly putting in a new floor doing a new or do we're doing a new kitchen or taking a big trip I mean when you five ten thousand archer\nYou want to make sure that that money is also especially if it's within six to twelve month period you also want that money set aside\nIn safe safe from risk of loss\nYou don't have to worry about where the markets aren't timing to get your access is get your hands on that money and as a part of the process that we have with plenty for our clients is we're doing or semi annual rebalance what we do at the same time is every six months we're recruiting of cash to help them deal with their\nCurrent cash flow needs the income needs that we're providing just like we talked about our last example with Joan Judy\nBut also seeing what needs of cash do you have help deal with that capital consumption of event that you might have been so we're also putting that money aside so [noise]\nHaving the cash for not having to borrow not having to invade your ... et cetera is really the way that you want to go so that's kind of level on [noise] so if you have your savings taking care of that it's a new a matter of saying okay\nNow let's look at investing\nThe best place to invest will without question\nIs it a qualified retire replant if you're if you have an opportunity to access an employer sponsored plan for care for three four fifty seven [noise] where you do have an employer that also is making some level of matching contributions you've got to go there\nBecause if they're making a contribution that contribution they're making is an automatic rate of return for you think about it let's say that your your ... your company has a twenty five percent match\nOr the first three percent you put it that sound like it's a lot it's only point seven five percent but if you put in that full three per cent you've already earned twenty five percent by their contribution\nThey didn't have full three per cent you've already earned twenty five percent by their contribution before you even start start and we know that qualify plants grow income tax deferred until retirement [noise]\nOf course ... bar income tax free as long as the money is put in even though it's after taxes stays there for five years the other thing with most qualified plans or is that the expenses are ... are\nYou using in many case you're not using an advisor in many cases so you're not pay in advisory fee which can run anywhere from you know [noise]\nWe only charge one percent but it could be we see them as highs two and a half percent we've seen them less lowest point seven five percent so you're not paying an advisor fetus issued managing that that's that's an automatic savings at the same time would also you're getting involved in here is either load wave during the load generally funds\n\nInstitutional class share so that the expenses to those funds are also are very low pre tax employers paying for the expenses that are low paying advisory fees\n[noise] that's the best place to do it so if you're once you've loaded up your so he gets you thinking what part what part to bar one is if I filled up the ball park Jews I feel I'm filling up I thought my retirement accounts in part three would be safe\nAgain open a brokerage account\nA non advisory counting begins to invest money and accumulate that after taxes well some folks asking Jeff should we do a Roth or should we continue to should we do it or should we just do it on her own it and frankly I think it's just a matter of how much of a quid imbalance that you have\nA I don't have a raw firing myself I Know many clients do I was no I've never been eligible to do raw fiery\nBut\nWhy lock up the money for five years especially if you're going to need even if it's the income tax free growth I mean frankly you can always by [noise]\nFinancial interests on the sea ice officers Jamil

introduce our guest where we are very happy to have back with us today April Haskins who is the administrator for the villages at St Peter's memory care which is an assisted living facility\nDesigned for those living with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia and April journey with memory care began as a young girl seeing her grandfather suffer with the effects of Alzheimer's and dementia\nAnd we're also joined today by and war and who is the director of nursing at the village is at St Peter's memory care\nAnd also as personal experience in dealing with a family member who had memory loss and ... she has over nine years in the geriatric field of care she has specialized training and dementia and Alzheimer's care wound care and\nInteract which is a quality improvement program that focuses on clinical and educational tools and strategies for long term care facilities welcome back\nIn ... um you know this is one of those subjects that\nAre on the one hand none of us wants to talk about it on the other hand many people as they age are having to deal with and I think that it's one of those subjects that that people just would prefer would go away but the reality is that it seems tell me if this is my generation that\nA lot of the progress that we read about in medicine about medical science and technology that are extending people's lives that are curing illnesses and diseases I don't see that level of progress in the area of dementia and Alzheimer's too is that a fair\nImpression CIS certainly no cure at this time um I think that there diligently\nWorking to uh find a cure but right now it's it's still a very limited uh medicines that can be used and even those that are available to use a lot of people are\nI think misinformed thinking that it's going to slow down the progression or stop\nRussian and what people are looking for is is a solution and in I guess the the things we read about these medications um they're just almost a yawn I mean the the ... you hear about very very modest benefits\nAnd maybe they would that would be more interesting maybe if I were the person that added or for my mother died but I'm reading about the extension of live in a matter of months\nAh well we had a neighbor had pet him out of it I mean we outgrew that a particular dog um no they don't bring their own pots um what they do utilize a lot though are the mechanical pots um\nIt feels very much like what they had at home so we have Cooper who's a dog and he barks any rolls over and his battery operated\nAnd we don't have to clean up any my son did they feel very comfortable that town\nIt's a lot easier to live with dementia and thrive when you are surrounded by other people living with dementia\nAnd people develop relationships with the with the people in their neighborhood\nThey add a little late and then and it's very non threatening they can have a conversation with a fellow neighbor we as the outsiders may stand there and over a lesson and not\nTruly understand what that conversation is about but they're smiling they're laughing they're touching are communicating and that is extremely important for them because in the world outside of our memory care community when they were back in the real world it's very easy for people to constantly\nTold them to write them wrong righted reorient um or sometimes not even a saying anything but\nYou don't realize it's on your face or the low to the point on talking yeah ... I'm always saying something wrong I'm making her mad or I'm making her cry\nYou know I can see exactly what you're talking about but can still they're sophisticated enough still due to read those cues from view life but you may not be consciously communicating\nWell and the one thing we always say as they may not remember what you said to them but they will always remember how you make them feel\nIs you know they may not know your name even as a care partner but it's highly trained my staff you know they're going to remember if you've upside down so you need to be an actor and actress every day you know smile be big be jovial the ah extra cars are going to pick up on all of the odd\nSo let's talk about the\nPeople who are listening they may have someone living at home who is struggling due to\nCognitive things and yet they're not sure whether that time has come whether they should consider but moving their loved one perhaps remember care facility what criteria\nWould you give the listener to help them make a decision as to when it ...\nWould say first if they are questioning that it could potentially be the right time start tore get out there and go to like a new enemy is um you don't have to have appointments you can show up any day or of the week any time of day\nStart to get comfortable with the options before you feel that you absolutely need to make that ... I think ... probably speak better too\nYou absolutely need to make that ... I think ... probably speak better to why not the right time\nAnd you're going to start seeing things like a\nMedicine is not being filled in a timely manner uh\nYou know those are things that\nIf you ask them of course they're going to you know say Oh absolutely you know but I hate to say sneaking around but if you have to you and you happen to be at mom's house and you happen to use her bathroom you might want to take a look at the dates that are on those\n... and I think I I have a feel for kind of what you're describing used that\nIs that we can expect these people to want to me to keep their independence is the ... so to the extent that any of us would feel an obligation to conceal our failures in that way so it does require a little bit of investigation perhaps on the part of a child to\nSyria and U.S House also so um common recurring theme for a lot of the neighbors that move in to our community is there's been a death of a spouse and then all of a sudden the family\nIs like whole league how how long has this been going on\nSo are you saying that the spouse is covering war there\nBecause they're fearful that you're gonna you're you're going to take my wife and you're going to put her in a nursing home for a lot of them um [noise]\nOlder picture of a nursing home um we certainly had a long way to go sell but we've come a long way from uh the coating is that we use and all you you know deal\nOr to some of these people when they're not tied down ... chairs we're not using electric therapy on um a\nFear I think another thing that the caregivers should think about when thinking is this the right time as their own health\nDoes it look like dementia are very resilient and you know yes there may be a period that they need to get acclimated to their new environment but they do and if you're the caregiver and\nThat's probably one of the hardest jobs in the world would be to care for somebody with a bunch are twenty four seven because you know you can't take your eyes off you don't know what the next thing will be um\nAt your own health is starting to fail because of that\nProbably a good thing I Want to take it or if they get it out additional help\nBut you know I think that the best cells\nOr for that in the minds of many\nMany spouses would not be the argument that it's very true that you just made that you know this is not healthy for you to have your a cognitively impaired spouse so I think that the best\n... the the the the best persuasion would occur but way of saying to that person I'm thinking about\nMy family members but certainly would be just say to this person this is why your husband or wife will be better off\nI think to just say to them even though what you just said is true that is hard on them it's difficult but but because they love this person that won't be the reason that they participate in this transition I think many of\nOur community\nIs a blessing um\nThey can be less methods\nYou know I I see very often when I go to do the assessments\nUm to make sure that we're the level of care that they need\nThere's a lot of minutes because the family is\nTrying to honor and what they promised maybe dad you know um oh no I Wish that we were going to you know take care of her and they're\nYou know on how at all or they're on these really happy drugs drugs are necessary because they are at home\nBecause there are some downing and so you're down to sundown owning a curse for not all but for a majority of those living with dementia that as the leader afternoon\nAs the sun starts to go down they become extremely active they have a lot of distress reactions they become very busy um it's almost like the circadian rhythms kind of flip through them nights are mixed and like you said they're up at night\nAre more restful during the day now imagine that\nThis is your mom and you're still working\nHere east I've got kids that you're trying to get through San ... lately so you're still going to work you can't be with mom at two o'clock in the morning but what happens when mom goes out the front door and doesn't remember how to get back\nFor doesn't mean to she thinks she's hungry and she puts a can of spaghetti goes into the microwave and catch something on fire [noise]\nWe're hearing them up walking around here and so all of these things start\nHappening all of a sudden we've got locked in alarms all over the house we've got cameras installed everywhere we've got all these methods um you see it over and over and over again on their diagnosis\nThan the ...\nWell here's the problem with that\nSometimes does not work and sometimes they won't because if those methods work on the part of the brain that isn't there anymore\nNot going to sleep for the now\nMedicine to make them sleepy but they're still\nIt's not working on that part of the brain so they still get up but their bodies tired and there's more falls that can occur that way as opposed to just now they might break a hip being able to allow them to be twenty four seven actually\nSource of what you're describing a scenario where at home it's going to require twenty four seven vigilance those sort of a very often yes sort of on call on duty ... writes a and\nAnd it's also not good for them because it means that they're gonna have to some point try to fit into the schedule of this working family\nThat is now as often because they are hearing their loved one up walking all night they sleep a kind of on edge um you know we had\nPainted a picture of\nA rope [laughter] around her and her mom so that she could make sure that it mom got up in the middle of the night that she would go out and I'm like wow\nSo how is life better and you know member care facility that what we describe to give the contrast\nLike and

noticed some of these problems was assuming that that they're significantly down the road in terms of knowing this broad Diggs is I'm\nI'm Wondering how they can uh how they approach this whole topic with a person they care about I'm going to jump to conclusions do somebody will be fair that often this loved one spouse or parrot\nMade I'll be someone who's well very open to this idea additionally at least initially I saw it in to tell me how you often see this I should probably be talking to you I Will\nTell me how this often um proceeds in a way that is positive and involuntary\nSo I think initially what I see is that the families do that for a ... and the person with dementia does not know that that's happening and\nWhat they're looking for is a place when they come in that they can see that person feeling comfortable thriving feeling safe they're meeting staff there smelling the smells of the neighborhoods they're\nMaking some of the initial determination on would this be the right place um\nHow is the first visit the often without this ... either\nMhm it's very very rare that an initial tore as a person with dementia would be there um\nIt's a lot to take in there's a lot of questions to ask and when you're having a conversation about somebody with demand shot but they're sitting right there you're not having a conversation about them in front of them so it can be really uncomfortable\nTo ask the right questions to probe the community um the person with dementia is getting antsy and wondering why you were talking about them but not to the movies\nSo it's I think that the family will accomplish more and have a better tore alone the first time I'm an honestly it's not\nToo often that the person went to a bunch of comes back to Tory usually the next time
