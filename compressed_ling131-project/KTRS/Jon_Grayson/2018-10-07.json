[laughter] the French have done it ... and his crew and so it's uh it's amazing\nThat and we've got this huge on a sort of windfall from the size of the Ryder Cup the success of the PGA Championship\nBut the point of our association is is to get back to the members um and there's twenty nine thousand as you said and so the reason I maybe got the game is the fact that I have some business background and and then I Know some people in the game the\nReason I took the job was really to make those people's lives better read the twenty nine thousand I think they're the um the backbone of the game that dozens of people that touch it from the first ball you hit to the last fall um you go home\nYou know you do it at night with um [noise] it is a a ... you know and I I think it's always been a noble profession and one that we grew up you know knowing I'm sure you know I've from the first time I took it seriously with my\nLocal cup pro you know it Kelly to to um all the other great prose that I've gotten a chance to get to know over the years\nUm [noise] you know it's it's ... it's they do it for passion but they do it because they thought they could make a great living for them and their family and and that's not as clear as it once was right it's um it's that I worry about this person that's out there that's forty five or fifty years old has got a kid going off to college and\nLessen team might be down and you can't quite figure out whether they're going to do it and so how do we take this\nA huge success we've had commercially than somehow figure out how to pass that benefit back to our members and so we'll get through this week and hopefully bring the cup home and then it's gonna be all about the members of member member member um uh as far as I'm concerned in my legacy ought to be judged by\nYou know how we how we benefitted them but you know during the time that I'm I'm In my see\nFor a special guest and if you doubt at all he has a flair for\nExcellence he chooses the twenty Eighteen Ryder Cup in Paris to make is the view that\nI have loved the Ryder Cup for a long time so back in the late nineties when Ben French hero was announced kept him I came to him with an idea of writing a book about the Ryder Cup and he was all for it and he helped me and I\nRide a cup golfs this event\nUh golf's breathe this event\nIt just seems like a year after year that title gets more accurate or by the moment and the thrill for me\nWas that was in ground publishing you'll get a kick out of this and they can you get to do the forward\nI said I don't know it's a pretty good friends with Jack Nicklaus so I could ask him and they almost fell off the chair thinking I was kidding but I called jak\nYou should send them the manuscript he read it called back so that he'd be proud so when the coverage when it said my name is ... ... what do you think I said I don't care if we Silicon Valley so is\nIt exactly but the Ryder Cup certainly has grown I'm going to be an important aspect of your job moving forward we keep same every time we hold the competition they can't get any bigger but\nI guess it can yeah no well it's going to be it's going to be harder now because they've they've done an amazing job but you know it was first of all your story is terrific one and it's a reflection on you by those as well as the game right that we all have these great friends and everybody will will do whatever it is for a friend in the game right before that's jak or [noise]\nOr banner or whomever and that's that's the beauty of it all um towards the Ryder Cup yeah I mean it it turns out that you know tribalism is alive and well All right it's it's a beauty behind the Olympics I think it's wise soccer so powerful I'm In so many ways um end to play for your country doesn't have to be you know\nFortunately a lot of the guys that are playing this week really on both sides are friends and it you know it's just different right and it's different in a way that is I'm\nPure and and I think reminds him of why they love the game as much as um you know a lot of how much they love their country is right and so it's a it's just an amazing reflection of everything and and I think there is an arms race right to uh\nUh just sort of you know make it bigger and better every year because the public deserves it um than it's\nYou know we hope and I I Would look we're coming off of a transcendent moment in golf of last Sunday read in terms of tiger's victory and [noise] and how that played out and that's the beauty of the tour of recreating Jones that Jones and already at a saint Andrews was amazing um my son is a good player and\nHave been around the game a lot of you know a tear it up at that moment and and I think that's the power of of the game and and so what we're doing and now we get to lead into this um event which is what should make it as maybe the one of the group of the greatest weeks and the and the game's history if we have the competition that we think we're going to have so\nYou know two years from now we'll we'll be trying to set a so joke last night I said it does it do you think we can build a palace in color Wisconsin and and then two years to\nTry to compete with they've done here and ah it'll be great it'll be different it'll be local as every one of these things should be but ah [noise] um you know we'll we'll do our best to to make everyone proud about the next event\nThing was for um [noise]\nI was in tigers press conference yesterday and I raised my hand to ask a question when the ... came to me I said tiger I don't know if anybody formally in the media said thank you\nFor what you did on Sunday [noise] but I can tell you anybody in the Gulf business\nDid job was made better\nBy your accomplishments on Sunday and I really meant that because he touches all aspects of the game and you have the challenge now you're going to be\nHead of the PGA of America with its first female president Suzie rarely who yeah she's gonna be an outstanding president of course she's standing two feet away from saying they kind of wild but\nNot only fantastic but beautiful to what you should go on record the prettiest president of the PGA of America ever stuff for free to see you great success which I Know it's coming and the look forward to seeing your down the road\nOpposite thanks for being such a good friend until you do for the game it's great to have fun\nWell great you're pretty ... I think a lot of people and especially the twenty seven thousand ... Bob are going to be very interested to see what steps writing to the table or their organization\nWell but the one compelling thing I got I have a conversation or he assured me\nHis main focus is going to be on the hard working men and women who are PGA professionals who are the backbone of the sport golf I think the ... the one before hand\nYes he really has he's helped me when I when I've been frustrated um and when he ... he makes it simple and doesn't complicate things and he's a great teacher he can spot anyone anyone swing what needs to happen and um\nHe doesn't over complicated like I said and uh\nYep and then um he doesn't over complicated like I said and he's a great coach ... and a great player himself\nYet so that's that's for sure I'm broke the urban is with us recently she was\nCompeting of Dr ... at Augusta National this coming summer she'll be playing all over again in a tournament and then in the spring at all a lot of high school here in St Louis for her ... she at one of the things that they posted on the Dr ... website for every\nA young boy or girl was they ask you to rank\nA yourself into three categories Dr shipping products you put a number one and it came to fruition ... because you want the party content that water\nUm it ... how ... what did you say\nWhy are you know such a good pot or what race you such a good positive I I Need help\n[laughter] um I like to go and stick with my routine I think a lot of people like to rush it and just I'm\nNot actually pick your line and ... um that's what I Do um I remember Eighteen and the masters um I decided to walk around the hall and take my time because they cause a because you know it's going to I was like oh it's going to go buy too fast\nSo that's what I did um\nI just sat and I always try to get my speed before I Try to worry about if I'm making making the pilots are on the tiny green earth why am I\nSo I Try to do that um and I just it takes a lot of practice I probably a pilot for an hour each day trying to get better um\nAnd sometimes it's just I think I think is very key sometimes you sometimes they go in and sometimes they don't like you just have to be patient and trust yourself\nPublic strict either some days you feel like you're going to make everything\nThan those living up backstage those two words you can't even find a way in which we're talking with their man who is who was on a a wonderful track and and that I'm sure your your parents uh we got to give credit to them\nOr for getting involved and and then had any of the game and you mentioned ... ... that's a wonderful place to play you got thirty six oh so most of the time even as the junior golf or\nUm you can find your way out of course are they've got a good practice facility I'm saying all but it's a wonderful place to to do on your game I've got to\nSay yes it is I feel really grateful and\nI appreciate them I'm\nAllowing me to come in out in practice out there um it's a great facility and I know I don't have any excuses not to be good [laughter] so yeah I Am I've worked really hard out there and um I feel like it's a great opportunity to become a better golfer and\nUm the people out there are so nice so it's a really good really good course too\nI like to ask young people that have had success in golf or or even just play the game broke our hearts go help you away from the course what impact is being involved in the sport or a game of golf you think uh help us as an individual\nIt's really helped me to learn how to be independent and how to work hard if you want to get a where you want to be um\nAnd I know that and it's taught me that you're going to have good breaks and bad brakes um especially in golfing in life um sometimes those breaks you don't want that they're going to happen so it's it's golf is a great game um and I've learned a lot from it stirs through the years\nOr young lady you had your little dog like that it's for sure don't let anybody mess with it because we're a yard sale along quite nightly nicely inviting if you are I'm Jealous I think we'll get\nA masters tournament five times but I never hear that part I never watched any

South Carolina by more than one hundred yards total for the day\nGround game unbelievable\nWhat the third quarter the third quarter from hell\nMay have doomed the tigers and who knows about the long term repercussions I I'm not one to say this ruins the season\nBut it certainly set you up for three game losing streak because your plate number one Alabama in Tuscaloosa next Saturday I mentioned the third quarter from hell included in that maybe the play that turned this game for good\n\n[noise] South Carolina\nTwenty three and a White House on for the point after your third quarter and driving rainstorm Columbia South Carolina\nOr driving rainstorm that Dario them said afterwards she didn't really prepare for his uh weather app told them twenty percent chance of rain and then he said I was assuming there was any percent chance it wasn't going to happen\nI I I get it I I don't think either side was really prepared I mean not only did it rained I mean the skies opened up\nTo think about all the rain they probably gotten after the hurricane roll through you know that's ground that is more than saturated and you could tell that third quarter ... water coming up every time they made a step\nAnd also what's up with these what's up with these schools with grass fields still let me go to any high school just about any high school in Missouri they got that\nNew age astro does have an astroturf anymore but it's true or if that allows you to go out there and play football game even in a driving rainstorm obviously you can't play lightning and there was more than an hour lightning delay\nBut they played that third quarter in that rainstorm because there was no lightning they kept going and the conditions were not favorable for football certainly not favorable for past football\nThrowing the football\nAnd drew locked in nine times in that third quarter you know how many patches he completed one he completed one for nine in that third quarter why were they throwing the ball so much you want to know what myths do rushed on the day for\nBuilding dreams is their business meaty camper\nDot com a zoo football color analyst Howard Richard\nSmart father died without a will I ended up finding and insurance policy and in the new any when he knew I found that digging through his effects\nScott Garcia of premier estate an income planning most\nPeople are the understanding that they have a we'll do annoyed probate that's all they have in most cases they will not have ... which are the vast majority of people find that out too late and it really is planning is not complicated can be with us it's not complicated and we have a Ninety Ninety proprietary process we can do most of the state plans Ninety percent of the Ninety minutes\nAttend the next educational workshop Tuesday October twenty third\nAnd Thursday October twenty ... pm Costa house in Arnold, Missouri law three one four five eight zero zero five\nTo four seeding is limited reservations are required three one four five eight zero zero five to four premier estate in income planning meeting the mess T.

I'm\nSure that that put us back in Columbia laid back to St Louis so I'm I'm here in this discussion of what you turned out to be pretty disappointing loss yesterday in Columbia\n... there's also this how did you have any idea what's going to rain the way it rained\n[noise] no I don't want to look at the weather out as well to an hour it's only showed ... percent chance of right well and there was\nNo chance of rain whatsoever so one of those pop ups storms that uh you reminded me you know for those people that are used to go into South Florida\nUm you know he's do you use these tropical down or is that a big kind of suck everything is known a few hours later it's all sunshine and lose touch\nAnd you can you factor in the fact that it's a that's a natural grass surface power and it was um it and you also factor in how much\nIt was a saturated by the ... came through it was sort of a a a recipe for disaster and uh the debt that third quarter Howard I talked about the first segment I don't understand why do through the ball as much as they did in that driving rainstorm\nNo I don't either I just go back to the but the surface you know it's probably one of the ... of of seeing or\nEven though they're you know lots of rain due to the previous hurricanes drains very quickly actually drain very quickly uh yesterday to\nLots of bill segue for money you know play on natural grass football is is is the best way to go off fewer injuries beer injuries anyway but um yeah I had a third quarter it just makes sense especially with a chick such as Missouri has been\nRunning the football um did you just open yourself up to um you know too many things that can go wrong even though you practice one with a wet football um\nIt's still the conditions just weren't ideal and the ... members say three ... probably two or three\nTouchdowns attempts I'm just missed opportunities by this team that I'm In South Carolina as always stuff at home but uh this was set up for for the tigers to go in and and and steal one from\n... in Cox and I'm just too many uh miss chances to to make it up\nHow much did they miss a not just the manual hall would need round in that game in the in the passing the Jack Howard\n[noise] well you certainly feel that uh especially with the man you all know what his ability to stretch the field vertically and open up he was on a nice\nUm the challenge just wasn't there as often but you know the the fear factor because everyone knows what Emanuel coffee or do you see you can't really abruptly\nSo what it is having the knowledge it does not play you know I think you can adjust your types of coverage is let me know that\nUm they're very few people with that type of ... that are going to stretch yourself you can clamp down and and attacked Missouri much wonderfully without a speed burger up there\nAnd it certainly the the Austin certainly looked a little different but again as we said how are they they ramble incredibly well I mean the al deen South Carolina by some a hundred and twenty yards total so even if it's not to watch that scene but we're getting to the point right now both in the all three Crockett\nBrown tree meaty they all the average better than six yards per carry a there was nothing wrong with the wind is Randall football yesterday\nI said earlier you know there were so much concern at the beginning of the season that all this you know learn they're rushing game and just stuck there well you know you have to understand still ship plane I knew a ...\nA system that brand new but there are things are better or something like that for a short of just even against you know the mind Georgia I'm no one's own problems really running the football\nI'm In Missouri has got the type of backs that can get it done\nWhen Russian a ball but yet two hundred and eighty six yards rushing the ball gets um you know a front three that you know had really been doing well against Iran very destructive\nUh Missouri didn't really have any problems during the football um so yeah it's a little about things in the third quarter is why we did you\nUm you know ground the ball especially bad weather conditions but even then there are still a number of opportunities are I mean let's let's start with shorter even if the notes that I'm a\nWriter to Missouri touched down shut down the game\nYou know apparently he was a patient problem yeah we saw own size cake that was supposed to be each get not sure how that happens but you know\nSouth Carolina got the ball in the short field and converted for touched down you know if you believe in that field and maybe they don't score type job maybe they only pick up you know go strike that can be a ballgame for 'em you later on\nA ... and all sides penalty that\nAh that kept the south Carolina Dr alive\nOr later on an upside penalty by Albert a over oh to stop the dry and then case cook a whole a penalty takes back person tend to proceed Tony they ended up\nKicking field goal and maybe that you know they were able to go in a score touched down there and also later on after that myth touchdown opportunity inside we are on the street or where the jury ended up kicking\nAnother few goal instead of the ... an extra point or the drive stalls at the start of the third quarter then that disastrous drive their hair um another legal motion penalty Alberto a Fifteen yard a motion like Congress will be crooked\nCase critical last side sure falls apart\nA little bumble part about the court it's only just mishandled\nA just just things falling apart things that really should not happen\nLater on a bad decision by law you know he's backpedaling and throw the ball off his back with us to South Carolina maybe three defenders area didn't even see Missouri Claire anywhere near um just should not have been thrown out about 'em\nThey just needed to ... uh I guess you could say one more in regulation and I believe would have walked out a a a fourth and winter so uh yeah it's a\nIt's a tough tough start for him or when you're ... shares in your opening night with ... Thursday that split up at it you know he just got a two and all that out and keep going and\nYeah I don't want to throw kerosene and fired that they want to uh\nUh when it suited him but that later so pitched to shut up last night for\nA little boy yeah there you go JT outside talking about somebody who cares if I guess you sure did um but you mentioned it to support around him not want to play a cut from ikea last night trying to identify the players who are capable of coming through in crunch time right now\n[noise] brutal and he said this is not winning hockey the land right now so this is just as\nWe can try to analyze or for euro whatever the reasons are maybe we maybe we just think that we're good maybe I'm maybe with more competition guys are thinking that if they will score a little bit more than I don't put them out of the game I'm\nReally the way that you're going to get out of the games to make one in place and then when I'm when I sign that's how it's going to be doing those guys\nAre going to do things that just went on the games and that can be keeping the go to the obviously that can be often too and he's going to get more opportunity if somebody is hurting us then he's going to start to lose opportunity that's that's just the nature of the game\nI'm not sure if it's relating to score a goal last night JT but ah Chris Butler's been are sent down and a ... the newest blue could be ready to play correct\nJacob chair back he showed up uh\nUh he showed up a Saturday ... now cleared up and uh so yeah I and when he knew that when he called me called law and Chris Butler were workplace all their time Robert ... because\nOf a situation with Robert ... beach Spanish for the first game like equal I got that down after that allow ... will be ready to go\nA Thursday\nOr a you know after missing the first to be honest with a growing issue and so they uh they lay out\nIn butler down to make room for your back and look for right now and wait and blues or that stole that I carry an extra defense and then this will give them a defense men\nOr Thirteen or it's just to actually to spare defense men\nOn a one step forward and and this will give them a chance to look the chair but even in a practice setting and ah and see what he or she has a you know eventually a jarring swells could be a a could be sent down but he ... he has to clear waivers\nI hate to say this JT listening to yo last night talking about the goals and he said there were there were some good goals\nBy the club last night I couldn't help but think a little bit of can Hitchcock because there was a time where you know here\nYou know if if you're thinking too much about scoring that's when you're given up goals on the other end and I'm Wondering JT from your vantage point or\nOr maybe what was discussed in the room afterwards how many of those goals were may be given up a movement was a new to power play goals I should say but I'm ... was there may be too much concentration on the off and some end\nUm to watch for regulation goals go in and then of course the one in overtime\nWhile the black ... ... they don't have a lot of that but their top line guys are as good as any right now we're talking about the break at it and Jonathan case and Patrick Kane and very FAST Team and again that counter attack\nHim in Chris Butler made match it up as a locked it last night\nThat got sucked in some times where all that they tried that can move on applied and maybe make something happen off at subway and got caught in the game and then boom in counter attack and Adnan rashes and and all of a sudden uh uh uh the boys were left off high and dry so that definitely\nHappened last night on all sides and part of the blues identity at least in a row of slate a playoff send a ... and even last and you don't want to miss the playoffs by a point a lot of it\nWas based on being sound offensively a ball to the corners during the dirty work\nYou know our battles blocking shots all and I think it's a valid point by a life that we hadn't seen a whole lot of um any of that and then\nAll these are all these players and and and the young players coming up maybe a little bit too worried about hey that's a lot longer to\nScore goals I that is for gold and forgetting about a little parts of the game but by the sea when our hockey even if you're ... or you know you you have to play some of these parents and that that's been incredibly ... and his first two games\nOn the positive side Jay Z and in this kind of sets us up much more on the big blue show later this week but O'Reilly for us is already you know at least in terms of what you would do should for him all sensibly kind of delivering a exactly what you thought\nOh yeah and and not only not only that last night\nAnd he was a he missed by like one on thousands of of a percentage point from being the top face off sky and late but he also won more total face off than anybody twenty twenty three twenty out of twenty\nTotal face off than anybody or to adequate three\nTwenty twenty try saucy one and a and at last night with that ... out there was all the time and space here even you know if you if you're if you're in your own though your defenses are just getting uh getting out is that ship so yeah the dolphin show a lot of science\nAlive I last night at ... ... what was just like well Harriet played last night a lot more of a chair that scored wearing head tall or Chicago's the old\nHire two minutes ... ever let her two minutes and even after the death penalty fired all of that ad fodder maybe cancer won't want to point more second so you ... are on that side and I'm going to war you\nKnow ... you got you got a good bad or\nOr you know that there are some guys talk night this was not all that crap that's best right now is that change I've already backed out a couple of crime and or ... or ... prize that they'd do a little stir along the Gulf yet about sports ... says where
