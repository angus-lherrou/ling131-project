in New York City ... welcome to the show good to be here I Am and what's the latest on the manhunt\nDo well we don't know that there is a man to hunt yet there there has been no the suspect identified that we have been able to tell and authorities are still pick it up bombs and so there's no telling how many more may be out there they are analyzing them now at the FBI lab in Quantico they could exploit them for clues\nFingerprints DNA origin of materials that may help them understand where the materials were were bought and perhaps from where they were sent but so far we're not sure that ah they've completed any of that work yet\nWhen you go back to the Unabomber investigation and one of the things that help to figure out who he was worse several phrases and things that he used in his manifesto that his brother recognized ... with these envelopes we have several misspellings and other things like that can be used that same kind of investigative technique to try to figure out who mailed these things\nFor the the I I think they'll try all sorts of techniques one of the ... that they have and detonated devices is a trove of forensic information remember say how the Boston Marathon bombing investigation when they they were able to piece together bits of the pressure cooker\nAnd then figure out the model and then figure out where that model is sold in the greater Boston area and\nThen figure out the model and then figure out where that model is sold in the greater Boston area and then they have the Tsarnaev brothers you know on on video walking into a particular store\nIt's painstaking work though and it isn't necessarily quick work so they're they're trying to extract some of that information now as they work to determine who the sender was\nAn air and do they think that does tend to drop them off because from what I heard they were not delivered by the U.S postal service is that correct um it\nTurns out were and and that does confirmed the fears of law enforcement that these items could make their way through the vast a postal system a undetected in particular let's look at the the the package that was sent to CNN for John Brennan\nThe former CIA director it was a\nSet through the mail it arrived at a at a post office here in New York City\nAnd then present and here's what practice all their mails handed off to a private courier service so than the envelope with a with a device got caught up and then all of CNN's male dumped into their sorting and screening room that's how it ended up there and it was an alert employee who noticed that this this thing didn't look right\nWow Werner investigators making of the fact that none of these devices and again we can consider ourselves lucky for this even though they had the ability to go all certainly all the components were there none of them did\nAnd I got it right and I and the the authorities don't know whether the bombs were just a bill poorly you would with structural flaws or whether it was a ... intentional that they they they were not meant to go off there's no way of knowing until they find\nThe other suspect but the components were there\nFor these devices to maim for kill and if you look at the in particular the powder the explosive powder and and the glass shards that were included are meant to be shrapnel that gives investigators some real concern that that the intent was to do damage\nThis is why we are at St Louis you're\nI'm Scott over federal unfair officials are now investigating can pipe bomb like devices to high profile Democrats another assume President Trump has singled out for criticism to were founded post offices in Delaware this morning addressed the former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd another in New York City center actor Robert De Niro and investigators believe there could be more out there you're they'd be the there and concerts\nEight I think investigators are working on the assumption that and more devices who will be found and they are concerned we've learned now that the the package sent to CNN for John Brennan\nActually did travel through the u._s. mail\nThat has law enforcement officials worried because\nSent through this vast network\nOn detected and they don't know how many more might be out there post\nOffices around the country are now on high alert\nWhy didn't the mail system catch this because that's what

watching at home or getting ready out in the uh out in the parking lot to go into the stadium ... you saw him a boy played several seasons with Atlanta\nIn Baltimore and almost here in St Louis with the Ramsey twenty twelve and a now is a is an NFL analysts do football analyst and a go of course the great Wake Forest demon deacon as well\nAnd the tailgating expert Ovie welcome\nOr thanks for having me it's going to be\nGood to hear your voice and I I guess now this is the best part of retirement right as you get the tailgate and show off your skills on the grill\nSo absolutely I'm able to participate in the tailgating without feeling terrible the next day bumps than Bruins moving toward this strain that so that is a positive to a like a football\nYeah no doubt about it and I guess you know when we talk about tailgating and that's where it's all going to start is not on the gridiron but on the grill is to talk about your ghrelin skills\nOh well you know I Love grilling love great food\nSo that was the the the START I talked to upgrade my whole ghrelin profile but getting the X. two hundred true infrared portable gas grill with sharp world and all that have have a door both parents think cuts in case somebody travelling easy but I have the high impact frame but unprecedented Twain's Georgia square inches of cooking space [noise] them with 'em like they\nHave the puts ... slid mountain temperature gauge how ... and a caring adult can make it easy is on parallel of important to me\nChocolate have the forgiving him for cooking technology which prevents flare ups and make food juice here so that forgiving of cooking technology makes me even at my worst seem like a pro on that grill\nAt a boy and we've also got a new one that we can talk about getting the place ready I especially if you're having people over the tailgate before the game if you're having people come over to the house you want to make sure the police looks right and then you've got all the supplies you need to get some tips tourists there as well\nYou know back inside with John bracing for blow\nThis hour presented by our sanitation where they want your stake in business\nIt is a limited twenty on the big five fifty Katie Irish and uh you know the weather we were talking about earlier the fact that we've already reached today's high so it's kind of all downhill from here but the thing I Love about when the weather gets cold like this\nYet that you like do something like oh I Do I Love everything about it but it it it makes this guy do some really cool things and I don't know how many people saw this this morning there was a time on my commute in\nWhere there were these cloud formations that look like giant ropes across the sky was the coolest thing check that out how that is pretty show and just I mean it it's a great time to look up in this guy\nParticularly because if you're a nighttime sky watcher as I Am on\nA lower humidity made a better view of what's going on up there so if you look through a telescope or if you just do naked eye viewing\nAnd looking for satellites and constellations uh this is a terrific time because it's not too too cold yet you could throw in a jacket go outside and you'll get a much better view of this guy that you normally do many good things are not cruel Chris whether yes indeed in in the news or another ... in a series of weird stories over the last couple of days\nWas that and I heard McGraw talking a little bit about this this morning these two girls are I think they're eleven and twelve years old in the booming metropolis of barge over Florida\nUh where they they had allegedly cropped up there's murder plot where they were going to kill and cut up a bunch of people in their school this is a middle school we're talking about the off eleven and twelve year old girls and there was some kind of said panic influence and all of this now in all honesty\nUh I remember being eleven and twelve years old and hearing kids talk about things they were learning about for the first time and had no idea what they were all about so I I think that the chances\nThat these two girls were actually involved in some kind of say ten a cult or ceremony pretty slim but uh that's not to say that what they weren't planning here was dangerous it obviously was and they had knives and other things that they were going to use\nAnd I guess when the police arrived they had already met in the bathroom where they were going to me to start off this killing spree of there's good God weird part about as well I guess everything is weird about this but an an additional weird part a just a coincidence I eat lunch with a friend of mine in that\nTown in ... a week ago tell us about the town of town is is is very different from what it used to be a lot to say if the places you know Bush Satan is no it's not and that's that's the strange part about it is that uh when when we moved to central Florida many years ago\nA bar to was the ...\nIt was just middle of nowhere a it's not that far from Tampa it's probably about a forty minute drive\nAnd nowhere or it's not that far from Tampa it's probably about a forty minute drive from the middle of Tampa a but it was you know there was a lot of ground a lot of cow pasture around and since then it's grown up quite a bit and what it is become\nIs a community of artists\nAnd so there is a uh it's if you've ever been to the Nashville area it's a it's very much akin to a old town Franklin, Tennessee which is south of Nashville by a little bit it it has a lot of the same DNA is much smaller than Franklin is but when you walk down the main street what used to be city hall is now a museum and art museum\nAnd right across the street from it or a bunch of shops where local artists pedal their wares and when we were there\nAnd they had just had an art exhibit a couple of days earlier where a chalk artists drew I Love that on the sidewalk out in the town square in front of the this old city hold it's now a museum so it's that kind of town it's very idyllic age it's very uh art friendly and it has grown\nBy leaps and bounds from what it used to be one it was the boondocks back in the day or so to hear that a town like this is what's on these two eleven and twelve year old girls to crack up this plot it it just it's completely in Congress but I guess that that kind of thing isn't really gonna fit anywhere right\nSome at one juror judge if we'll hear more about it because they're minors right\nBut just as a little things that are in case you're wondering I've never heard of this place bar to a ... now you know at least a little bit about the town\nYou live in Nashville and by tell us like Franklin isn't that what Eli part and lived way to Joe and Franklin\nUh the judges definitely well the judge lived in Brentwood and I and I think it was in the Franklin area which is all the southern Nashville a deli I sought still lived out or at least in pigeon forge but it could be wrong I don't know where her how you know she's not returning my car [laughter] no I'm not sure it's funny you should\nSay that though because a while I was there I was lucky enough to have not one but two of the judge coal my show just a random just\nBecause they were like oh you know not that went on a call ... uh no she's the only one that didn't uh but her mom Naomi\nDid a one athlete you name calling Christmas Eve in and actually called after a Kentucky Wildcats game 'cause she's a big basketball fan and\nThey live on that same compound as I understand\nRight and and she was headed back there but apparently she had had some trouble with some of the fans of the opposing team be really nasty and she wanted event\nIn my producer said actually jobs on the phone you want to talk to her and my response or something like are you crazy of course I Want to talk to her get her number I Know but\nIt was yeah it was kind of thing and they're very very nice to be ... never talked to a deli though so maybe one of these days yes he's putting out\nOn the other similar at least as far as the school connection is concerned there's another weird stories across the desk out of a ... pen live which is the uh it's one of the big newspapers in Pennsylvania\nYeah and we do like you to tax or call about this for one is that there are three one for Ninety six nine five eight seven seven because that just in the article should we get rid of homecoming caught competitions and this morning John and I were chatting with my God did you know he was the homecoming king\nNo but I mean if you ask me I Would have guessed [laughter] 'cause of course he is you know it was just student athlete look at the dude you know he's a big tall guy and all of that show he's perfect fodder for our own\nFamily does to call him king mail and then now I ...\nI'm sure he would enjoy that ... he's probably been wondering why we haven't done that up till now but yeah I mean this whole idea of what we should get rid of homecoming king and homecoming court let me be perfectly honest about this from the get go I don't care [laughter] you know\nHow to do this in a lot of people do care\nRight and and that's the thing is I recognize that but uh you know I don't want to add any importance to this that it doesn't already have homecoming king and homecoming queen oh for crying out loud does anybody do you remember who it was in your class I'm now me I Do not me either and that's\nWhere it looked like and I believe my sister still friends with her but now I I Can't\nI Know who it was when I was a sophomore but that's just because I was friends with her so you know it but as far as anything else that happened after that I really wasn't very much attention which shouldn't come as a shock to anybody but the curious thing about this is that they're using as justification of the fact that it puts a pitch girls against each other\nShow you're taking a bunch of girls who are friends and turning them into rivals for homecoming queen\nBut what about the kings does it ... boys against one another\nWill see here's the thing I think if you ask my girl and he's in the other room maybe we can bring him and hear what he's doing what he's doing ... lord ... ... if you ask him I'm sure he would tell you he doesn't remember\nWho else was in his own coming court he remembers to clean the rumors of wars on her lap while you have to dance with her so but as far as the other guy we don't we don't we don't take part in the same kind of rivalries we have a different kind of rivalries uh the girls in high school did\nAnd the other piece of this and this is where it gets ... this is where they lose made a according\nTo one Betsy Hammond they prefer traditions elevate all students according to the this is from Oregon lives so this is a different high school that's already gotten rid of a their homecoming king and queen and homecoming court and she says the primary reason they ended the homecoming cord was it an annoying to a few seniors\nBased on ambiguous social criteria and social standing\nOh you mean high school\nWell ... says the world as a competitive place like home coming but I don't think we should get rid of that\nYeah I mean the idea that a few seniors were anointed based on ambiguous social criteria and social standing they wouldn't be any way they already were\nAnd they probably ... related from high school and college right\nAnd so now the other off being captains of industry and and whatever and they're still the same ... says we went to school\nWith but that that now we're standing and yet as to you know it's it's a catch all it means a jerk somebody who's like useless you never heard before\nNow I like it [laughter] ah but yeah I mean life is full of people who were anointed based on ambiguous social criteria and social standing what do you think politics is\nSomebody wants to John to ask them a garage to say the other day he says like ... I mean thank you who's a letter\nAnything okay some or whatever I was doing a show the other day\nYes it's back to let her Kenny a such a great show thank you for that by the way that always makes me laugh when I get the letter Kenny text and aid for one to six of that show is on Hulu by the way you can watch the first two seasons\nYou're a Hulu subscriber but yeah if you want to jump in about the homecoming court thing I just ... granted if this is not one of the great social issues of our time and you know if\nCare traveling cruises in Brentwood owned by pat\n... and her staff will make sure your next vacation comes off without a hitch whether it's\nPricing whether it's places accommodations altered traveling cruises knows how to navigate all the pitfalls of traveling in the twenty first century we've been on numerous trips with all the air travel on cruises the pricing and the atmosphere and the customer service second to none for your next trip\nLet all care traveling cruises help you out all the air travel duck out\nMake sure bishops post as part of your twenty Eighteen Halloween party tour Saturday October twenty seventh bishops oppose Halloween bash includes free appetizers from four to seven a costume contest live music by so punch from seven to eleven bishops opposed next at Chesterfield no our line of bishops post dot com\nLocally owned and operated proud of the big five the T R S John ... and and Jennifer Blow [noise]\nWhat do\nYou want to get it from here\nPocket and a segment of\nThe most fascinating man just walked into our studio and if he ever wondered what ... vodka St Louis ... have in common you're about to find out thank you so much for joining asked well thank\nYou very much for inviting me and\nNow I think the probably the first thing people are gonna noticed about you as you know from around here yeah [laughter] I\nI'm I'm I'm a new boys to town are ... just at the end of the uh baseball season uh with my company is made up about ... to trying to crack the U.S market\nWhere his no liquor been before and after just in the u._k. or marriage worldwide ...\nTouchy different countries and ... it has been in the U.S but we never given a proper proper fake is an I did a business deal with a great company ... the McConnell and single melts\nAnd they they've got a team will run the U.S and they they changed the city they wanted me to gay too and they chase and let me\nThank you so much for that we're we're very proud that we were on the list and then we made the top of the ... the heavier and\nStephen F St Louis and it's going to find out about it there's necessarily gay campaign going on and it's for good cause and you can have cocktails and it helps you know ... yeah\nWe call it ... tells the conservation I set up this fall because I'm a ... wildlife mine and we give Fifteen Percent profits just let the conservation anyway\nSo I raised a with three hundred thousand dollars already but now I'm In St Louis it was well snow left the day or a couple of days or gay and we would do it the day campaign with some ... ... what they would show the bar tending skills ... cocktail and give one dollar\nFrom the sale of the ... days to the trust of my business partners ... very kindly ... double ... three dollars said well hey paying the out of the Fifteen twenty balls\nWere raised about two thousand dollars and then that gets double ... not become six thousand dollars on a case to stay up all ... states drinking for a good cold\n[laughter] now did resist I noticed that she and I was on there is there a Web site where people can see where all the bars have listed if they want to learn about now leopard vodka and the next thirty days\nOh absolutely and we would uh Dean I would ah would recommend people go to this is the website it's US DOT ...\nDot com and look at the ... tells for conservation section at all say if you love snow leopards in the wild and you want to detonate outside\nBuying a cocktail there's also gave ... dot com page and its help kids save cats because one of the ways that we help ... survive in the wild wild is by educating the local children\nAnd I ... yeah\nI have seen a lot from when this was eight years galleries among guys yet because I spend my vacations\nOr you know helping the trust I'm quite a bit of all ... so I can write off into the mountains ... ... ...
