I got a small loan from my father thing is all B. S.\nAnd that they say they have uncovered a massive tax evasion and fraud that Donald Trump committed in his earlier life which I you know\nWhat they were saying was groundbreaking stuff that wasn't there reporting so use the New York times who broke the story but it was MSNBC that was doing the reporting on TV\nAnd the first thing they did we started talking about how Trump supporters aren't gonna care and you know nothing he does is going to matter to them anyway and then they started laughing about it and yucky ended up on TV and I thought here's what for poor tends to be your pretends to be a news organization\nThat is scary and they're laughing about a story about the president of the United states committing massive fraud and tax evasion and there\nIs the borders are going away [laughter] and I\nThought how could you not be embarrassed by that\nYou know forget what anybody thinks of the structure maybe in in the very first ones to crab about the fact that people don't take the new seriously when it breaks will maybe and maybe that's why like serious people will mhm give mentioned Walter Cronkite sitting there going\nYeah Kennedy was shot but no but the Republicans are happy\nI Know it has changed so much\nNow and granted there they're not network news they're either entertainment for lack of a better term but they called themselves news and it was just horrifying really was bad\nBut that aside\nOn the local front of the story they called my you're a couple of days ago and it was at everybody did it I heard channel for do it but there are a whole bunch of them that they got onto this it was even in the post where they were talking about the sex offender registry in St Louis\nAnd how St Louis city apparently is terrible at keeping up with the sex offender registry that they don't do as well as other parts of the state in terms of keeping track of where people really are a and knew how updating the list is when because people move even sex offenders move from time to\nTime and I believe this I remember that article correctly they said they didn't have the resources to keep up with that right and did I hear you say it didn't matter\nNo it doesn't and this is why this is alarmist clap trap [laughter] uh it doesn't it doesn't make any difference anyway and and what I think people fail to realize\nIs that the sex offender registry isn't there for us the it's I I Know this is how people use it they look around their neighborhood and our seventies ex offenders living nearby but that's not why it's there the why is that there is the reason why the sex offender registry is there is it gives police and other tool\nWould where if something does happen in a neighborhood in any given neighborhood if somebody is assaulted or raped or whatever it gives them a list of people to check out first it's round up the usual suspects kind of thing\nBut it even goes beyond that\nBecause let's say\nAnd this is where I think the police don't get anywhere near enough credit\nBecause of the uh you know the state registry but it's the police agencies who have to deal with this on the ground and and if you're a police officer and you want to dispute this by all means telling 'em all wet and I'm Talking about three months we wouldn't be the first three one for nine six nine five eight seven seven\nHere's what ... said about Andrew four hundred we've\nReally work I'm an old guy I don't know but I tried all kinds of stuff it's one of the few things I've ever bought that were I couldn't believe it or feel better I'd have more energy or walk twelve miles a day I feel great that changed my life it really is it's really incredible\nGuys if you'd like to lose belly fat gain energy and feel great try and grow four hundred the safe natural and affordable way to boost your testosterone go to Andrew four hundred dot com or call eight eight eight four hundred zero for three five eight eight eight for hundreds zero for three five Andrew four hundred dot com\nYou have dentures well if you have dentures or you're thinking about implant dentures you definitely want to talk to my guy my dentist Dr bowl and Dr John Boehner otherwise known as Dr velvet hands the implant dentures\nHas been new technology and he of course is an expert in that he's done thousands of implant dentures now also dental implants or you can take your existing dentures\nAnd turn them into implants you can do that too that a fraction of the costs of many of the corporations in fact when the corporate dentist come along and they send you to each dentist around town to do one of the procedures\nAt bowling dental care all the work is done at Israel the headquarters on done road in Florida and you don't need a phone number for a second opinion or a first opinion three one for nine to one thirty five hundred that through an for nine to one thirty five hundred or B.

tell me it's impossible to delete a Facebook account no oh I just want to do that do you want to delete your Facebook yes oh\nUh yeah you can do it I mean it's it's a process but uh yeah it it essentially it's in settings\nYou deactivate it which is what most most people do writing the extra step of the leading\n... yeah and I think I'm going to get back up\nSick of it up over it [laughter] is it because of that just because of spam\nWell no I got locked out I have I have to make Facebook account and I have to and I got locked out oh okay and my retrieval email addresses the same for both\nDo you still have an email address ideal but I can only ask one of their Facebook accounts now which is one that is just for family okay I Would prefer to gather in line\nBut you can't get into it now oh okay so yeah it it it does get to be\nMore hassle that's worth after a while but when I have not received yet which were all apparently going to be receiving about two and a half hours from now if I'm doing the math right now I'm not about an hour and a half from now\nIs a a text message via the president of the United states which is actually coming from FEMA but it's a presidential text alert and this is the first test nationwide of the presidential election system and it was just\nGoing to stay alert or something is going to say this test okay showed will be like\nThe ... the old emergency broadcast system tests there is a test of the emergency broadcast system so you'll get a a message it's not really a tax they keep calling it a tax it's just an alert that will show up on your phone\nAnd say this is a test of the presidential alert system and that's it I'm thinking about this that makes it a little bit troublesome is that there's no\nWay to opt out of it and that it's\nNot that you're necessarily should opt out of a presidential text message but I was picking around on the old iPhone last night\nAnd uh found\nText message but I was kicking around on the old iPhone last night and uh found out that you can in the notification section if you ... all the way to the bottom there's a a sitting there for amber alerts and emergency alerts and you can turn those off so you can turn off amber alerts\nBut not not the alerts from ... ah yeah heck with the kids but boy female we need to know that one\nOne of our tax dollars wants to know please tell me how I can bounce that text back\n[laughter] if it were a text you could but yes unfortunately you can't ah 'cause like I said it's just an alert that is going to show up but what a weird thing I I guess I mean\nThey said that it's only supposed to be used for national emergencies like nuclear war or sue now me I don't know that we've ever had a mainland sue now me but okay I'm\nIn in in cases like that what's the point of the alert I mean it seems like all that would do is panic everybody good point if it's if it's coming\nClose you know it's like ah what was it was a line from Kentucky Fried movie Moscow and flames missiles headed toward New York film and eleven\n[laughter] another tax there's as if he uses these notifications like Twitter where all do [laughter]\nYou guys are good you should have your own radio shows through in four nine six nine to five eight seven seven or you can text and that aid for one to six so I I don't know I mean I'm I'm tempted to try to turn all of my alerts off just to see if it's still gets through\nYou know I Do have a question now and this is a question I Would like to ask a couple of friends of mine that I don't know how to approach it\nIn the oceans on that one of your friends as well [laughter]\nI mean personal family oh okay yeah\nAnd when the president is so rude\nI mean I don't understand how people reconcile that even if they\nAre his supporters and everything is okay but it just seems so disturbing to me\nTo have that off as anybody in that office whether you support the president or not to be rude and mocking people right we don't want our children to do that and I find it so upsetting\nWhat what what I find bothers him about it is that the excuse that it's often given is well he was like that before people knew what the gas and they voted for him anyway but I don't think that's an excuse I'm with you on this one I don't think that makes it okay to say well we knew who he was\nAnd and he got voted in any way to deal with it no I think they're still such a thing as the gravity of the office\nYeah I I just I Do wonder and I'm asking you all you can text in an age for one to six like how do you reconcile\nI sometimes find it hard to hear what people are trying to say to me if they're being rude and blustery and mocking sure I mean it's hard to hear the message so I Do wonder how\nPeople my friends and family\nWho support him can reconcile that kind of meanness\nYou're assuming there's a message\nAnd\n[laughter] I'm not so sure I got a Saturday I I right exactly and I think that the vote\nIt's also very easy way to conceal a lack of message is if you can do is be rooting blustery well OK anybody can pull that off\nSo if you really have nothing to say well you know you can always revert to being a a defect do stand up insult comic and go back into a you know you go back in the Andrew dice clay mode which is held\nComet comic right I mean it's we have never had that before\nNot as president know so yeah and even\nThe Kavanaugh hearings no matter where you stand on that ah that kind of temperament showing that kind of temperament seems so upsetting\nYou and there's another piece of that that bothers me because Jeff Flake um he's he's a senator he's on the committee everybody knows who he is and the kind of power that he has right now and the fact that he was cornered in this elevator
