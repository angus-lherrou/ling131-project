I mean some incredibly strong wings I mean even where we are and uh to have you know\nMost of our homes here in this particular neighborhood a relatively okay is is still pretty it's pretty awful to have that I mean because they're just less than\nA probably about three blocks away there's a church that's nearby our house and the whole side of that building was ripped off whole side of the church is gone and that's just three blocks from\nRelates he relates a lot to the Midwest tornadoes in relation you can see you know you'll see we're one side of the street to subdivisions gone and the other side of the streets got absolutely no damage yes just yeah it's just amazing how they can be such a fine line and yet so close together\nAnd even even in some of the worst areas said it still is a incredible because you will be driving through um you know where where you'll go blocks of everything's destroy them in one building looks untouched\nAnd and and it's strange um and I don't know and and you know I've noticed a lot of that is newer construction and that food I estimate to to that but some of it isn't and that's just kind of like wow what happened here that that this building could

little disappointed in their choice to to to kind of pull the plug 'em but that said that's that's what they what they decided to do so\nUm you know that's that's [laughter] that's where we are now so as says we're all kind of try to try to rebuild and and and\nGet a holding on on\nWhat's left here uh you know ... what we unfortunately you know there's a ... one of the fortunate ones with the house

it's certainly uh certainly kind of a\nGuy yeah what's that what a punch in the guy\nYeah it really it really doesn't it really doesn't sit well for a lot of us I'm not you know I I I don't want to you know but I don't want to sit there and focus on a two cars so people have lost so much more um but it it really is it really does\nFeel that way and especially if you know for the community here that uh that was kind of hoping that to to have us on and provided information and and kind of get him giving some sense of normalcy or or\nEscape if you will from I'm from some of the things that are

the beach and and you know they're still the beautiful sunsets and the beautiful beach that is a bit left here on their side and and a and a lot of ways it's still very very peaceful that you can find a here so\nI'm well there you go it is it is it's totally devastate has got to take a lot of years to to rebuild everything down here\nYou know it is it is it's totally devastate it's got to take a lot of years to to rebuild everything down here um you know I I Do plan to try and try and stick it out and and and do that and rebuild with everybody here and and find a way to to continue to move on here in the panhandle 'cause I think it is a great community and\nUh you know it's a\nIs there much else is there a strong is there much coming into the area I Know there's all kinds of organizations that\nThey're you know collecting money and food and and trying to help but have you seen any organized is there any organized help I mean is there a corner where you can go and there's a\nYou know a female truck or something that gives you a water or food or I mean or is it pretty healthy or scale have then you've got anybody set up is there any government help actually moving into the area I Know the president's coming down through there what today or tomorrow I think\nYeah he's supposed to be here today uh\nI'll tell you you know what I have seen and I we haven't been to every corner of that they were trying to get in get out of those areas as kind of quickly as possible because the more people that are in there just the harder it is for everybody to to move around the roads are\nYou know you're sharing the road right now with a downed power lines other cars trees\nA debris you know and you're all trying to move around that stuff\nAnd of course that backs things up and makes it was very difficult to to get around [noise] um so but what I've seen is is there there is a lot I mean it it almost at this point now if it every open parking lot where where you can park a vehicle there's there's\nWater stations they're our food stations there are a catering trucks from\nBusinesses a relief organizations churches they're serving meals they're trying to get as much things out as possible um that uh the thing that is truly impressed me is the line men and women that are that are\nPutting the power grid back together and how they are working I mean there's I mean you're talking places that are that are completely destroyed and completely there's nothing there and there's ... and they already have our polls run from miles down the street new polls\nThey clear the old one that put a new polls and run a new line and I mean that it's just incredible to think about how it was the power grid was destroyed to nothing\nAnd it's already a they they're hoping within the next I think it's less than ten days now to have most of that back and that has been the most impressive thing that I've seen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Farmer Dave", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "15"}
