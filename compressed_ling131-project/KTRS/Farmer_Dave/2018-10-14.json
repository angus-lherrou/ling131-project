like muscles make bones stronger keep our arteries clear\nOur mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch for two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor in a sorority on vitamin D he's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy\nOf this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers\nWhen a new vitamin D study is published and he's Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never indoors to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only doors ... advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it and joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thanks mapped out just now I Know that you're ... you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the past\nYear or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be unprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it would give some information about how this evolved\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we followed our doctor's advice and our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood\nSo I started a non profit the vitamin D counsel on that you can read more information than you can possibly remember\nAll about vitamin D and I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within\nThe last year or so I realize that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors it needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to it\nNeeds for on it needs magnesium it needs sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it\nOr taking the wrong preparation\nCan learn about it and that's a big difference so I approach the number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is Curtis off for about a complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't put it on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled for sure\nAnd let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case vitamin D can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\n... that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off a list of headlines\nWhen you think about it is truly amazing\nAnd ... these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nAre Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time\nNeglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk am a news that's American Medical association or listen to this that by them indeed the fish and the maybe the root\nOf numerous health problems that the American Medical Association or you know it's just truly amazing the reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure hell\nAll breast health own health cognition blood pressure health immune health all these different things as because vitamin D ... if not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet because it's not a vitamin ... it's made in the skin\nUpon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made as a steroid hormone no steroid hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid hormones and the way they work that is the key there are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes much vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it unlocks\nNow these are things you can experience the now\nPoint does it what does it do to your fingernails grow quicker\nThey become harder they become less critical really shiny or it's really a remarkable changing your finger no but it takes more than a month because it takes about six months for the finger nails to grow up [noise] but these are things we can see and feel vitamin D. effects thirty six Oregon so wow I Can't feel what it's doing and you're paying ...\n[laughter] you know what it's doing for your blood pressure yeah you know or your prostate but we don't have time to talk about these thirty six Oregon but what we're talking about is the immune system\nThe pancreas heart blood pressure muscle spraying brain activity prostate health breast health colon health bone marrow teeth in gums kidney alone retina skin\nStomach uterus I mean I could go on but again because activated vitamin D is a steroid hormone\nIt can affect all these Oregon's because there's two thousand genes that it is the key to those genes and it depends upon which Oregon it is and which gene is involved so there's two thousand mechanism of action\nVery important to understand because you know we'd been jaded with vitamin claims vitamin C. vitamin either going to feel better you're going to do this you're going to its cetera and so people find it hard to believe I mean and defied them and they only did one thing they find it easier to believe but they just have to remember the mechanism of action which is unique to any vitamin\nYou mentioned Colin healthier my family physician as a precautionary move will be on a pretty healthy dose of vitamin D what's the connection\nYeah well the reason you're gastroenterologist did that is because there's just a wealth of studies now that are coming out showing that coal and health and vitamin D levels are connected but at the same studies about breast tell the same studies about prostate though\nThis is like an insurance policy not to not to take this and it's just freak you go in\nAnd the other thing I Want to say as though you're listening in five years I don't want you to say I didn't know about this I was never told I mean five years from now I don't want you to turn around and say I didn't know about I Wish I would've known because you've been polled at right now you're being told you know you can't say\nYou never you never knew about it because I'm telling you right now it's involved for example in a number of places in the country if you walk into the emergency room\nWith anything that might be your heart you know what they do\nGet a hundred thousand units right off the bat first thing on thousand years of vitamin D day and then they keep giving\nThem and tell us your question speaking of the cardiovascular system and I know you could probably talk for about thirty minutes on this but some of the information you sent me you're just fascinating vitamin D does talk about his role in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system\nAnd same clues we know the heart health is better the closer you lifted the equator we know heart health is better in the summer than the winter but just recently there have been a slew of studies out of the best universities in the world all connecting your vitamin D level\nTo your heart health there's a study for example out of Harvard by a friend of mine professor Edward given each he and his conclusion was pretty stark there it is quote low levels of vitamin D or associated with higher risk integrated\nMan even after controlling for a known risk factors that is even after they control for smoking high blood pressure high triglycerides diabetes all the things known to contribute even after they control for that there was a ... wrong effect of vitamin D day\nAnd it was integrated manner that is if you're really deficient than your risk is much higher if you're a little deficient than your risk is a little higher and we don't have enough studies you have to say that you know if you have heart disease you should take vitamin D\nAlthough many cardiologist their prescribing it just on the basis of why not it is safe you know five thousand units a day it cannot make anybody toxic five thousand years the day it's ten minutes of summer show either five minutes this summer gun shy so the way these doctors are thinking is look what the\nRisk versus what the benefits it looks like from the studies there is a tremendous risk associated with vitamin D deficiency we don't have all the studies we need and we're doing those studies now but it would be unethical to let people\nOh this study is we need and we're doing the study is now but it would be unethical to let people remain vitamin D deficient while we're conducting all the studies we need to about heart health or bone health or press tell the prostate health their immune system\nIt would be unethical to let them white vitamin D deficient the problem is that many doctors use antiquated reference ranges and so if you're a level of thirty five they'll tell you that's okay it's not okay [noise] level needs to be fifty or higher and to get that adults need five thousand units a day\nAgainst those just tuned in I mentioned earlier you know I go through the health food store looking multi vitamins most the best have four hundred I use I mean when you're looking at the the vitamin D that you can buy by itself as a stand alone vitamin most or four hundred I use I saw a couple that were a thousand a huge apples but again that falls far short\nOf that five thousand number and that's what you get was purity here why is that so important\n[noise] there's recently been a study by professor Hany at ... university that shows that when you get your level to fifty\nYour body has enough for all the things that needs to do and it begins to store a little bit of the vitamin D just like your ancestors you the story\nSo if your level is less than fifty your body is basically using up all the vitamin D as fast as you take it for all the things that need to think of vitamin D day as a mountain spring with a pool at the top right the pool we've always known about its calcium and bone\nAnd we've taken enough item in data halfway fill up that calcium and bone pool\nBut all the other polls below with the breath pool the cold and pull the immune system poll all the other polls that are below it had been basically dry since we've been out of the sun right if you take five thousand units of vitamin D\nThe upper pool overflowed starts filling in all the pools at the bottom the teeth and gum the mood to cognition the pancreas out all these pools\nAnd there's enough left over to store a little bit for a rainy day\nAnd a little bit of a surplus yet but you don't do that unless you're levels around fifty if you're levels less than around fifty you used up almost all of it immediately and that's called chronic substrate starvation well and that's not a good thing\nBy the way down to a ... D super formula is not available in stores only directly through purity products you get it in conjunction with their omega three fish oil the free bottled fish oil both of these are thirty\nDays supplies and all you pay for shipping four Ninety five you can't beat it the phone number one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero that's one eight hundred six five zero six eight to zero now to talk to me about the link between vitamin D in body weight what's the research showing\nWell that is maybe ... studies out there that show real simple association the lower your vitamin D the more you weigh the higher your vitamin D the less you with but that doesn't prove that it's a cause and effect but there were clues think lose that we know about mood that is\nPeople who live closer to the equator way less than people who live far away from their quick people who live at higher altitude closer to the sun way less than people who live at lower altitudes most people experience as people way less than the summer\nThan they do in the winter so those were closed\nBut we don't need those clothes anymore because the explanation of why your vitamin D level is so what we call inversely associated with your weight that is the higher your vitamin D levels ... that's become clear just recently for example there's a paper in the British Journal of nutrition August of last year they studied women who were dieting\nAnd the women who had the highest vitamin D and takes lost more weight than the women who had the lower vitamin D ... yes and then just\nA couple of months ago a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial that's the highest standard of proof we have in medicine is was thirty six thousand people and they just gave them a tiny doses of vitamin D day so we don't have any idea what the full effect is\nBut the women who were taking even this tiny doses of vitamin D were less likely to gain weight than the women who were not take while adamant day\nSo that's another reason plots\nSince purity is giving away a month's supply of this formula vitamin D formula plus the fish or\nYou know of course that there's research that shows that fish or in a self help with weight control so there's reasons to believe that two things together will help now it's not a diet tail is not dramatic he won't just stopped eating part of that that is you just feel better you're more active you are under doing something\n[noise] now don't you know we're sort of run out of time here but I I Want to give you a few minutes tell people why you believe is so vitally important did they give this formula try\n[noise] well you know we've had time to talk about the heart body weight mood but you know we haven't had time really to talk about brain health coal and health press tell prostate health pancreatic health bone health the immune system\nI could go on and on the main reason that people will continue to take this if you just give it a try for a month is how you feel you're get up and go you're feeling of wellbeing that's what you noticed now if you take it for several months or year\nYou'll notice a lot of different changes in your doctor will notice a lot of different changes in your dentist will notice a lot of different changes\nThank you so much for joining us today I Want to get that special offer one more time surety products aim recognize leader in the field of evidence based nutritional solutions\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way other symptoms I could look for that would tell me Patty you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a real for so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system out kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic feel will talk about that later I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're\nJust not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they'd been fishing for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think and then we move is normal\nYeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S [noise]\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and it if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nLet me ask you there so when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity product shooting at five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\n[laughter] yeah that's probably the first thing that they'll notice there's an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by well being I I just mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month\nA month to month where you you know you get up and go was\nGone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low and and that's one of the first thing that and the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the close we have for heart healthy are going to talk about that later but\nBut people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mode hire you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude that you live at the better your mode\nAnd mood improved in the summertime so mood improved in the summertime and the worst things in the wintertime that those were clues that vitamin D was somehow involved but just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this spot and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people\n[noise] this is what they found they found that people with\nThe lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Randall nice at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out was their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nTo make you feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month yeah let me let me get this special offer 'cause I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nYou've also asked them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get and they seem to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good how are you paying for shipping the shipping deals pretty good [noise]\nYeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again in this special form of vitamin K expensive foreign vitamin K to it needs that bore on and I want it to be patented bore on and it needs magnesium and the need to think\nAnd we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic play\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty capsules\nAnd a bottle of molecularly distilled ultra cure fish or I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laughed and they said okay I Will do it then and they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more [laughter]\nBut then I said you know I don't want any Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want even a nine Ninety five shipping and handling when you get\nLess than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and
