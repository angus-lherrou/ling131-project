crashing you add\nYour wife basically leaves you and you decide to follow that dream of doing comedy in each one happens on the way when the comedy shows me opening and the waitresses and\nDelivers the whole deal which I imagine it's pretty easy to write the road you teach in real life\nIt's nice to have my own experiences as the threats through three seasons because we can always look back and go like okay what was terrible\nAnd what can we look back on those terrible things and make them funny for people here I haven't yet seen a show about a fan of\nThat really takes them in slow motion through what is actually like to start as a comedian shows about comedy that I Love you know the comedians are already working and they're and they're making they're paying their bills and and the kind of like an afterthought\nWhere like but what if we showed an open Mike\nIs really like what if we show you what it's like they had a fire is what if we show you what it's like to do warm up for for daytime television these different ideas\nOr I'm so happy that we got the first crack out some\nWould see a dying breed I think it's an extinct species on a leash comedy time does you're going away and do some loan provided some pretty great stories having seen a few myself\nOf course I Know my front comedy condo within Milwaukee and I remember I was like they always say don't use the I I\nMean [noise]\nIt wasn't a blank foot they're always like there's always some prankster doing something to with or around the ice that you don't want to use it\nWas just on their speed on the carpet blood\nDo of course there's blood and there there was literally was pornography under the ... that is weird condoms in drawers and it was it was disgusting disgusting play especially 'cause my character on crashing which I gather he pointed out is very similar debate with a religious guy\nNot comfortable going into the smoke filled drunks nightclubs and wasn't trying to have sex with waitresses are when his wife leaves any kind of has to go out and figure it out for the first time\nIt's quite a dengue fever in the world of comedy and I think that's where we find a lot of the comedy\nShows do you turn to a lot of up and comers just find out what it's like beyond the way up to now because you've already\nYeah I mean we are telling the story sometimes we we smart some details because we are telling the story of what it was like for me to come up\nSome things change but a lot of things that are still the same uh when I eat when we're now shooting I Walk past all the guys handing out flyers we all say hello and we talk about the show now\nBecause you know that hasn't changed it's been a I guess it's been Fifteen Years in fact about ten years um which is crazy but it happens and people still\nDo warm up and you know the condos might be going away but the feeling of going to a club for the first time and seeing and and not knowing what you're doing that never goes away so we're trying to hit some of those universal things that are really wacky and strange about doing stand up\nI was going to be home show and that was produced by Conan in about\n... which seemed to me for you\nYou can't be beat homes and you know it seemed like there was a lot of off the cuff ad lib and ... if you wanted to mention meaning views you know whatever you wanted to play now you're kind of the confines of the script and do show show compared the two\nYeah you're absolutely right you know something that Conan said first of all I'm Glad you're a fan of that means a lot ah when we were doing a talk show you 'cause you're in the volume does it's like you're Indiana Jones running away from the Boulder\nYou're always trying to fail them back to the next episode the next episode so there's not a lot of times too or polish or naval days or even really look back you're always just about the next episode\nAnd there's a certain adrenalin rush to that it was so fun to do you really get not rhythm when you're performing a lot and you just kinda that's what led to all the improv and all that for a faith and you also got to do is get if you thought of that\nKind of was like being a kid on a playground and in fact I'd put Conan Patty was like don't look at it as a job he was like look at it as something you go out and everyone watches you play on a playground and try to have fun with it um but now you know doing this show is pretty different it's very very different you write the script\nThank you how are we really appreciate it\nSure does a little bit about what's going on today who should we not only an episode ... coming up in a very special one\nGets really cool you know what we're making history on love connection is our first same sex episode uh so I mean\nWe've got a woman named lists doctor from California we are setting up with three women and spoiler alert she's trying to walk and uh it's a really cool\nIn ground breaking up to the show and it's the second person I suffer so darn it ate your time on Fox\nAnyhow and choose how do people get chosen for this show\nYou know what I'm I was frankly the honest with you at nothing to do with how they're going to show up we thought that they got thousands of submissions from people who wanted to be\nOn the show and set up as a you know it was the first lesbian we've ever had on Life Love connection and got sick we couldn't have picked a better person that bought she can credibly like the whole silly beautiful and a great day\nWhere you see them I mean when you were were you sitting there watching one connection\nHere I used to watch it with my parents are I think it was syndicated said it was either I think it was All right after the local news young growing up we used to watch us a call\nAnd I love that I absolutely love the original and this is you know it's so fun for me to be able to work with\nMy wife to produce a bachelor and might start out was produced American Idol or about that that day we invent if you believe that frankly didn't really have much reinvention because it just works about the cutter said she says behind first they said it was\nHot it's about human behavior really caught it\nShe can then seeing Jesus\nStatus drive the\nWay I mean when you're getting involved in something like that then you should do for insurance didn't need a whole lot of reinvention but what did you specifically want to bring to it was it wasn't there may be in the original luge you wanted to make specifically any going\nI think you're seeing myself you know look I didn't really uniting Real Housewives for the last ten years I insert myself into the conversation and I like to have fun and I like to see on below fend off there was something great about ... what was it was just like\nYou said that he he he didn't really get in there and I think I push a little harder and I I get my hands dirty you know\nThe I don't understand why you never wanted to do Real Housewives of the new Institute because you you know living here\nFor you know what if they're shooting first of all I mean I've seen the show for much of my life to you it's a little less exciting to you\n... you ever the expression like do where you\nKnow\nI didn't want to be able to go I go home\nTo St Louis for Thanksgiving every year like I don't really mean that\nThe drama or the struggle or

that if you want to call it that later on in my life I think I got famous what I was a ...\nYou know like late thirties early forties and so I can sit around famous people for years before that and I was already kind of stop was the first that I was not I was kind of\nGood St Louis boy from school so becoming famous sit not turn into a monster I don't think I mean you can opt\nOut there saying I\nThink of a box of pretty OK guys cells and so um you know I take it all with a grain of salt and as far as my friend Anderson Cooper always says that I enjoy being famous more than other people I tell them\nIt's because it happened to be late in life so now the idea that I don't have to wait in lines or I can get into a restaurant you know what to me if I enjoy that\nYou know Andy do you think St Louis has gained family\nUm you know what I have not willing to live there as an out gay laugh so I couldn't tell you\nThat I Know that I've spoken with the cardinals organization and I knew that I Know that they're doing a first ever a kind of game of the ballpark which I'm really excited to hear that they're doing because it's happening in a few other cities throughout the years\nAnd um you know I just I find St Louis the little segregated when I go there I'm ethnically racially and not just serves me and I can't speak to what it's\nLike to be a gay and St Louis or you know you know I'm certainly embrace put on there and I I certainly would like to think that it's that it's a you know that it's that it's good to be gay they're like I don't know anything\nTo lose you're willing to get
