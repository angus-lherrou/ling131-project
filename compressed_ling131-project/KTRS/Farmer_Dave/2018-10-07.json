like Europe fully realized human but now that you told me that I can kind of tell you that you've been in there how long you been in the long your brother texted me to be nice to you that you and I knew a\nYeah you said you'll see my sister be nice\nAnd he did he called me today and he said that you guys were buddies I did not know that I Know that just been on the set up a with a girl yes\nBut I met him probably the first time a couple of years ago when he did big slick because even poll rub your way back when they do so that's the first time I met him and then a couple more times than that you had a show on HBO or Showtime or something like that\nThat didn't go wild we talked about that too he said maybe we don't bring that now\nWe do pay I I I watch television counties are still here with\nJoe your inspiration that way for a anchorman\nIf I said that it would be a compliment that left eight because because remember and Joe's competent quite good way to share doesn't even know much about sports that your hair though\nIn what made them on your head\nAll right Joe ... it's in this book called lucky bastard that it makes a minute to catch up right about Venus book did you write about you how to keep it All right well maybe this is the second edition of the book\nThe second ... will be called a love story I went to a tipped in right now that I see anything with your name on it\nYeah my brother's a business still they're checking manufacturing but what about like a bench in a park or home of David tombstones in the cemetery was by parents names on 'em so there's character but you don't want to be on that yet no no we're just saying if something like my name on it you went to the full David Kuttner question\nWill sit one big country hit you drive to Pocahontas a and there's a giant home of ... this is where you know David kick their tip didn't memorial stadium something you know\nNo not yet do you want us to make\nSome calls are dumb look if you start a campaign I'm not going to stop you made a different job I could do it right on that was one phone call yeah discovered he get all of that maybe don't match it on the air well this season\nI don't want to be nice to you for some reason but I um I was reading about everything you do in Kansas City the charity work and the the\nActors and friends that you call a plan to help out there and you probably don't want this out there either or you're very philanthropic person to do a lot of good things why not what the cause you kind of have this time of tough guy image and you're really Pussy cat [laughter]\nAnd having kids and kids often most affected by this having five kids of your own and doing this [noise] was that we're here are you able to separate those I'm just doing a movie this is just a scenario in a plot of a film like oh my God that could happen to my job\nThat can happen and that's partly why did it be because you know you want to bring awareness that human trafficking is a huge problem in every major city it's it happens here this is a hub St Louis has a hobby yeah because it makes yeah horrible perfect sense because you're centrally located\nAnd uh just government might you know your city might not have the resources to go after those types of crimes and they are a lot of the times on the radar and a lot of people around them and this conception that\nAh these young ladies consent to those type of work when most of the time certainly when they're younger they are absolutely not they're just brought in and and slaves in the human trafficking business [noise]\nSo yeah and I start working with an organization called children the night and they got rescue girls from the ages of ... new to Seventeen I Know does that that hurt so bad and a lot of the girls was kidnapped and a friend of mine was telling me a story where it's now become a huge problem though just grab rules out of pocket watch\nMy God yeah it's a it's a it's a bigger business than drugs in this country is the movie still available priceless I'm sure you can download it you know\nWhen you do something with such a heavy theme when the body of your work is largely comedy and the way you're obviously wired is it difficult to pull that part of David sprain out of the picture when you're trying to do something so dramatic\nYou work a little harder because it's a different muscle that's for sure in terms of you know you're not trying to land a joke right you're trying to performance so it takes more investigation on your part\nYou know can you hear people say about comedy is is you know dying is easy comedy is hard right but for people that are naturally humorists and it's not as hard as you would think but to be dramatic I Would think would be an even bigger challenge\n... yeah it can be in this case by case we've all seen people that have tried to make that transition and to varying degrees of success\nWhy'd you look at me when you said that I thought you know our independent but you have when you said people are trying to figure out what the heck are trying to be funny trying to have a soul yet his eyebrows you can't see it under the cowboy hat which is where he but his eyebrows\nWhen he said what people are trying to be funny but I wasn't really thinking I was trying to think it'd be clear and articulate without hinting that I was talking about any particular actor\nDavid you're Antronette called me earlier I Love your Jeanette yes she's listening right now uh-huh she's a big fan of our show too that's nice so she wanted me Paso solo Jeanette works there the boys and\nGirls Club oh ... of St Louis tell your nephew I'm naturally funny\n[laughter] [noise] ... get a phone call from her now or do we wait or who will wait\nI did have one more little gym beers and I read some way competed as to who the hell knows if it's real big Lou Reed fan yeah oh yeah Michael and purely only yes to already know what I'm going though I don't from the Sopranos uh-huh I\nGot a new movie out that he's in which is what brought him to the show he also just released his first novel about a kid in the seventies growing up in New York City loosely based on him\nBut it's a novel because you take some liberties and part of the liberties that he takes his his best friend because he lives in the same apartment building just the guy is Lou Reed\nWow that's pretty cool so a lot of connect the dots there I Can't think of the name of the book but if you are a big fan that might be an interesting race for yeah than parents who she wrote a novel\nYes that's an interesting in and of itself I can barely says last day but I don't know why it's probably a lot of pictures ... yes yes that's really the way to go it's just like one sentence per\nPage we had um their home on the show nice and uh he was chatting with Carney\nWas funny naturally I live in no way and I am in tone or articulation have accused you of not being for the I think you're being paranoid Lou that era hall\nSays in the eighties he would hang out with people in New York but like Lou Reed and Patti Smith and all that and they would all ask each other what they were doing or what are you working on Lou I'm Patty what do you work in a nobody as Daryl\nWhat he was working with a sense but I think he was okay with it because you know he seems a lot different songs and measure that he did pop pop music yeah blue eyed so yeah\nWhich is ... is he still does not like I'm thirty two little weekly jam or something to do is live from Daryl so yeah I think it's which networks a couple of where where is it now I you know it was not HGTV one but I maybe it's on access now mark Cuban's spicy but we're we're located\nUpstate New York right near Woodstock yeah a couple of members the band used to do it as well\nAh you bribery Robertson spans is that what you're talking about the other guy for biking on his name or his who I Am yes or no the one of the leaves singers from the band the drummer who died you know he's on about how we let him\nYes there we go we solve a lot of he's dead now but he's not how much of beer stand up is about your entertainment career about entertainment and on about your career because people want to know a few minutes we'll affair or like a ... yeah but I don't ever tell those types of stories well here's the thing everyone is nice\nIn all honesty doesn't work no it's not it's less interesting can you make it up and say corral is such an [noise] no I wouldn't want to do that because I Will do that yeah that's fine\nBut I wouldn't confuse the front of mine and naturally funny either to resort to where you go yeah I've got plenty of material that I don't need to see how people wouldn't would love to hear anecdotes about famous people but that's just not my style of at a book on a biography coming down the pike\nNot anytime soon now know why\nI mean he started raising turkey snow now you're in show business or my father built livestock trailers\nI'm close to you okay very good I Would does teach you to read every set I admire your your preparation sort of well it's good to have your neck you\nKnow we have to tape it David kept there I Know it's it's a fascinating story and one would wonder you know it's not like it's not like scouts come from Hollywood the Tipton, Missouri to check out the talent pool true they still are not scouting there are\nTwo ... two lines of how you got from tip into wearing a\nTo launch a Chicago second city it problematic [laughter] that was very cool and it was like\nWords what's the process like to get in the second city because you came up when corral wasn't there and Glenn or cold there and there were a lot of those Amy Poehler create our early ...\nAnd are cold there and there were a lot of those you Amy\nPoehler criminal early added Myers area you would have had you know a pause sans ... really early that that was fifty eight well either that or are they all we see in ... big group of valid yup yup just sign up\nNo no you got to take classes to classes and then you eventually audition for what's called the tour and company and then from the Turing company are chosen chosen to be on one of the main one of the resident companies\nWhat was your edition do you remember for the second city that I could say that we just had to supervise do you remember what you did know now\nSo I watched that on line and um the uh improv at second city because my niece Natalie was at second city\nFor last summer the summer before\nAnd I got to tell you that watching the stream of that was very awkward yeah can you just ... they're not really that cheese and yet they and they were just they were still skewed moly I knew people that kind of know what's going on and then some of them had no idea and embrace this hard unless you know what\nYou're doing it is hard but because you do you do need to get out of your own way and listen it's can be as simple as a conversation you don't have to try to be funny if you have to try to be honest and ... and remember what the what was the last set to rather than just going off on the story is still has to be the about the relationship the two people\nThat make sense you know she said you don't have to try to be funny just for a split second really in the back of your getting them to go to the United body cameras rolling anybody on any that no you pack the livestock\nTrailer and went to Chicago a that's basically going to be in the autobiography I Can't reveal that you had\nTo lie start actually drove a Ford Escort pack everything I had a Ford Escort yes quite deliberately obviously\nI stayed at the Chicago YMCA for um three weeks is we've got a place this book material but then when it works out there you know she worked at the YMCA or something that's where we're at I Will\nTell you I I was home a cow at night yes needed towels wants came home at night and there was a man standing right outside the elevator naked\nCopying his manhood and it it should be kept and so I wasn't used to the big cities that can help is is it what's normal so to speak clearly wasn't holding a gun well hey go by\nThat well not that kind of guy so that's the first time you're ... will Farrell is that we are in the idea that ... I knew there'd be stores so you're going to do shows I guess tomorrow night also committed to it how we do and I take it she got to rooms or any of it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Farmer Dave", "city": "Saint Louis", "day": "07"}
