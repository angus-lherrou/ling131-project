taken out of supermarkets sales from all sorts of ...\nIt was and he said there are big and little bites being taken out of the supermarket sales from all sorts of things including the fact that Americans are eating out more\nPeople are getting more action from home to Michigan\nYes agriculture department research economist Abigail\n... she and her colleagues had just finished doing over sales data from Nineteen Ninety set it up to twenty Seventeen updating the data sources improving the process adding more data and she says not only are we spending more and more of our food dollar at restaurants and such but we are actually spending more of our food budget\nEating out and then buying groceries the old day that had that first happening in ... fourteen but now the new more comprehensive data shows that\nShare in the United states away from home cooked food at home and overturned\nSunny ten years earlier than everybody thought and\nThis is so even those shoppers are continuing to spend a larger share of their food dollar buying groceries for home preparation warehouse clubs and super centers those stores are grabbing all those twenty percent of our home food dollar compared to six point six percent Twenty years ago so supermarkets\nTraditional grocery stores are the ones getting hurt most by our increasing purchases of food from restaurants and\nGrocery store I share food at home has really declined line like pulling for anyone point for the food at home back up ... points for work\nSo eight Thirteen percent drop now some businesses can see their market share shrink but sales go up anyway because of higher prices or overall growth in demand but Abigail Okrent says very little of that is going on for restaurants now yes average grills in sales over each of the last Twenty years has been about two percent\nFor the people have grown at the same amount that they actually hit the kind of real fat grocery store quaint\nSales of food restaurants though going up any way you look at it and so for supermarket that opening songs is\nAllowed to say I recall very for the U.S department of agriculture was saying to\nYourself eating out more than you did being five years ago ten years ago when do you ever go to the grocery store or do you eat out every night yeah but we eat out a lot too because we're both very busy so\nVery busy as you are a yeah
