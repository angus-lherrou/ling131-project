updated Bronx you bond of Missouri corn growers association and Missouri corn merchandising council ... host Michel Columbus this week we talk with Missouri corn Samantha Davis the associate director of public policy will talk about proposition be coming up on the Missouri ballots regarding transportation talk with Samantha in just a moment\nWe're out two or three years in a row every winner of America's a legal term\nMorning by every major both manufacture aging in America\nBetter for the environment in powering England who wants to narrow the truth about him and all\nAgain Samantha Davis is our guest and Samantha it's election season as folks will head of the bowls and just a couple of weeks in Missouri voters will consider proposition the regarding transportation so Samantha tell us what does this proposition do for the state yeah Michael\nThank you so much for having me and that's a great question you know folks the attack increase on something on the ballot and they're immediately a little bit leery of it\nSo we want to get the word out about the benefits that proposition D. and why it's so important for it to pass on November thick vaguely you think about the fuel tax Missouri last time the fuel taxes raised with twenty two years ago in Nineteen Ninety six\nSo we've obviously had lots and lots of changes and and what the value of Seventeen sent field accent only seven cents a value today given inflation so those dollars just aren't going as far as they had before\nIt's important to note that Missouri has the seventh largest road system and the forty nine so low in fuel tax in the country the only state that has a lower fuel taxing us as Oklahoma\nAnd that simply because they had a lot more toll roads to make up for that income disparity\nWe also importantly have the sixth largest bridge system twelve hundred and bridges and the state or wait restricted and more than nine hundred are rated poor\nSo we'll get that perspective for agriculture we're worried about getting our products to market and getting them to a place where we can tell them getting in the rivers that rail system and you know at their weight restricted bridges in a way that slows down I think we have to burn more fuel to get around\nOn a different way so they're recording or an association decided to endorse this proposition because we've seen\nThe road system had just started to carry it time to take the action is time to make the change that we can maintain our infrastructure so we can get to the marketplace\nNo of course all of this the stands to benefit for proposition ... but let's look at those rural farm areas specifically how can farmers out there in the fields stand to benefit from this\nProposition will make a big difference for rural areas and for farmers the way the constitution laid out how many can they spent specifically says it can be sent on roads and bridges on the cost of the highway patrol and its enforcement and then simply the state cost there collecting that fuel tax\nAnd then also the formula specifically laid out that there is a local split already in the constitution portion of these funds are specifically designated to go to county and city\nAnd that formula is not just based on population which would obviously benefit urban areas more it is based on population and rode mile fill in Israel areas where we have lots of road miles they're going to benefit more formula wise and get better percentage of this money\nSamantha also included in the propositions funding for the highway patrol what does that component due in regards of improving public safety for urban and rural areas like\nThat's a great question I Know I've heard several people last like okay why is headed patrol tied in with is like I mentioned the way the formula designate that says that the cost of the show is part of that formula but it's important to know that the way that this new proposition is written it kind of creates an additional lane for highway patrol funding\nBut it's still subject to appropriation by the legislature and that free that those other dollars\nThat had been used to pay for the head of the trouble to support our roads and bridges infrastructure that we so desperately need\nSomebody up as we wrap up any final thoughts on proposition ... ready to head to the polls\nWell Michael Steele remember back with me I Believe it was twenty fourteen that was the last attempt to to raise money for infrastructure in our state and then kind of failed miserably and at that time at that time they were looking at doing sales tax increase what's great about proposition ... that the ... almost a user fee the ones that you are oh they're going to pay for it and a lot of times and other people\nThat are crossing our state whether they're tourists or whether they're truckers and do that money's going to come from multiple sources that way and that way we're going to make sure that we have the infrastructure in place in Missouri forward hopefully several people have seen that Governor person and that was governor he was kind of hit the road in support and this\nAlso had literally pork association and the military so it'd be an association that cattle and association Farm Bureau and NSA oil have all come out and supported us because they also acknowledge we've got to have that in the structure in place to support our
