C. R. at\n\n\nThe border and maybe a little vacation that you set up a while back with some of the moms\nAnd she'll be back on Monday barring any kind of green cards and we do know\nDay by the way I'm Seventy four years ago a U.S troops waded through the water on the beaches of Normandy\nUm you know\nAnd I was there I was there and I had seen the movie with Tom Hanks a saving private Ryan have you seen the movie yeah yeah did you could maybe I did\nThat because I'm usually from and right now actually\nYou're really one of the most credible opening scene\nThe just the sheer violence of\nThe unloading of those men\nOn that beach was just\nI had the opportunity about ten years ago\nGo to France we actually went there to play golf\nBut and we played a big golf course right there at a um Normandy Omaha Beach\nAnd after the [noise]\nThe guy was leading us to do you guys want to take a tour\nYou know the the inter beach and about half of us said yes\nAnd I'm so glad that I was one of them to do that because we walked down\nThe um this pathway tradition overlook the beach itself\nMiles and miles and miles long [noise]\nAnd what was remarkable is that it seemed like it may have been a quarter of a mile from where we're standing to the edge of the water I mean it was back in time and you know it was filled with\nBarbed wire and um you know I get it yet\nBarbed wire and um you know ... and yet the blockades for the tanks you know those big steel Texas they put out there and land mines and God Knows what else uh as as the allied forces stormed the beaches there\n[noise] um [noise]\nA\nGuy who was with us she was French uh spoke English very well and she was explaining to us\nThe where the the gun tourists were and um there was a a curious of marking in the ground that was sort of a\nKind of an ass looked like a scar an ass and I said what is that what the ... you know those were serpent teen trenches that the Germans had dug their mhm so uh they could make their way\nSo was there an implicit assumption given that the whole world but Hillary Clinton was going to be elected president\nAnd the answer is sure that's possible maybe even likely\nBut it wouldn't change the decision I still had to crappy options to choose from\nBut one was much worse than the other no matter what the poll said I could speak about something or I could hide something from the American people well hiding something from the American people basically lying to them is never the right answer and so I'd have spoken no matter who was going to be the next president\nUh the emails on I'm Anthony wiener is a laptop why not investigate that first find out if those are different emails and then say something why say you're opening it up before you knew what was on the laptop\nYou that's a that's a really good question and a reasonable person might have decided to take the chance\nTo investigate a little and see what you have the reason that didn't make sense to me is that first of all the the investigators were telling me this hundreds of thousands of emails on Anthony Clinton's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop including possibly the missing emails from her first three months the secretary of state which\nRun a different domain and we can't possibly review these before the election is just too many and so do you wait given that and then there's another consideration we'd had a problem with leaks what if it leaks out the friday before the election that you've been doing this secretly\nIn some ways that's worse if worst can be imagined that's worse and so my judgment is that would not be a smart move but I could also see people saying that this\n[noise]\nThis is the best of ... live in the morning here is ... have on the [noise]\nThe director of a study that came out\nCalled Missouri twenty thirty Ted welcome back big five fifty ...\nThis was developed by the Missouri department or the excuse me the Missouri chamber foundation on and it said what was the goal of this study what did you ... what what did you want to look at\nWell there are or how about a black workers are trying to make it easier for people over\nThe number one issue I here talking to businesses big and small tech companies regular companies restaurants you name it the number one issue businesses have today is that they can find qualified workers\nAgree with you we hear that all over the country everywhere we businesses are looking for a full scale productive individual on the job so happy with what\nIs it because the jobs are menial labor and Americans quote unquote don't like to do those jobs is it is it they're tech jobs that they don't have the skills for what's the what's the underlying problem there\nI Wish there was one thing but it's not just the job that will still now we're seeing black drivers a lack of mechanics swelled the in the\n... the job well we just figured out how to act skills\nSo these are these are good paying jobs\nBut some of them up to six figure jobs that many good job\nAnd you would think that supply and demand right would sort of fulfill that problem over a number of years\nBut there was a lot of issues that come with this we have a lot of baby boomers affects\nThe labor market so a lot of people with skills overtime or leaving young people are moving into the change of industries and jobs that I make it harder for you know what they should\nDo what they should be [noise] then you have jobs that are moving around the country state of Missouri\nThen you have jobs that are moving around the country around the state of Missouri [noise] so where did I find a job\nYou know what I mean that I Want those skills and find a job but I'm looking for and so what the study tries to do a lot of things one different acts of\nState of Missouri needs to take sector and the public sector job making that point\nDid how much of it is there just aren't the bodies were not a growing population\nIt's a big issue or ... years ago everybody in America and everybody was talking about the quality is still but at the job market appointment as rains almost historical was all\nThe water the rabbit your baby these days we were before coming into the marketplace so demand is so real real testified before they get Missouri specifically attracting keeping young people in the state to have good skill\nThere's a real issue in the plant addresses that about trying to retain and attract\nI Know there I can hear them screaming at the radio right now ... McGraw ask them about tech schools vocational schools and high school is great and it's great to learn\nFrench and Latin and about the great Gatsby about Scott Fitzgerald is but we're not teaching them skills that employers need so where did the high schools getting into all this\nHigh school have to be there and back when you're bored and how they get you high schools are part of it were saying ... or more career education but you can't give up everything when you talk to order they want people\nWith basic academic skill they want people would still like ... people with the skills are merging and more than anything else on what's going to hear from hoarders if you think you still need all of that education but we we\nTalk about a little much anymore and we need it to the horse or some of the nation let's start with them or to be more more and more engaged\nIn middle there's got to be a balance there are some people are working\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThirty one grams of sugar per serving such crazy and that's because they're removing the fiber in the process that they use their concentrating the sugar what we do ... is the exact\nOpposite where the hydrate and the greens at low temperatures for maintaining all the goodness of fiber is there a fighter nutrients the antioxidants the vitamins and minerals the plant and sometimes it's all there one serving a purity organic juice cleanse it was only forty five calories and that's because all the fiber is\nStill there remember this is made from real organic produce all we're doing is removing the water at low temperatures block and all the good and as you can taste it you can taste the organic fruits and vegetables berries you just add water shake it up and the free shaker cup get it into your system and it goes to work helping your\nRight what about the science behind these certified organic super fruits and vegetables found in the organic juice ... what does the science say about getting seven nine servings of fruits and greens per day how important is that to consume those on a regular basis and what percentage of us really gives enough\nBut look at my patient base I Would say maybe it's one out of twenty seven to nine maybe I'm wrong maybe it's one out of fifty I rarely see it\nAnd the problem with that is that the science is crystal clear path to study is by the thousands are done and the results are in bottom line if you eat more\nFruits and vegetables whole fully seven to nine servings a day you're going to support\nYour focus your concentration definitely your energy your skin will look better helps the eyes the brain digestion elimination it's going to support your liver pat and its job of cleansing of the talks to find your system also fruits and vegetables\nThey're powerfully antioxidant plus they ... the body that's so important world to asset and that causes a legion of calcium from the bone so by our allies in the body to support your bone health listen if you're a fifty\nPlus ... like me and you notice that maybe your energy isn't the same if this sounds a little bit familiar to you and you're not getting seven to nine servings fruits and veggies so this is one of the main reasons you're feeling this way and that's where O.
