tragic each day that we saw unfold on TV [noise]\nSeventy four people killed Twenty one kids killed\nThe building burning down\nIn all those folks\nBasically burned alive\nA couple of them got out one is David ... who wrote Waco a survivor story who joined us on the program and do you tell you that we're looking at something a quarter of a century ago\nWhat does that feel like you or is it just like it was yesterday\nDavid oh that was the actual question that was one that you're a very very hard to follow your lungs when that's okay because when it was funny it was so long ago which was at times were seems like it was forty five years\nYeah they're they're tired of the like you know Fifteen Years there and sit there and you're watching TV and the burning building you know I was there so it's like we're\nWe're not on the outside looking in bad and the safety of like an FBI and you were in the burning building and one of the few people to get out which which covers that particular and if things ... ...\nIt's covered that particular and things we did it feel like on the inside because ... almost two months [noise]\n[noise] yeah you know yeah it was fifty one days almost like everyone was hungry in the shower that's for sure\nAnd of course there was a sleep deprivation or the all the ... the speaker systems playing music twenty four seven and\nI wasn't really music they play like sounds of rabbits being slaughtered all kinds of psychological they try to keep us on ads really I'm a I'm actually pretty surprised that no one shot speakers out during the ... the one day he sees the FBI is always talked about how\nThe FBI certain restrictions that not shooting at us which of course they did on the last day but uh yeah I think the people inside showed a lot of restraint not shooting the speakers though the course of you know however many days it was being bombarded with that kind of\nAnd noise um yeah I Know you you asked about the fire at the end there I was I came out of the side of the building where the cameras could spill yes I came out of the war the holes in tanks made a with three other people so for people survive that came out I'm of the area that I was in\nAnd I imagine you probably thought you were just going to be a moving target once you got out of the building\nI really did I mean I I went to the very last second literally the wall a that was next to be caught fire and I get my hair since you for it got out because I thought it was going to be shut I really didn't think I Would be here to tell the tale\nUm fortunately for me which I didn't of course realize at the time that I came out on the side of the building where the cameras even though they were two or three miles away can still see us\nUm we have the majority of the kids especially where the puck restructured the back of the women and you know one of the children some\nCore so a few of them have to [noise]\nUm at the back of the bill and no one survivor came out a lot of average just would say if that's where the kids were that that's where the majority of people were the people that come off the bat and I like to refer a lot to do a documentary called the rules of engagement that features an infrared video\nIf they had a plane that was flying above the ah the the the building that day two miles above the head and for a technology which\nShows light sources heat sources the lights and if it's cool that shows the dark\nSide to it it's like a black and white video on heat source yeah anyway we have a couple of different a flashback looks like\nThey could be part technique devices in areas where the fires beget\nBut we also have several shooters true right next to ... there's two tanks next to each ... fully automatic weapons fire being fired into the building [noise]\nI I bring this up because you know recently there was a documentary they documentary air it was very well balanced up until the end of the time they still claim that it was a mass suicide and the FBI of all the FBI guys on there saying help them I Won the white the children of Kearney built\nAnd you know the answer to the ad is it's hard to bring children out of a burning building if you're getting shot down when your ads thing to do but we also have several of the autopsy reports that have bullet almost to the center of the chest and the center of the ... that's not how you commit suicide [noise]\nI just bring us up here I Am sick and tired of of the media calling this a mass suicide if anything it was a mass homicide\nYou know and I apologize if you have any um the listeners that that don't want to hear what I have to say but everything I'm just saying as we can prove that there is evidence to it it's just the evidence that no one wants to talk about\nWhy was the big question for me just watching that unfold like so many years here we're negotiators dealer conversations for a month and I'm saying you need to come out and no one would ban done that\nYeah that's true I mean you know what another thing that happened is there was mistrust between David Lee FBI guy that you know didn't believe things they were saying and the people inside didn't leave anything the guy was saying a lot of that was because we didn't have a few\nOf the FBI goes cheaters that we were kind of working well west and the government would either put on a new\nPerson after we built to read poor and take the you know take one percent off\nOr they would they would just start lying about it for the press conferences and it would be like the negotiators will tell us one thing and the press conferences they would say another thing that of course that was because the negotiators have no control over what the ... commander southern dead and there were the ones that controlled the press [noise]\nSo you know the course of the fifty one days they really are we just did not believe what they had to see more and more and more and it really just kind of\nPut us made us stronger as a group and stronger are willing to not want to come out\nOf the deal will join just leaking survivors story out from him and being a legend into the branch to do the income on for\nA couple years leading up to that saying you know just saying that he was involved in in the midst of it certainly an understatement let's go back to your start with the ... and getting involved with the branch ...\nThat when ... serenity she was fourteen\nAnd that was you know I didn't meet a fourteen year old girl and I'm a church I guess she was Seventeen one time I met her but she just seemed a lot older than me so I you know it was it was odd coming to the realization and having to\nKind of ... did not justified but understand how young some of the girls like a show or when they had children with David you know about that was that was kind of heavy for me 'cause I I didn't really perceive it that way at the time that everything was that I was going through or\nAny of those women were his wives technically\nBut I'm not sure the exact number I'd say ten or so\nI I don't know the exact number I Know many of them didn't have children with them I mean to me it was like I I ... I thought it was when I was when I first got to figure out what's going on I thought it was kind of a miracle after\nWomen of the eighties and nineties being involved with just one person and how can they I guess I was a musician so I came in very nonjudgmental\nAnd and my my opinion of the whole thing was well hey if that makes them happy fine whatever I don't understand how they can do it I don't understand how they can do about killing each other but somehow they kept this place is\nKind of a miracle like that and I was a I don't know you know it's um I was cutting into a structure that already existed so who is I I I was there to throw in the scripture and that's kind of the way I looked at it\nBut you you come in as a twenty year old kid you've got some needs sexually among other things have your own show were you able to have any relationships with these women or did they all quote belong to David Koresh\n[noise] well I ... I didn't have any relationships with those women I mean it was pretty much you know I came in there kind of by the time I accepted that this is going to be the past I was going to choose\nUm ... it didn't bother I won't say it didn't bother me to be so that I bought it but it was like [noise] it was one less thing that's the thing about a good concentrate on spiritual thing so I I took it as a challenge that was you know I think\nGood for me ... years anyway\nWe've got to deal with all the males and lived there\n[noise] yeah pretty much you didn't have to say you could go and go do your thing if you want to put you on the stand the group that was the ... I was the deal\nSo all the women were were David and nobody else was\nAble to have relations with any of them\nWanted to stay in the group ... are you everyone had a choice to leave they want to know one was forced to be there and that you know that's interesting a lot of people want to call this like you know we're not allowed to date we controls everything if the if it was very fair with me on when I came in I spent about a month there that he said he\nHe sent me away for a couple of weeks the [noise] the I when I visited my family and may and I had the chance to get my head together and see if this was something I wanted to be a part of a cough I thought that was very fair you know and I started to do that with some other people as well so you want to choose to be there and you know I mean [noise]\nIf you made your choice it wasn't because you are comfortable that was because there was a deeper meaning a deeper message there that you want to the war\nAnd that's that's pretty much what it was for me I mean some of those studies were just phenomenal I learned so much about the scripture in life from from being there and watching David\nUh when he gave us the it was like he lifted it wasn't like he was just giving you a study and I remember when the very first day of the study you hit the scripture many you know without that he said this is two pieces of leather couch whether\nAnd with a bunch of pages in between knew some people try to figure out the whole was put up to us for it and he said I see that really panoramic Lee from genesis revelation as if it's happening right now and I thought that was any credit or credible statement to make I didn't believe it obviously over the course of the next two weeks he really try to prove that he didn't see the scripture that way\nHe recorded a lot of things along the way in those teams many of those tapes survived the siren nights on some of the the changed on television shows and very soon he talks about being\nA Muslim I'm Dead Sea with you\nWe actually talked about revealing a first steel he only got the first CEO completed and that was one of the things that that you know\nJournalistically tapered Arnold to of religious scholars that were on ATV a radio show that we were listening to [noise] um they even had the player the right to seven ... manuscript out yeah yeah of course that he was bluffing once that he finished this the first seal the day before the raid on each maple might teach [noise]\nShe's with the cable the CS gas so you have that came out from you know the person I was Ruth uh\nOr the ... rich fertile was typing it out [noise] and she came out of the of the root of the building with that first seal manuscript concrete it so you know the FBI so that was why but he actually just very seriously and he was working on writing an all out\nYou managed to get out of the building was on fire into real soon made a in a tank in a few people were able to make it out very few by the way a and a couple of them did went to jail so\nYou you avoid dead but you also avoid prosecution how did you manage that\n[noise] I honestly I just feel like I'm more of a lot of people that has ever lived I don't I don't know I Know that my mother was on the ground there and she was Bush short on every show that she could to kind of raise awareness of family voices and\nThat but that these people aren't\nYou know that they are part of their families are outside families and the patch you but the the parents of a chance to speak to the end of the beyond their loved ones but we're staying in my car multiplied [noise] that was that you are having an attorney\nThat I think it was really good and and I think needs something as the judge Walker Smith it just seemed like there was a bunch of favors ... even my factor\nOr something I had any control over I was thoroughly prepared to go to jail even though I didn't believe that I was guilty of anything um I just don't have the system works but I you know can I say I mean I just got very lucky and it's really no no nothing that I did that keep me out of jail just happened\nWhat do you do and now David\nWell I still play in a ban on the weekends even at my age and [noise]\nUm yeah I I I Am kind of an entrepreneur I sell stuff on line and that's that's that's it\nAnd the books certainly ... it is called wait till the
