they're extremely dry well it was a truly drought year all summer so we are limited crop and the car and drive down in the field and just about everybody my area's\nJust finished or there'll be finished by the end of the weeks and he'll even all across the board heard excellent emails all the way down to absolutely four year old so it's all across the board this summer the rain you got the green is basically\nThat really seems to be the story across the state in talking about your association involvement with being president this year any particular goals in mind for the organization for one\nOf our biggest thing is we'd like to get a farm bill signed this year it's already the deadline and uh\nWe've been working with our legislators tell them that we need a farm bill because there's a lot of programs without it or not funded like though the foreign market development and marketing this program or not funded without a farm bill so\nAll those programs these on September the thirtieth and they're very viable opening markets overseas basically what we need a farm bill before the risk management and all that so uh\nThat's one of the big thing for working for an open up trade avenues new markets and lengthening the ones we already here for delete any of our markets\nWill trade of course very important for Missouri corn farmers and opening new markets and protecting

rail take a lot of corn and DVDs and improve their air quality they're open up their market to a more ethanol\nAnd Canada is also a large importer of our corn so it's a very good thing that they're getting so\nMark as we wrap up anything else he liked to say the corn farmers out there today\nI like to be up there we always like let's say harvester than we're working on their behalf to help them be profitable and takes everybody we we need everybody could be on board to work together to make our industry stronger than it already is so there's always room to make our industry better\nPlug in
