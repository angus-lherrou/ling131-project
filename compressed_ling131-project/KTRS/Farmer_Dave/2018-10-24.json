China continues to make us think behind the scenes or\nA opportunities there and are they saying much of the time they kind of things get done out of the uh out of the public eye when these serious discussions go alone but I think\nHopefully we'll see something sued the good news about the discussions with the EU in Japan going forward I think John Will\n... will continue to see themselves more isolated than the world trade if we can make progress with you as well as a fan going forward\nAs we lost a few of our sales to China it appears that we've got some other countries may be stepping up and binds us product there again some efforts by a lot of people to get that done but definitely also some good news on that side\nBut it is that's one of the things I talked about are actually\nSay there is it you know are we if we allow China to become dependent on us or do we become dependent on China I think when we put so many of our production eggs and trade eggs in one basket we probably have become more defended that we need to be\nOn China and I think probably being able to find new markets is really helpful here as we learn how to trade with more people\nAnd Mr Secretary it sounds like an ... and it doesn't sound like a truly been confirmed exactly some rumors that maybe some us beans are kind of taken a southern route and taking a hard right may be ending up in China after all\nOil we think that's probably going on we can't verify that or don't try to validate that but we think probably a China is not going to stop eating just because of Troy disruption than we think

be after the election but I guess that we get these midterms out of the way so you know the the house and Senate have been continuing to a conference on it I think in progress\nThe house and Senate have been continue into a conflict zone in progress to ask but we'll get a farm bill everybody knows that ordered it is and they'll come together and get it done and we certainly hope it will be done by the end of the year so we don't have to go into an extension\n... is it the snap program what seems to be the glitch\nYeah it does seem to be the uh the the work requirements dealing with a ... step program and a house at work require much where\nPeople could not really ... through waivers indefinitely and the Senate didn't want to go along with that so that's one of the critical points there the president and I believe that the well America as generous as compassionate\nWe believe there should be an end to people who were able to work that provided they get training a we think these
