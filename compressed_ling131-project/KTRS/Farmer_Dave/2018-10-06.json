know to arrive and when I sat down and began to write the book in earnest\nWe'd always thought not only by me but by the publisher a W W Norton in company was going to be a book to appear you know to coincide with that we got a quarter of a century anniversary and so um\nYou know what I did I interviewed dozens of people I combed over to the archives I was out at the\nTime at the market Eric

and\nThat's another that's another way of putting it in [laughter] and I think a more powerful\nWay of putting it in fact I mean I think that a\nLot of these films were aimed at there is a kind of implicit subliminal die tactic message there yes that's that's what ... what how women are to comport themselves that's what they are to do\nLet's talk about one of the greatest elements of the

slippers [laughter]\nThey one of the most coveted items of of movie memorabilia as it turns out and I you know I I had thought up until very very recently to just like you said this is merely just one of the\n... the great and the ... as you put it as it turns out and this is I just did an event here in New York with Martin Meredith Hensley who published a book or a couple of months ago called destination Casablanca which public affairs [noise]\nUm [noise] that's the ... the publishers a publisher which compared\nWith what your book appeared and she uh in that book destination kind of a block which at one time history of the actual city it turns out that there was something I can to these letters and they ... they they basically what they were they were exit visas that were given a stamp and they were given a stamp\nFrom a a marshal they go\nFrom the V. she ... she authority right and in the film this is what's what's what's puzzling this puzzle puzzled the\nViewers for well Seventy five years is that in the interior lower eighties Viennese reels that inevitable accent is is what he says sounds as if he's saying that they're signed by general\nThey'd go Charles Shaw they go what you're saying though is is you know they'd gone so he's actually saying\nOh wow the one that was yes\nForever people have misunderstood his accent to be saying that the ... the leader of the free French but that time was exiled in in the u._k. act out in London um\nThey'd be signed by by by by a child to go where they can be signed by Charles de Gaulle they'd be absolutely worthless to me 'cause he was he was a persona non grata yet absolutely no authority under under the sheet gift like he had fled to lead the you know the the free French guide the feedback from afar\nUm and so that has puzzled viewers and that's been seen as as you cut it seemed to be going that direction yourself\nAs as one of those things that is completely out of sync with it with history you know that really requires the total to spend this money\nAnd it turns out there is actually a grain of truth there and I only discovered that when I interviewed narrative simply spoke for the New Republic a several months ago and and when reading\nIt I thought oh my God [laughter]\n'cause I like you I thought oh this is just something that you know what a great Hollywood can section that they are just with this up because this would be a great ... device\nOr Seventy five years to learn something new and do you have a year from Berman says she'll back in the life of its own there's something about it it seems to have children need a need that was there before the films need this film field what do you know what you need\nTo get to a great question that that's the that's the progress for the book um\nYou know I think I Would I Would I Would put a fine a point in debt can just say just say that it it's it's not just that needed it fills his his apartment to get its needs over time that they it's not a single need it's not it's not a sort of one size fits all need at the time I think that need was for especially with America's a\nLink to entry into the war so much a belated entry into the war\nUm is it up I'm Eric and needed to see something and you can follow the character arc of Rick Blaine\nThey needed to see these move from isolationism and there was such a such a strong current of isolationism up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor\nStrong current of isolation isn't it yeah that was really rampant in in America and and and it's very very vocal isolationist action and\nAnd it was really rapid in in America and and and it's very very vocal isolationist action in Congress [noise]\nUm but to see that move toward pulled engagement with the war effort and and and with the I like ... and I think that that was one of the early needs um and that need to in terms of the love story subordinate your own personal there's no interests\nFor the greater good of humanity um that's certainly one of of of of the need to I think that that that need or those needs has evolved over time um there's something almost kind of a\nI don't know poking about those needs I mean I think they they develop with each with each generation and the Nineteen sixties when people would flock to these repertory screening of the film whether it's at the battle theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts or your film society at Washington University in St Louis or it's half or University in Palo Alto California\nThen I think audiences and it's just you know these are people who are becoming involved the student movement of people at least becoming kind of a wiccan politically that he may have been somewhat different\nUm you know this is when the Vietnam War was raging and and and have a film that would have spoken to one's parents can only has a different maybe ... different residents there are a has a different register for for for audiences today I mean look I I think I I I one thing that I Need\nTo emphasize here especially the way in which the book has been received over the past uh twelve months or so I'm entered into the world and the Trump and and and and and at a moment when when refugee and minorities\nWere continually ...\nThey were being demonized for being\nA rhetorical you at least ... and ... and show that the movie resonate for audience is in and perhaps a different register now than it did then\nI'm even do event to people who are becoming increasingly aware of the refugee predicament in Europe and and those who were seeking to escape [noise]\nAh it's there and go to erupt Nazi and go to Europe and so maybe they need is is it can be spoken up and think of it but I I I think of it as being a series of different ... different times and then find much more kind of\nAn hour or whatever and knock you it's a a level I'm In the film I think fulfills a need\nFor moviegoers that need to to be completely meat or at least ... by the magic of this extraordinary story these\nAre excluded performances\nA terrific direction production values and so forth and I think that that kind of cuts to the heart of what America wacko were saying when he says you know at this point in time and it was like eighty when he wrote this in in ... Italy but that that that the cats are blocking that really merely one movie it it's the movies\nAnd that kind of place holder the cuts are black has become you know whether it's in my mid ... century women went into getting a plane or the mother figure in that voice over the very beginning when she gets to a movie says you know what I mean it does the second movie you see the poster of God to block\nThat movies in la la la land as well\nYou know ...
