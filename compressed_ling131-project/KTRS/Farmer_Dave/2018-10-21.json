I didn't do anything and you know nobody in my family but I Know you know my dad was in the army but I didn't serve\nTurner being the reference to the domestic violence Turner who beat up Tina Turner paint\nProbably the one person that one this week was Ike Turner 'cause he might not be the most high profile a domestic violence versus enough air Greitens might be what happens\nNow I'm Josh Hawley came out and said he should step down Peter King there came out and said he should resign needed some high profile Republicans as Kelly said but what's the next step now down there\n[noise] um well if you can imagine you're you sign up to serve the legislature here thinking I'm going to cut taxes are on I'm going to get a road paved in my district ... and now you're dealing with this and the governor won't leave and then the governor of tax the people so a hundred and fifty four to nothing is what they form this committee with\nHow you couldn't get a resolution saying water is wet to pass a hundred and fifty four to nothing adjusted in\nThese guys take their own time a lot of their time and look I'll just tell you a lot of folks in lesser don't make that much money\nAnd so you may live in like west plains or somewhere Springfield and you have to stay in extra day ah you miss your family they they they did the best they can do to put this report together in a time they had and the governor they they ask him to come they wrote him that everything they can do he wouldn't come\nAnd if you know the truth why can't you say the truth but it's I mean ... you have a lawyer that says don't don't say the truth or will decide what the truth is that child that ain't the truth\nAnd if a Governor Kaine level with his own constituents should he be the governor and I think they're gonna they they said they want to wait to move for impeachment after session\nI don't think that'll hold I think Republican women like Marcia ... and they're like Cathy Conway I think Diane Franklin is totally flipped our position and it's going to be for we're not going to vote on procedural motions with the Republicans until you make serious steps to get rid of this governor the Democratic leaders that it shouldn't be five weeks it should be five minutes from now\nI I don't understand how you could read that report\nAnd not have your mouth the gas and not say this person should I'm not saying he should go to jail I don't know that I'm saying that anybody would have a conscience as they should not be the governor of Missouri\nIt's interesting is uh John deal\nResigned after the text messages were a came to light of him sexting and take off being inappropriate comments a ... a step down a lot of people who have sort of been caught up in some of these two\nMen that had some care and concern for the state of Missouri a Mike here said it best the state of Missouri is bigger than one man it has been true from the start that no one in nothing is bigger than this man's ego\nI'm Scott with us from the Missouri times the um [laughter] it's we're hearing on the sex line last couple of weeks there are there are people out there\nWho still support him who say their members an apple two [laughter]\nThere is it's a conspiracy it's a witch hunt um it was consensual I was a private matter it happened before he was governor\n... how does that sound coming from drivers instead of\nI think maybe the ... there's probably\nSo they had a caucus yesterday before this came out and they present it to their members I Would say you had [noise] maybe it doesn't add up a hundred and Seventeen who said well you know\nThere's some technical issues we should wait and see there's a court case and then you had five or six there were like I don't care what he does on with their grind all the way into the basement\nUm the vast majority of the ... was not there they're not gonna they're not going to let them do that a Todd Richardson in all honesty might be the most honorable person to ever be the speaker of the house\nHe was very slow this is taking a long time where this this story broke the state of the state January night her sitting here in the middle April now he went very methodically discriminate to forty days frankly most of the report is what they took from her statement in the first week\nUh I think that there are some that will they'll find technical reasons again you've got people that are hunting for jobs you have people that are tight with different consultants it it it is scary to go against these people I can they they they hit back I can tell you firsthand right um but it's you go home how you go to church\nAnd looks hey look your daughter in the ... and explain to your wife while you support this being in the highest office in the state of Missouri if you can do that you got a bigger\nThis being in the highest office in the state of Missouri if you can do that you got a bigger than me and my garage you can see I got\nA pretty good size got a came down and politically oh God yes uh\nI I don't know\nThat he could get elected president lines club ... and you know here's the thing if he were to win this came out or even you know what when he when he actually got charge instead of saying oh this is Kim Gardner and scale a tour and cobra commander and was a Soros\nAll picking on poor little me feed it said you know what I Need to focus on my family and my trial I'm going to step aside or I'm going to go away my sense is that the problem with some of these things die down this reports never out and there's people that even like myself that were critics it will at least in the end\nHe cared something about the state he had something bigger than himself\nThe after he'd sit there and they won't you won't even call the speaker of the house back speakers been trying to call him to tell him to talk to her about this I don't know what that conversation was going to unfold but he's tried to ... going back\n... it's no now I mean after that after this if you can get elected then I'd be shocked of my stay still the governor and know what was in this report was given a look at least he did just that he loved it\nBut do you think oh no no matter what he had already ... before the rest of us are actually I don't think it well I don't think he did but I Know this will a break a little news right here on the air uh there was a deposition for the for the guy in question\nAnd at that deposition there was an unwritten jak the transcript of his of his testimony before the house committee now the house committee is telling me they didn't give it to him so one member of that committee had to give that under deck to copy out to the criminal the sex crimes attorneys over doubt Bennett\nAnd so he knew what was in what she said you have to think if they gave the guys the same whoever gave whatever member that committee gave him that gave them the woman's so they knew what was that there's another\n... years yeah it is that um the deposition for the husband\nYou're saying what's going on the ... yes yes and that doubt Bennett had a copy\nOf his report or his deposition from the committee and Jeffrey's incidents exactly what it was an omelet active so somebody\nFrom the committee had to give out ... that deposition\nBefore it was released the public exactly what I'm telling you so I Believe that if they gave him the guys I think logic says it gave him a woman's plus everybody ends up sitting was I I I was shocked the expectation you could've cut the tension in the ... in that place the last two days [noise]\nThe the the the expectations for this report were built so high I assume that would come under as ... I think the governor's PR people and the sex crimes lawyers over doubt Bennett we're we're raising expectations and actually they ... they heightened expectations were surpassed I mean there were Mal's dropped\nYeah what was what was confusing or what was what didn't match the hype was\nI was expecting a consensual report where to consensual people did some ... says that might be a little strange but if it's too can consenting adults so be it but what we got was a this was not a consensual relationship\nNot at all I mean it it you know this would make Harvey Weinstein blush I mean it was that disgusting uh and and you know here's the thing he was asked by a radio guy he was asked by a TV guy he was asked by David leaving some are bound to the a P they almost had him in the fetal position where they're interview there interview was very hard hitting that you take the picture he would never answer\nBut never answered that wasn't even under oath that was just weather weather reporters a quarter going um it boils down to this three things did he hit the woman you can believe everybody could waiver did he take the picture you can leave him or you can leave her and then he's still a fundraising list which I think is going to be the biggest thing I I Would say that that Josh Hawley what he said about this\nIf you clear McCaskill's ... Mohammed Ali Missouri politics if you like politics watching her operate she's opposed pro\nIf you wanted to Josh how they can stay in toe to toe with which I did which any reasonable person would she's the best watch how he's handled this that's the that's the kinda person regardless of party you want making decisions for the state in the U.S Senate I think he's going to charge him along with Kim Gardner and I think that there'll be no Republicans left that's not on the payroll\nAll right so um\nHow ... explain this to me they're going to they're going to wait for the Josh Hawley report on the email scandal or they're going to go with this report they're talking about a special session what ... ... if if they're talking to him and Peter and how I mean what can what's the next step here\nHere's here if you were Greitens [noise] he ... he did this real arrogant video last year when the legislature lead on calling the legislate I'm cancelling their vacations are going to get back to work right or if you needed on his Facebook page I saved a cop in case it ain't there today\nUh I I think that they they thought he could run out the clock and then I don't think there's going to be called the legislature bag or cancel their vacation I think he'd be helping them book a vacation\nA and I think the speaker wants to take off the table that you're not going to run the clock out we're going to deal with this\nHe wants to delay and confused and and and and you take the situation and make it as as murky as possible um I think that their initial plan was to try to finish their session and then deal with this I don't think there'll be able to do that I think that when the six million Missourians elected Josh all the top lawyer in the state\nHe said there is an impeachable offenses in here they should be impeached if he won't resigned\nSo was there an implicit assumption given that the whole world but Hillary Clinton was going to be elected president and the answer is sure that's possible maybe even likely\nBut it wouldn't change the decision I still had to crappy options to choose from\nBut one was much worse than the other no matter what the polls said I could speak about something or I could hide something from the American people will hiding something from the American people basically lying to them is never the right answer and so I'd have spoken no matter who was going to be the next president\nOr the emails on I'm Anthony wiener is a laptop why not investigate that first find out if those are different emails and then say something why say you're opening it up before you knew what was on the laptop\nYou that's a that's a really good question and a reasonable person might have decided to take the chance\nTo investigate a little and see what you have\nThe reason that didn't make sense to me is that first of all the the investigators were telling me this hundreds of thousands of emails on in the Clinton's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop including\nPossibly the missing emails from her first three months the secretary of state which run a different domain and we can't possibly review these before the election is just too many\nAnd so do you wait given that\nAnd then there's another consideration we'd had a problem with leaks\nWhat is it leaks out the friday before the election that you've been doing this secretly in some ways that's worse if worst can be imagined that's worse in some my judgment is that would not be a smart\nMove but I could also see people seem to\n\nThis is the best of motor on live in the morning here is ... on\nThe\nDirector of a study that came out called\nMissouri twenty thirty Ted welcome back big five fifty ...\nThis was developed by the Missouri department or the excuse me the Missouri chamber foundation and it said what was the goal of this study what did you what what what did you want to look at\nThis particular topic around the country now talking about a black workers search ever want to find a way to make it easier is already corners of labor or people are those are\nThe number one issue I here talking to businesses big and small tech companies regular companies restaurants you name it the number one issue businesses have today is that they can find qualified workers\nAgree with you we hear that all over the country are everywhere we study businesses are looking for people to have the right skills to be productive but also to help individuals find the job so I'm happy to be able to support their family\nIs it because the jobs aren't menial labor and Americans quote unquote don't like to do those jobs is it is it they're tech jobs that they don't have the skills for what's the what's the underlying problem\nThat I Wish there was one thing but it it's not just the most of the jobs that are in middle skills right now we're seeing a black truck drivers or lack the mechanics welders the and the operators\nThat while the jobs well we just have not figured out how to match people skills with the jobs that are available\nSo these are these are good paying jobs\nThat is correct but some of them by up to six figure jobs that many good jobs\nAnd you would think that the supply and demand right would sort of feel bad problem over a number of years\nYou want but if there's a lot of issues that come with this we have a lot of baby boomers affects the labor market so a lot of people with skills overtime or leaving young people are moving into the market change industries and jobs today make it harder for people that know what they should be\nStudying do what they should be prepared for out then you have jobs that are moving around the country around the state of Missouri [noise] so where did I find a job near me that I can learn the skills and find the job but I'm looking for and so what the\nStudy tries to identify a lot of the thirty one different acts of\nThe state of Missouri needs to take sector and the public sector better job of making that point\nPeople\nTend to how much of it is there just aren't the bodies were not a growing population\nIt's a big issue a three or four years ago everybody in America and everybody in Missouri was talk about the quality as to what the right skills\nBut at the job markets have high unemployment has arranged almost historical was all the country a lot of the people there were having fewer baby these days fewer people are coming into the marketplace of\nSupply and demand it's a real real testified that people can get Missouri specifically attracting and keeping people in the states that have good skill is a real issue the planet addresses that talk about trying to retain and attract power\nI Know there I can hear them screaming at the radio right now McGraw asked him
