Clinton you even see go people in the venue that night who are sending out a social media postings people in the area but what does that say Jim particular what what did you learn from looking at not studying\nOne of the really interesting things about the ... case study but we've seen similar patterns and others as well as you do have individuals in the same ... to their followers that they are in that and there's all sorts of things go well that's quite a\n[noise] hey from our content from New England Public radio NPR that last part time for music and great story on our Web site or wherever you [noise]\nIs is this a genuine message or is this someone one of the terrorists inside the venue who has to hold a ... someone's Twitter kept at is deliberately trying to do that for a confrontation so you kind of get these very\nVery dynamic situations that increase the pressure plates decision by the time to decide what are they going to do with all this information that is coming out in these kinds of seeds and the ... a case was a particular job with us\nAnd in other cases we see\nExamples of why people are really young for real time information if people buy it from the community and the emergency responders for instance the Boston Marathon in twenty saying that's an interesting case of a mess that we're being protected by the terrorists but also I caught up in the terrorist attack and so\nYou see is you see all these different ... kind of coming in to play now and there's a lot of public some political\nInterests of the current time around misinformation disinformation among other things we would try to do is try and say well actually in in the minutes of terror attack and in the house and sometimes that days\nIt's really hard to know precisely what is guy because yes you do have genuine contributes to social media who tried to promote public on the Senate will happen but you said the people who have tried to agitate the situation trying to mislead and deceitful\nSay what are you having fresh responded emergency services and indeed meter overnight sanctions\nWhile I think one of the things that strikes me about having looked across a large number of terror events is\nThere is enormous pressure these situations to get information out there to kind of be the person to break the story to kind of get that kind of skill\nBut actually it's similar when people get it wrong and this does happen quite regularly that people get it wrong that has quite the tub detrimental effects in terms of trusted institutions and trust in in democracy in those kinds of things and these things can be exploited\nSo what kind of say there are risks to go out to a lady and there are things that you can do to try and manage those risks so for example rather than just reacting to an event has a plot ... who are you guys talked to who's got this told things when can you say things\n... ... it's just trying to avoid the information vacuum that so often is just filled by load of ... and ... maybe some harmful militias messages as well designed to cause disruption\nThat ... I think what are the key findings rarely by by looking back over an extended period of time we're able to to track how place in governmental responses have changed at all to adapt to to to the new information of our but I Am one of the things that's quite clear is\nIf they say nothing if they do leave that vacuum that other people will come in and make mischief so it's really important\nFor all the place of the government and politicians to be able unclear to say in these kind of moments of emergency crisis what people are very unpredictable you know this is what we can tell you said that you do leave a cat so others can come into the field of misinformation disinformation\nPops mountain in ... and ... and you read that report what did you make of it I think it's really important what

that are responsible in some way for the information flow around these terrible events\nTo thing can advance about how they might respond to have a strategy in place which we can then follow that makes it much less likely that they will just do something to magically or make a mistake because you're far more likely to get it wrong if you go on your instincts at the time like this\nAnd I think it also has also advice for all of us we don't receive outside of journalists who are taking misinformation that coming out but also anyone has access to Facebook Twitter or any other social media which is think carefully about the messages that your amplifying as well you know they're just automatically\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate

think the number one question is that assumption of fraud until we can have an honest discussion about fraud without people screaming at you when you say the word fraud the American people will only view it in terms of inconvenience ... or suppressing voters\nSo we need to get to the truth first and find out just how big a deal is this frog what on persuaded one hundred percent as that is so high it shocks the census\nSomeone else who seems dissuaded ... is President Trump he's routinely claim that millions of people voted in legally when he was elected two years ago\nHe's never offered any evidence for that claim but often the election he did set up a commission to investigate election integrity from votes costs to folks have registration forms\nThere's no actual or real verification done by election officials once they get that for to make sure that for example it's a real person\n... is a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation a think tank in Washington DC and he was a member of the president's commission\nAnother example of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that non citizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not check\nThat's a problem and is the problem that in many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place\nAnd give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are tearing up a specter for problem where there wasn't really a problem how do you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of the law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election\nI don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes it would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we

history of folk to depression and what your political opponents say is that the signs of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate packing the focus oppression\nNo doubt that they're convenient are scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes in fact it's a bit patronizing I think frankly borders on racist\nTo believe that for example African Americans\nDon't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with old most surgical precision I offer tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who are suing said was this is going to depress turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record\nIn the state already boom and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the pilot the mold and fight for voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's a very small\nProblem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county ... county there\nWhere it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and has made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out surely you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting than fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the balls than voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or be swayed from participating because of barriers that have been erected ... to the ballot box\nOf what evidence do you have that they actually do\nI think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and at a reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally\nBy government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the end ten or Republicans have claimed on many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have helped them carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also it just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the

on and get your ticket today at NPR does\nUh such an outcome so uh I don't really see myself on the side of shutting down the border nor do I see myself on the side of having an utterly permissive and open policies\nBut it is a very polarized debate that is the way it's being framed at the moment either you're on one side of the other\nIdiots polarized and its polarized for a variety of different reasons one of which is that people tend to approach the issue very sentimental a they tend to use language that is very romantic inexpensive but that doesn't really take into account the fact that around the world there are literally billions of people who are seeking opportunity for a better life\nSo when you use very expansive language about how we ought to welcome all people who are basically law abiding peaceful well meaning people\nPeople tend to neglect that this would really entail a radical change in the nature of our society is the nature of our welfare states and much else and also on the other side you have people who often times are very concerned about the changing character of their societies\nBut you know they don't appreciate that to some degree the character of these societies are already changing regardless of what happens these have you migration so I think that there's a lot of confusion in the debate because of that\nWon't you'll sit says fill than\nMy answer is pretty straightforward my answer is that if you're thinking about the coming decades we're going to face major challenges of off shoring automation and much else\nWe do need to have somewhat more integration somewhat more cohesion in our market democracies which otherwise risk coming apart at the themes in class terms and many other terms besides and because of that with that in mind we ought to adopt a more integration friendly\nMigration policy one thought is that you're not necessarily going to radically increase\nThe number of a new migrants what you will do is perhaps move towards selecting them on the basis\nOf skills selecting them on the basis of a who will be in a position to help finance\nThe safety net for the various migrants we've absorbed over the last thirty or forty years because that to my mind is the really big challenge it's the second generation challenge how do we ensure that the second generation the children of working class immigrants are properly integrated into our society and are allowed to flourish\nIt kind of changes the whole nature of what America is about though is well doesn't it I mean America is always being about people coming to the American dream is being always being the country what people just go to realize what they call it ...\nWell ... I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses on firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSeven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was a hugely important part of population change in the states in that era if you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skill workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates a new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures on challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe signed on editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is the panelists immigrant who arrived to seek a new life and through hard work determination goes on to prosper and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described\nAs homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to the Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration and how immigrants have been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd in the grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did that manual labor the agricultural labor\nBut they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely British allies the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is miss\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have\nAlways been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what's happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the myth of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth and twenty a centuries\nHas applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen in the early twentieth century large European integration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outset operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh

today\nIt's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor\nLow educational levels and they are stealing a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them\nBut there is not upward mobility shutdown\nAberdeen period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrants with the same as as for European no there have even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been an Asian or Latin American\nAfrican immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those calculations have been permanently marginal and\nPlayed at your own a different and the political spectrum too around Salem the editor of the national review who hit from the other what do you make of his document\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America in a moment to allow the current population to adapt to change it calling me will needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is\nChanging it to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people of color who
