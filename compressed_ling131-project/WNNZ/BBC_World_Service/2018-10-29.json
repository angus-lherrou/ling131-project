minister will deliver his budget it comes after the British prime minister Theresa May promise to an end to austerity after eight years of Eunice is here from our business asking are we expecting a big spending budget for Britain them\nWell as you say shine that Theresa May the conservative party conference last month declared to much fanfare that austerity is that after eight years of cuts in public spending freezes in public sector wages and sweeping cuts to some seven ... seven says particularly at a local government level\nBut the prime minister said that thanks to all that belt tightening that will be better days ahead this afternoon in parliament allies will be on finance minister Philip Hammond he's known as the chancellor to see if he can deliver on that problem is kind of MSN from the Institute to fiscal studies here in London said it would be easy\nThe chancellor lights is coming very difficult task at hand Theresa May want him to paint austerity um but he also has a commitment to trying to eliminate the budget deficit I'm so used to have nine will come and boring from about the mid twenties ...\nAnd the situation is in is in the last financial ... boring was around forty billion pounds\nAnd so it was full cost to come down over the next few years but because of cost spending so on the one hand he want to not be cutting spending because we want to endorse territory but on the other hand he needs the deficit to come down until then she be eliminated to me seems to have a commitment to get it fully going\n... juggling act to finance minister Philip Hammond among the spending announcements we are expecting him more money the public services particularly mental health services as well as some money for infrastructure spending and that's in an attempt to base to Britain's productivity\nI mean it's an optimistic headline but aren't Britain's finance is really dependent on Brexit and the deal it gets when it needs to you\nMr Hammond is expected to tell and pays today that the really big decisions on public spending can only be made one suspects that deal has been done in Britain's feature trade arrangement with the European Union has become clear as kind of innocence that we really don't know what that will look like just yet\nThe government's focus so far been predicated on a kind of orderly smooths breaks it it's certainly the case if we have a very disruptive breaks it so for example there's no deal made with the European Union and we just ... to trade on WTO terms that would be hugely damaging in the short run\nAnd
