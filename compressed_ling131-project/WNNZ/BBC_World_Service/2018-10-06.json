is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big\nAnd the ... now from fossil fuels than being depended on the ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy and seeing a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the Norwegian government be granting new exploration licenses for oil and places like the ... seats in the ...\nTo ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gas mission can Goodman says well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on cold in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah but my point\nIs that if you have very pleased coal plants for example of gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nI have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do both\nChristopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration if in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and ah\nIf I can draw an acceptable and find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about with climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNow China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and I feel if I was an Oxford last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt will thing that Norway it's the bad guy and to put it into words for the students and when I talk to them today and pull them out what's going on with us\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nGet our fault that field ... ... I Would look at the time frame\nBecause clearly but says well it could be draining until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty one third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is\nBased if we go to do a big big job to do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that they need to know it's and and we've been debating and those are\nThe numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built how fast new investments are being made into when you pull energy and it's so many different types that renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the whole as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas how into his anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmentalists just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and it's become the act but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long\nAnd it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify yourself and you know I mean a lot of people\nHave been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down the protection that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince is kind of\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example we are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable but where do you get to ... do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic

if you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and\nWho are going to develop that well it's the engineers that now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that a ... that's called at three new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green if it a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more\nGreen gay or at the same time we have to address CCS seem to you because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it is both a central

and he's here has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think you also need to challenge the politicians have with a greater pen because I don't think when you were saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know\nWhat the harm is doing the climate changes if you're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with

and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in there and see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for

see the current president being originally suits to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe gas will exclude cold wave to cover lay on what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out renewables\nFail and would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid he'll be able to carve uprising no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seen through new energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are\nActually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to to guess and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more

Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAbout all the infiltration into their systems but\nOf course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of flack raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think even though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame the nation\nThat is that does cause adaptation of damage and that does ... said the way for a more economic sanctions which would be that greedy a challenge for the Russian economy now\nLet me bring my guest into my thoughts were pushing and what's on your mind [noise]\nWell I was struck I mean I'm kind of drawn the car and and and I don't know much about sort of the modern the modern equivalent of ... I was struck by the stereotypes of released by the I think the Netherlands I'm\nSort of at least about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to go ... full of equipment or a jacket covering and ... and ...\nAnd and they were sort of they came on the on diplomatic passport but presumably would would trace from from that from the beginning so it seems strange to me that we're talking about cyberattacks but then it had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how most of them are done or is is is data just bundling by by that these people\nI Believe like you know these sorts of attacks that combined both uh I was reading so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combine it with online activity or what happened yesterday with it of relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for Russians and that it just because they are have been very keen and the recent years to show supremacy and ... and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know with all these things and with a few car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless are going on from the Russian policy but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and then you know a sooner or later you would leave some ah ah you know in the ... I Would call them digital Brett comes over some physical evidence that would then ah basically lead to what happened yesterday\nAnd I have to say like you know like the uh these uh spies was caught in April and the only had about a a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of\nAh coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm\nJust on a purely practical level um it seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism on what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives in the sense that we don't know if I'll say spoken or written been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like Columbia temps that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what I'm certainly is a story that it's interesting to me that the the narrative reverse it seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean is there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds you think well\nI think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and the and the way and a good place like you know that managed to get back to gather all these governments and to have all these like press conferences ago across the globe I guess obviously like that does for them and a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are\nOr you know I call it to you know I\nHope Savage times uh then it's kind of a you know like with what we saw yesterday was like you know how clumsy they way I kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know they've been trying so eager to lead to prove that they're so great at these kind of like starts in people's minds actually you're not that great ...\nI mean you you use the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the Kremlin when you look at president ... for example you just look very embarrassed\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether I Would draw the lines\nOf seems there may be people looking at a red faced\nSure they didn't receive than use our happy face it I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you're trying to show off your at your skin and then you get called in the end of summer day at a at them that's not really a great day for you [noise]\nAh but that's also like you know over the like the the Russian uh\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day payoff university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writer and rolling no for August twenty seventh applications at bay past dot edu\nOr they look at the uh the investigations they always say there's no proof over you see although we did see you know the force by the pictures and all of these things so that's that's not really surprising thing\nFor them not just as soon as I said I Do find that I'm finished that it it it is creeping into our everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives and a lot of pushback against this than\nI think that's a very good question and I think you know one of the things that we could do as citizens and our day the knife it's back to something called digital hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know\nA change and get past with the old fashioned backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for of how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave you a door open and I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back to these minimums things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um adage that hygiene limits up to eighty percent of the ... crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir like this sophisticated enough investigation\nDonut geopolitical level do you see any sign of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level\nSo late to this this month Russia or expanding on submitting to draft a constitution\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for how state should behave with a to get a you know each other and decided to space but also one or two I said just staying in you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been a um implemented by the concept of Europe\nSo obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday and I think um so the Russian activity and like you know they wanted to separate Missy but also\nThey want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that the upper paying something and the information every now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals so you've got that on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against this ad is just so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you know that are no you know Russia or China or like with the west the states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided the kind of like you

there are a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China and wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers at subways and bus station\nBut before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThat Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities um\nAnd brought the five women kid aging where they put them in detention in that same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually ... dead and enormous global outcry I'm at at which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... said the government made the unprecedented

almost randomly selected\nBy the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism um but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women and China have have been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally to bring my guess would do as well I'm Emma may be a question too\nClose Hi is it and I wanted to use it as green today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect to me to kind of on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally made two went viral globally I thought that that they can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there is very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedom so unlike in the U.S square\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is um news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China\nHave virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles and and today you still see young women emerging up all across China\nUm across sectors even across class coming out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being censored come on [noise] well\nThey a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the made to hash tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when I made to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activists came up with the idea of using him oh jeez I'm for that character as it sounds like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie image eat me\nToo [laughter] I should get around and and and it worked for a while but then the then it'll get right Patricia\nI'm just wondering whether this movement to give them some ended by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese from this chain too much with the sort of one child policy on that because there were probably a few a woman but more than ... than the than they might have been a generation of but whether this played into its at all\n[noise] well I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investment and so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently so troubled by this I mean when you look at ... ideology that doesn't necessarily say do you that you should be what region of the women complaining for equality or do we\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provoked such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written in kids\nStreaming of New England public radio
