by issues like immigration and the Democratic electorate which is focusing on much more traditional bread and butter issues like\nIn particular this year health care\nThat means that it's an election

campaign\nThat can move some of the voters who are on the fence we saw that in the presidential campaign after the combing letter and other things are going on in the last week\nWhere people moved into Donald Trump's direction I think right now this is a kind of issues that ... to talk about the importance in terms is you know unfortunate but\nYou know there is a midterm election and if anything this is not the kind of discussion President Trump would want going into the final week of a mid term campaign people are very concerned about what's going on and this affects people's outlook towards the state of the country\nAnd he has the Republican Party come to terms with a Trump presidency I mean across the Republican policy\nWell I think it's interesting 'cause there's there there was a note Trump burst for quite a while they have pretty much vanished I think it's fair to say that this is Donald Trump's party when you look at the votes for key legislation you look at what Republicans are saying at worst they say well you know he's got some odd characters\nThings that I Wish she didn't talk about so much or tweet about so much but the agenda I'm really solidly behind there's very few Republicans who are distancing themselves\nWho are facing election right now or reelection from Donald Trump I mean they they are really you know stepping in line to his administration and his presidency\nI was gonna say if I may it there is relatively little difference and polling data\nBetween people who identify as Republicans and people who tell us that they voted for Donald Trump it's not as if from one group is any different from the other on in terms of their political views what we find is that Republicans in particular are taking their cues\nFrom President Trump and while they may not have\nAn opinion that matches his when an issue first emerges\nAfter a week or two they do in fact echo the Trump position so we've got Donald Trump effect is leading\nThe party and reading those people who who voted for him two years ago on if I can add something about\n... we've had shootings in the United states we found a lot of mass shootings over the years it does relatively little in the long run in terms of changing opinion about gun control about what to do about gun violence\nOn there's usually a short term effect but it it dissipates in in a surprisingly short amount of time a week or two so this coming ten days before the election it's sort of hard to see whether or not it's going to have any meaning to voters when they go to the polls on next Tuesday\nUncovering what about Republican women because there are lots of things about what this president is alleged to have done to women and the things he says about women which might outrage women even if they are loyal to the Republican Party\nI've spent a lot of time over the last few weeks looking at the relationship between gender and partisanship and how that affects Kenya and\nAnd what seems to be the case is that Republican women and Republican men don't differ very much when it comes to opinion about Donald Trump they did not differ when it came to opinion about\nSupreme Court justice now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh where we see gender differences emerged can be very distinctive is among those people who identify which neither party on independent women are very different from independent meant\nYeah and I I Would add to that uh is clearly more about party than it is about gender with the exception of back critical group voters and the basis of both parties are pretty much lock stock and barrel behind their party's candidates\nThat leaves these independent voters and especially independent women and\nWe're so much fun last year with doing it again New

there is a swing group that's probably the group of voters that just zero in on\nWell then let's finish by talking about the Democrats we report quite a lot about changes in the Democratic party a much more progressive voices the kind of establishment Clinton I really losing the influence how do you see that Lee\nI you know [laughter]\nI think there were a couple of primaries that sort of got some headlines I'm not sure that we have\nAnything that's clear looking ahead to let's say twenty twenty at this point other than there's a lot of globalization among the Democratic party I don't think Democrats at this early picks side as to which part of them\nIs going to dominate the process I think they're unified in their opposition to President Trump to this point\n... if the Democrats take control of the house of representatives um it's very likely that Nancy Pelosi will continue to be\nThe leader of the party in the house and she is certainly identified as one of the old guard on the other hand she's also a woman which is a distinction that may prove valuable in terms of her contest for house speaker for Democrats taken Trump\nJust a short answer from each of you or how likely is it that the Democrats will take the house or even the Senate ...\nWell I think you know the ... and I suspect cats will agree with the conventional wisdom maybe right this time I can agree on how it's like the Democratic and and the send is like the state Republican\nIs very likely that the national house vote is going to be clearly in favor of a Democrat but the way districts are drawn that may or may not result\nIn a Democratic majority in the house of representatives the Democrats have a terrible time trying to reach a majority in the Senate just because there are too many vulnerable red state Democrats who are on the ballot this year\nAnd and very few Republicans who I see that the that Hillary Clinton carried so the reverse doesn't hold it was just like all these Democrats are
