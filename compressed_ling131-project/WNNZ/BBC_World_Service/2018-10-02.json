I think for my last eleven years since I went back home my view it's completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality that you know time is it time and this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came to being the a leading in flood level was very extremely they know in the condition and somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact three died of blood and and draw divide Soviet truck goes after you know six seven hours looking at ... and ... and she's good to go on a number of ... you cannot have children you have to do you have

second husband if I don't give him a child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just to save our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader start listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being a physician who or training to what that transformed my clinical skill and Web approach\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you face take all the first one to ask you point out about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for a long because most treatments were designed for men and women might inside well\nScience has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere is a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women so much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women in late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of\nThe science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\n[laughter] can you give us an example of the disease that affects the two sexes different she\nLet me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries in the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference so if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the\nStreaming of New England public radio

beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow ... you're working in somebody at a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority what was the greatest Barry is to say just treatment for the women in you'll catch\nEverything you can imagine that there because when you're done ... where you\nDon't have laws to follow you know the\nBrutality

sitting along with us along with volunteers so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking the business of\nCourse here nine points to go ahead what we find is\nPublicly politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people in all kinds of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair up and get to assess tend to be told to calm the retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take care of some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those discussions\nAbout I think one of the things that should change in the future to get repair back in to our daily lives is that the professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repair professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that\nA professional repair to become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd\nOf course there will be different on labor costs in different parts of the welfare so\nYou're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening to have\nOne thing I wanted to talk about and I

that people want it high intensity lasers but if you want that in the high intensity actually destroys\nThe laser itself and so this idea was to work around that and you get high intensity just having a lot of energy in short health\nSo tripped false amplification is about taking a shortfall and making it very long so the power goes down you can amplify it up then and the intensity still not very high and then after you've amplified at team energy you go back and be compressed supposed to make it short\nAnd you have all of the energy in a very short pulse ready for your experiment for
