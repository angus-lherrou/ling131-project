easy for me to just know to the un rather just\nJust won't do that you have to think about Barry Coleman into mention getting emotional\nThing to do and when you do and to not check 'em your psychologically changing something in your house to the nation and doing it\nThanks to Sophie page ... thanks to my easily inclined to produce ... for that mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't truth still have an impact on the way we behave and to Jane rise and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or a tribute to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are\nHere for a reason so for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being causes related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on that was a bit of amusing about food do and um but producing those very cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything happening to them\nYou're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the mood to believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nHow a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the tuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nWant you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three chosen okay good now you can keep your ...\nOr you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what\nDo you go full you should go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a okay this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them around like forty percent of them will stick with one ...\nWhile that could really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and I'm sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first intrusion system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition I said this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid does not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition

citizenship\nYes of course that is a part of the current tradition a of of of of western liberalism\nThat's not really the issue that we're facing now however it's a matter of whether the values that we profess actually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that was so disturbing\nAbout the cabin I hearing is just watching um the institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with\nPot politics with um impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge\nSo those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society are really the strike at this point over the direction that the country is going and\nIn which patriarchy has significantly lost some of its constraint but that's not the world we live in that Christine Blasey Ford knew that many of the women who have experienced sexual abuse and know that as well as many men no that so this is not a matter\nUm individual versus group as a matter\nOf how our society shapes how different groups of people are\nAre interpreted ... who's seen as having the ability to get angry and still be taken seriously and who's not given that a\nA same luxury that that's the politics of patriarchy playing out where I can society today\nAnd I get the same so but you know just from this conversation from your writings too there you are angry angry about the way America works and and your view of of water use a patriarchal society that oppressors groups including women and minorities is something that makes you angry but to change it\nYou have to you have to reach out beyond your own groups whether it be women or whether it be African American you know to build a winning coalition\nYou've got to go national and you've got to obviously you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities so how do you go about building those coalition that cooperation\nWell so I I guess I have to roll back for a moment\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay pest dot edu\nThing in my writing the whole point of intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of color coalitions\nThat are necessary in order to realize our\nStated values and objective um there are many applications an intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms of discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago I was going to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas ah over in\nAs against the claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminism sound and the fact that the very term sexual harassment the very knowledge admit that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely stepped forward by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist shoulder\nIs but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights companies\nHave to the history of looked as you say the failure of the times of of ... feminist to make common cause with the black ... I'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says\nI find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to hold back into survival mode\n... dumpster fire on live by a\nBlack feminist agenda and\nI mean the Libyan people who actually\nSay the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group lists\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike I'm so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack\nShip of a white women it's not surprising I'm often frustrated\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent\nActually believe Dr lazy Ford there's I'm far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean the gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time I know this guy is a problem\nIf I get I get the industry now the argument that you could bring different groups of press people together to make common cause with them I can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to motives are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we called groups well\nOf us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest that that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield in Joburg falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nThe last week opens up even more possibilities are\nEvery thing that we've been seeing suggests that many women are particularly those that fifty three percent that in that in fact voted for Trump\nMay be rethinking that but let let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about Iraq Obama because he's with the midterms coming up his Reagan's of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this ...\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll GB the Americans that is all known since I said I go vote\nFrom every demographic do you see Obama some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach Joe do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually walking rather cool enough he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWell I think it's tough for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have mine disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that\nI'm sort of difference um within a broader reality\nA country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania I'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible\nTo win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections in what we're in an election season with the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition it is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nUh the ... democratic voters he said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culturally liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white with the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino\nSupporters that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics is he's a very complex a complex set of relationships in attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I'll I'll make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that game the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first Democrat to the elected I'm from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wells on the bus but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas that\nActually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition\nStreaming

as influential\nAs Tim burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important to scale that's a

looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted\nBy sixty percent box but

thoughts or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's

block chain to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity um with the reliability\nPretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the black change is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decent life at the time it's not just from an\nIffy centralized but it's also you can delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least
