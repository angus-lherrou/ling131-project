still finding fates and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent should put some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still like ... so they look kind of lacy under a

she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south\nTo professor Harry said you've got the wrong south these young sales go through it again and that and she did and she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she was about to me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to\nTo basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it failed at that it's probably ...\nHow many broke city search uh probably about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of looked at some actually maybe you're on to somebody had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated old thousand ten minutes young

about democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise to democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but we've got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom\nBut also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be

century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting

ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they've philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove convert them so why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and
