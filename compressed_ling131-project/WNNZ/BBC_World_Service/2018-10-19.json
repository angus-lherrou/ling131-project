people in the early ... an Indian everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not the wise approach in Wilson a rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe are people who are involved each we have people embedded in relationships institutions are not since feelings do methane his age or longing to place to people to communities and countries messes me kind of feeling out of politics and they've got to\nThe obvious question that followed from that has been loaning ... onto wet and ease parts of the reasons for identity politics that actually it is people expressing offensive on the longing that she ... the identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement ... on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far end of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or you're Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinction it's a tribal one in fact\nThat's a boring observation and northern Irish politics but that's that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tribe then they want representatives who are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say ... voice is a very clear that on Nick durable\nIn some ways it was six if you'll never end or a movie in India and you are preaching to the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India a Hindu view of India it\nWins bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClump sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural\nTendency of people to especially when the larger amount gum is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but\nIt but it's all politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay I mean I'm\nVery bad at all I don't take it out\nI think the question is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off as a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious or ethnic group and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nBut one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan when I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and it on the things that's\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nAn incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response is to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast of nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make an inclusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it does have level of the kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all the different groups under the common identity\nAnd how do you make that journey from being a cause in public and a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots\nPatriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country wherever they from you can also respect patriots who love that country it's a question of mutual respect\nTo the other hand over all the things that he's saying that you love found that it isn't that are going to talk what's wrong and loving your country and its people at the end zone accuse people of identity politics but I'm saying you're not just\nBecause you never you opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you do your um your your national thing making my country but the majority\nOf the majority of them so I look at nationalism and\nThat's something that the head of the stuff that's in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous obese\nWhat is the right to response will be ... into it but it is the or the national Congress party but said but we're all Indians are respective\nNow that he's not he's not ... it's not as though the older a form of nationalism and the Congress talk he didn't have ... elements to it the one\nHand you know days of areas of angry as well as looked at what age and if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between\nFigure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good thing\nWell 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching that can build a bridge you know we can be workers we can be people of of a place like a village or the city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the cross 'cause it's found bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further the kind of cosmopolitan is my guest spoke about that can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here and beyond says that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride at the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiple and of course on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself\nThe ones that have foisted upon they do and\nThe people like ... like a mountain dew for king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way but I
