aggressive what should be raised in rhetoric can deteriorate into the quest for the perfect put down\nTo create a narrative that people are drawn into that requires a lot of language that requires time it requires patients\nKendall Phillips is a professor of rhetorical studies at Syracuse University in upstate New York\nIt's also hard to analyze the argument or reasoning of a tweet\nTo two hundred eighty characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major premise a minor permission to conclusion it's much easier to just use a two word phrase or hash tag that usually ends up adding to that kind of political division between my side and their side\nTo more and more we have to learn to be critical consumers are the messages around us and we need to understand what it is that makes it persuasive and then ultimately make a decision for ourselves what are we willing to be persuaded by\nProfessors Phillips is also a past president of the rhetorical society of America\nOne of the things we see particularly in politics around the world these days are\nWhat would be considered fallacious arguments one that we hear a lot especially in democracies is what the Romans called at population which is an appeal to the people and this is when you sort of say well everybody agrees everybody knows everybody's saying all of us agree to this\nWhen you talk to every single expert and you just talk to ordinary people and you talk to businesses everybody understands that the problem is not getting better just getting worse\nWhen maybe we actually don't all agree to this but you're just creating the illusion that there's some public opinion where there's actually not any opinion that's been articulated by the public\nThe other that we hear a lot in contemporary politics is the ad hominem which is an attack on the person and so especially I guess in our country it seems as last few years that politicians have been much more likely to go negative attacking aspects of the character of another candidate and not actually dealing with the issues\nThat St Lawrence and I'll tell you ... you probably are worse the gym but I Will say anything nasty guy now I Know why you just have one endorsement on his own\nThing covered over through a popular him or it goes negative as an ad hominem we may find ourselves persuaded but we still don't really know the basis of the stance of the candidates were now support it\nLet's say you're reading an article on line about whatever's going on in the world and the rhetoric and there is swinging one way or the other the more you know about rhetoric them more you can see when you are maybe being persuaded in a way that you don't want to be persuaded\nCare meisters one of Kendall Philip students for her there are clear reason to concentrate has studied on rhetoric and its influence on her generation she's twenty two but that doesn't make it easier to describe the cost to friend\nA lot of times they don't even know what rhetoric as they were like so what are rhetorical studies in to this day I still struggle with explaining it but I think it's frustrating when people are reading things that kind of your swayed but you know really read between the line see what they are saying and I think when you don't really understand the true meaning of rhetoric you don't realize how you're being persuaded\nIf we can be so easily influenced by the words around us it is yet another arena when machines may have something to teach us\nI think that one of the claims made by ms ... was that people

in that book that is related to cool\nIt she says that I rebel therefore we exist and what he meant by that is if you're a rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model for fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a ... said\nAmerican sort of

cement the idea of the rebel as cool idea this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen listen to it I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who quite different from the Nineteen forties from law here is of Humphrey Bogart and robot Mitch\nYes in movies Marlon Brando James Dean and also Montgomery cleft made rebellion attractive their style is disaffected a sensitive vulnerable and even plagued with self styled\nJames Dean was easy for why teenagers to identify with he became a superstar a legendary I kind of cool when he died in a car crash at age twenty four after having made just three films only one of which had been released east of eating\nThe other two are rebel without a cause and giant were released after his death\nHis disaffected attitude struck a chord with young people worldwide\nWho saw on him their own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded adults\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous as soon as the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings in the Senate people were persecuted I'm for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any were at extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified

was a time of white flight from the city's after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do there so you had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time\nHaving the luxury of a rebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nAnd countless style that these films to fashion came to be seen as cool too

of the other major shake his from his parents we must have to get to him about it that the rebels spirit was a singer Elvis Presley\n[noise]\n[noise] Joe\nSo why did Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool\nWell Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away\nAnd when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot he shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also hits on\nThe black charts on the rhythm and blues ... he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or not but a lot of his African American beers at the time also enjoyed his\nSinging and his take on NASCAR contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any you once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do with the next time\nSo we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impact people like James Dean into Elvis Presley on popular culture house of course being huge and it's transmitted to such an idea of crude across the globe but I Wonder what you will think how we really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great

there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America could you what's your view\nWholly American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant

said and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US

... the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... different players involved as you said it's how does shelf co fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this whole whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way\nAnd he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in the stomach itself so that means\nWorking with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress

I don't\nThink that because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the ... more authority\nAbsolutely and particularly you once you get to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public say so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so\nThat as a mass scale and kind of ... ... it's going out and owning a living and so and so when science professionalized it's which is actually a very light developments and we were talking\nLate Nineteen centuries before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a a Korean policy can fall I say a a kind of a joke that you could name for whether it's training whether all existing sought to society's channels you can publish in\nAnd reached by what she can expect to live and so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite tone\nAnd by that point ... women are very much being excluded from those of cheating any historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places that that happens so they're all its average and granted she's one of those places where you might end up living by doing scientific walk\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding mind exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you know finding people doing scientific research within you invest states for example so yeah it's really only make sure on that you get the kinds of scientific Korea that we would understand that if someone's that she paid to do ... to solve a particular problem\nIt's just pretty much across the will of the case or or you took him specifically about Europe ...

World Service we live in ... and I'm James ... says well up they now there's no shortage of celebrities and politicians ready to lend support to campaigns protecting threatened to walk like such as elephants and tigers and plenty of public support and that for money too\nBut what about lays on the front line of carrying out that was the wildlife range is charged with protecting the animals from purchase\nA new report by the environmental group WWF suggest conditions for those ranges oh bad they suffer high rates of illness in my training and even basic equipment\nAnd we'd be in the studio a WWF or hissing who's being the leading this research welcome to the program tell us a bit more about those conditions I mean they're pretty boy for we're talking sometimes range is not even having ... boots\nRight imagine if you are living in a very remote location away from your family you don't have access to clean drinking water you don't have access to clean toilets which are the basic needs of any human being what is happening the rangers have\nDoes not have access to all these things at the same time the walking under extremely dangerous conditions because people just aren't just stealing these animals from the forest and also they are going to the\nMental stress ranges have to stay away from their families and we have done a study on their mental stress and it it's it's very shocking said what what what's the situation that ranges are walking on that extremely difficult dangerous conditions Wade noted combination\nIsn't it the case that you know by not having the equipment they need and as you say suffering high rates of illness because of wherever working I mean that's the bus but it's going to make anybody not want to go the extra Marlin doing their job particularly if a job as a dangerous one\nAccurately and but it was quite surprising like we did the subway so suddenly the largest ever study done on ranges and we looked like surprised when the rain just said they really want they they're really proud of their walk they love what they'd be but at the same time we have to make sure\nThat if you really want them to continue doing this for than we have to support them be have to give them equipment for example basic boots\nHalf of them don't even have boots and they end up spending their own money for buying mood send uniform when every during your salary is nine dollars a day which is more or less than actually uh somebody makes in in a McDonald's\nSo how do we how do we change the situation I mean clearly it's up to the governments of the country is concerned but I mentioned you know we have big wildlife appeals people give lots of money can can confirm about not be diverted to the ranges I hate is being knocks it is but where's it going I think that\n... so we have to look at three\nThree levels of solution number one is the rangers or the government employees so uh do you mainly we need to look into the policies that\nAre beside the recruitment of ranges training of ranges their insurance ballot benefits they're family very sad\nAnd those are the phones needs to come the ...\nThe the challenge we had a lead in had the ... data that we can take to the politician saying okay now you're rangers out and really bad shape change your policies now we have that information so that has to be done all kinds of Asian groups and\nI'm interested people need to come together to address the policy and number two is all the conviction group also need to invest more resources and the basic needs for example a piece of study clearly shows\nThat are the sites where and Jews are supporting contribution groups are supporting rangers rangers have better access to clean drinking water so maybe we need to\nInvest more into the basic needs of ranges and number three which is equally important is to create a lay in this above ranges how do we make\nAnybody in Asia and Africa do you have the feeling young young generation that it's

isn't it ... it is and and that's why we have to uh\nWalk with the national governments and to have to address these issues I think it is definitely one of the issue that has been raised by rangers but data bigger issues which needs to be addressed like a health and safety and the training and the ...\nI'm I'm pretty positive because this is the first time we have a quantifiable information we can go in law will be the Goldman and yet we didn't have this information right\nMany thanks for coming in to Rutgers finger WWF\n[noise] as far as young Filipinos was suing a British convict ... for
