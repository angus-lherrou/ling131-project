there's an effect\nBut I get such a rich data being in there and sometimes I Do that as well so I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nTo scientific putting that you don't want to back the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer that question unless they get really stuck\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box factory line in the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world down the cable bull to code is going on the late to legacy versions of pandemic\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules but then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise or you're trying to write a rule book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us as\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send a doctor translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguages from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you'd like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not if it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on the cover you just won't sell it in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo at least not kind of postal German ... games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games by that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then you're all games which was this interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict they had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively\nGot in the place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically haven't taken anything from you I just prevented you from getting something\nIs is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about four games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the
