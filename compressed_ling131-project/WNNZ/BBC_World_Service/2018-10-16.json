not much has changed when it comes to trivia and celebrity typical titled anymore it seems like a perfect remark on the ease with which generalist positions all business people mixed facts and fiction Crouse commented\nThe real truth or those that can be invented\n... controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes to mind\nAnd one can only imagine we'll have the sort of social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misused effects but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare ... many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that I'm the same age as the misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing ... crosses mind can be many things that could mean\nNot including a combat due to an editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and sought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for crosses all an indication that there was something deeply arise and the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so an critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floored pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden do publicity or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and he's on schools are fully religions to classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as you've said and he was a continued the bullying tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich they should be short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a truce or principle you've heard a few these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and late to publish them in book for several times\nBut he himself was all say aware of the limitations\nAnd aphorism never coincides with the truth it is either a half truth old woman do tricks\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows tell me got three and a white was say it's so important to him\nWhen I think at a had a really ambivalent relationship today as he had to he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't go out and and he very much disliked modern

the other choice some punt the out of circumstance and this is fascinating psychologically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town in what is now the Czech Republic and ... and be fool and and also because he was Jewish\nI think uh to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group or be that ethnic religious\nPolitical um I think that he saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities and I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with\nA group simply because one was born into it's simply because Kraus was born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly deeply ambivalent attitude toward his own or relationship maybe better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly booth law but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in sometimes never with the class to
