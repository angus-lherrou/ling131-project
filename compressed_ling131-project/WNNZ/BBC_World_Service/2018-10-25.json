turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits is almost perfect example of the pattern that you see\nThese Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again\nThey're going to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior account\nThe idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times meant spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentions etc\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics so particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nThat would kind of myself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged for the star wars universe on a daily basis that's\nMore than ... he's a research fellow at the center so deep still future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of evil and good imbalance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you see never before I had a stall will steal had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish and cost some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent freely was molten got serious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at directing Ryan jumps and\nSome of them actually behavior that look a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north happen it you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done that\nBut like they might be from Russia there\nWere sixteen hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been sort of themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt these states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer a tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society to take the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the choices that would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if molten and Josh our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nAs your says anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start\nUprisings but Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to be do you get picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you've seen pathetic to honest points uh you know the words if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you all very likely to see\nIt as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nTo the question that we raise the beginning of the program can we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against its information suggesting\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one\nBut what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole ... when he fits into a broader that\nOne very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's the ... campaigns\nBut at the end of the day does that really

companies make opioids\nWhich led to quite dribbling of prescribing in the United states from the mid nineties for over about Fifteen Years and that promise to level like about six times per capita of what you would see in Great Britain for example\nThe bad guys many people addicted to prescription opioids and then came the second wave was that heroin traffickers are reasons correctly that if they open up shop and a lot of American towns where they had previously not had a presence\nThere would be able to convert a lot of people from opioid pills to heroin and they were right and so then that started our second phase and then most\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the

scale we haven't seen in drug policy and in several generations\nI mean what does tend to know and why it has become so popular among uses\nFentanyl is entirely synthetic opioid that means that does not drive from the opium poppy you can make it in a lab\nYou can make it in your sink therefore many people can produce it and at the moment the main producers are in China which has a large chemical industry in a large pharmaceutical industry they're not tightly regulated\nAnd with the Internet may have been able to get markets where they sell directly to Americans and sometimes deliver it here in our postal service\nAnd the other thing they've done is established links with Mexico where they deliver federal benefits blended into the heroin which is very appealing to a heroin tracker because now you have a drug you can make justice strong at at a much lower price than heroin cost and then that has been important in the U.S over the U.S Mexico border\nSo serious is the problem now in the United states the Democrats and Republicans have come together to back this legislation in an attempt to a ... ... says one of the main at him and solve that legislation\nSo probably the first thing to note is it what is not there which is there's not an enormous amount of money the parties were far apart on that issue nonetheless they did find a lot of sensible policies that weren't expensive but are should be helpful things like\nAh reimbursing the training of people who specialize in addition having our Medicare program which is our program for senior citizens cover opioid addiction treatment which had not done up to that point\nOf supporting efforts to use a different insurance program called Medicaid for people who are in a jails and prisons because they're at extremely high risk of overdose and so\nThere's going to be demonstration projects where there'll be able to get access to health care before they leave prison and hopefully that will preserve their lives but there are many things like that that together I think will lead up to sending some lives even though is is not a\nTransformative piece of legislation\nSo how we get a measure the success of this legislation would it be the reduction in the number of deaths from drug overdoses\nThat would certainly be a very good outcome although it's you know only one of multiple outcome that ad or\nBeing addicted to opioids is very hard and people's health and also just they're functioning in daily life and their ability to you know hold a job or succeed in school or just play an active part in their families so also be measuring\nThe prevalence of addiction in the country and then we're going to major the prevalence of new addiction in other words if we're providing health care properly it's not just a
