a big money generator and now the creatures epic gang coming one player Brandon Lucas who was posted videos online on how to cheat while playing the game\nSo how big of a problem is that when the online video get within the online video game industry let speak to Ellie gets in video games journalist who joins us in the studio great to have you with is Ellie\nJust before we get into the the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how is it a global and a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game of down again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season politics about maybe ten dollars\nAnd that gives you access to serve cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing and but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in that sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that\nBut obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season ... and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon\nLucas so yes a brand new cars is accused of making these tax to the game and selling them\nAnd these are enabled prior to cheat basically so he's maybe ... ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim at them does it for you to medicate\nSo he's been sending these molds to the game online\nAnd for a upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yeah and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's where they basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that will you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nAs well this is in fact new 'cause his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says ... of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will pay\nAnd does this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fast food night ready to vote yeah they they had some people arrested I think in um uh this is a different game actually

let me take this week\nBecause everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what is happening as the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of northern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawal agreement\nIf you like it has to be completed on because remember it isn't just to eat you or\nMe as an Irish semi pie or the our government insisting that the United kingdom the British prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAn opposite of commitment that there would be no high board has no return to the past on the island of Ireland where patients that in March in fact the text on the table and draft withdraw divorce if you like in Greenland I'd be incomplete parts\nAre around and northern are and what have told me I have to say is that normally when we go see a certain level of papers produced I don't talk what's on your paper for example but I'm going to propose changes I guess what you want to agree with all of them but you take someone board that has not happened in these negotiations what is happening on this is a troubling part that I Hope we\nCan get over is that the u._k. side on that\nAnd I've listened to those arguments that ON Technology and they find may with\nWhat you said you would not be able to get ...\nBecause there's this isn't just about structure a technology this is about the psychology of that region remember that history takes a long time to him and indeed this weekend and the parliament's we have

and if that has to be some form of restored\nNo but then they'll do though is what are your words but what I'm saying it's what what what troubles me more and I tried to explain this to David David because one missing when he was a part of the the Brexit negotiations that to understand the psychological impact of breakfast you have to be there\nLive there and I lived and know what has happened and I think that's the power to the discussion that people aren't hearing\nAnd you have to obviously respect different views on that but at some point when when languages news blackout annexation not

don't seem to be focused on is that certain countries in the like Poland and Hungary legs are simply refusing to play by the new rules and accept basic values when it comes to things like a free media

are making the political weather and politics like yours in the center right that is being a gale in the white a block in Europe the European people's party\nThey are running ... of these people your

Europe who refused to accept the\nNotion of burden sharing when it comes to taking quotas off immigrants on a whole host of other issues including the creation of a new security force putting ten

that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface

or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus within Europe you worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power trains like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types than grows\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and

this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exist in one city busy business people five to ten times a year and\nWe all find ourselves in these cities where okay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now from those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic\nHow soon are we going to see this revolution you're describing\nSo I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and I'll caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a tax to you you're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\nEvery botch over ... go arrow hair on business
