better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's birds lowering emissions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLewis is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the bud and will be some jobs that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term caused doesn't equate long term Cleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLewis says what do we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies that will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nAre emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... cases I can just bringing about it for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise Mitt to degree Celsius rise DC isn't elements\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nPeople that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rise when I\nLooked to sort of question some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... and we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products ... have to be learned with one point five\nPowers to get for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they imagine a world that these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it was just want to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nBusiness reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and we're not asking the question was going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recon observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree you're forming business ... in the far future business um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for that\nDown to route and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed showed up they she the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and enter in a row welfare law where he wants\nTo come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together to that comment that money made and that they were just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we weren't able feeding tirade Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are the ... and\nThanks to all these work over the past ... years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he just making it easier\nThere isn't a global carbon price for instance the grade\nNo but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize there's been um scholars and political science working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've\nHad is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive than what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of applications on countries handle patient they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investment ... it is changing and that's the only said\nAgain we are doing and we have been doing is not enough ah as they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made also in the report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not it's not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I was only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about cautious important we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand assisting and ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar a local company installing roof ground amounts and do all access trackers helping households live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nNew infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive for we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about\nUs having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast and now think heat panel throughout the as an adult bubble Julius Steinbeck at ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will take a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas to exceed like us to look into you can ... the real story at BBC don't eat cake will treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the ... cost you can subscribe to just set for the real story and you'll ...\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at the grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power to read it to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world nuclear energy reporter for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now and Stu offshore wind about forty five donors and make it will turn on the show when the ... and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and Michael we'll tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nNuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it to low coping as quickly as possible and most efficient and cheapest way to do that is through new bills\nSo well to me well and I want to think about the politics which was becomes touch on a no the more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's IPC\nSo here's to any yours offering a special Korean\nSylvia lawn tickets for our Janice baby already hurting join us for an evening advancing kill folks

tickets no at any PR that [noise]\nThey have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is in slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would be swayed the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's as David said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judy it's time with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is affected leadership including in the United states and just happened not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believed defiance and they've used the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have that particular view on science but they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the government that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disown that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide to date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gave his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the colon stunning United States is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separates it from the optics and this is the president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said oh it's with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's C level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average Waltons and the goals were partly ... because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing costs to bearing the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the Trump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the u._s. hasn't gone with this\nEr here too many years offering a special person\nTo be a long term courage and his baby ... burning on us for an evening of ... and sipping some bubbly are aside court in speaking to them all up a U.S senator December first or a few close early bird disco before when they are resorting to\nGrab your tickets no any your [noise]\nTechnologies but Congress didn't go along with it Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about every developed well let's\nSee if we may ... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the group that he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies me already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then if\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficient see on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself would be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back\nTo the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused\nThe problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety to ... to ... and then five\nAt that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action ... no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to buy bonds\nThe mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with those fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or\nThe investments to the south and I think that's very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think for a country like India that demographic that this is\nMore difficult or easier to push through with an idea [noise]\nThe problem with democracy is of course is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other\nHand I think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science and I think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to

making time for us on the program this morning Jonathan ... the vial or just is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan un noting particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how easily this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course there's a lot of a local culture on local practices that involves quite close contact with a dead body and so\nIn past um outbreaks who've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial to get a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that if you can't get access to the communities\nAnd of course the other elements as well as there's a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected you isolate them and then you money to the contacts with those people and if any of them becoming infected you isolate them and by just doing this\nIsolation ... contacts monitoring\nCan very quickly bring an outbreak under control but of course you can't do that\nIf it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there is distrust of modern medicine\nAbsolutely and and there's huge mistrust and and again we've ... we had from Louis that there's a very effective vaccine which really well in the in the twin cities you know breaking guinea which is really where it was a given his first opportunity\nA and this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have been willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in that timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which is a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the region so so the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying that all of the areas got a boat or infections but there are a little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you spread your resources over great geographical area it becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about it so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question the one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like that the ... the the worry is a way that it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly\nThere's there is a a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but then is unlikely to spreads too much

together a hell of a ... a former prime minister of New Zealand to the former head of the United nations development program and detach hell I'm professor of energy policy a new college ...\nIt's one of those moments of truth I mean if you look what's happening globally we are miles from the project power that the I PCC recommend and we're a long way from the kind of measures they have in mind so we have but in China nearly one final ... gigawatts of coal now that system\nThey're building two hundred and fifty new ... stations in China\nAnd they're supporting two hundred coal plants outside

dot com warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest way to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other so if you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent and the and\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edge and it's driven by power from the sun and that power as always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most a\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third if ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest is heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequences at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nPatient at the energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heated momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequences\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the when some might build said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming a wind farm so at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because says mole solar energy coming through this because you don't get a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a ... but that would be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so when turbines are immensely better than coal and we have to\nBe carbon as the energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon I\nSuppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big effect you modeling is for lunch numbers of wind farms\nYeah but one when farmers and have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world that one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly venting the benefits of wind farms or what you know it's all together\nDon't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution in packs\nAnd given the very long time scale of of seem to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon twin power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed to the installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a wind turbine or a basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested some very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like a half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor is\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nMolested important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from some of the power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more watts per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you know have environmental and social impact nothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you\nAnd that a big important are finding I think is that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and he's climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at his
