they may Nineteen Twenty one has been described as one of the worst episodes of racial violence in us history when a white mauled descended on the area of Greenwood\nSetting fire to hundreds of black owned businesses and hung killing more than three hundred black people and leaving more than ten thousand\nAfter many calls for a detailed probe into what actually happened ... says mayor has said that there will not be an investigation into whether there are a mass graves in the city from that time\nThe announcement comes as Tulsa prepares to mark the hundredth anniversary of the violence I don't know for the Washington Post newspaper reported that there is still unsolved questions about what happened to all those years ago\nI spoke to Tulsa city council member of and that's the whole Harper was been behind this investigation encouraged it before going into the pro she told me what we know what we know about what happened a hundred years ago\nObviously there was there was much racial tension in the community and there was a black man named ... who worked in a hotel shoe shining and downtown Tulsa the story goes that he was actually in a relationship with a white woman who also worked in the hotel and the elevator\nThey would sneak off sometimes to see each other and one day they were caught and the story goes that the white woman they say screen right but in recent versions that that wasn't\nNecessarily the case that she didn't but at any rate the ratio is like to me to use that as an opportunity to destroy the black community the business community of black Wall Street this relationship is believed to be the cause of the new fancy dance which was which was a massacre\nAnd so the rampage began in Maine thirty one and Nineteen Twenty one what happened when the white mom descended on Greenwood\nWhat happened a massacre is what happened\nAnd rumor began that the mob would hang grilling there was a group of black men who were veterans of World War one who were armed who came back\nFrom war and knew how to protect themselves and so they went down to the courthouse and basically demanded that that he not be Hong later on they had to go back down there when they went back to the second time they were armed again this was because of the rumors are of\nThe attempt to kill the growling and the white mop got angry that the black community even had weapons or that they would even dare to protect themselves or protect their community or protect growling\nAnd a white gentleman grabbed the gun of a black gentleman and they're gone went off and that's when they say hell broke loose and they say over three hundred people were killed I think it's way over three hundred but we know that there were many many people who would never heard from again I guess historians or should I say white people\nWho wants to tell the story will actually that a lot of people just left and never return and I'm sure that's true in some cases\nBut natural and others and so that's why it's so important that as we come to understand and come to know where some of these grass mass graves are located that they'd be activated in that we honor them that we memorialize them but also to get a better sense of how many people were actually lost\nWas this something that was generally known in Tulsa did people talk over the years about the possibility that there could be mass graves after that rampage\nThat there could be mass graves absolutely yes we absolutely knew that there were inquiries network teams in the ...\nStreaming of New England public

I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we have to and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will still be producing in twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ... ships can convince of well\nI think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about oh yeah that's my point\nIs that if you have very pleased coal plants for example of gas\nOr even oil they will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener refers to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway\nI have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in the society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if you do both\nChristopher in this in this moment of transition it probably does make sense then driven the Baron see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out\nThere I think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's a strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty expiration if in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw next helpful and find out what's next dance and came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change and fulfill if I was in Oxford last week and I was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway as the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told him I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't afford making a plan\nTo get a false I feel ...\nI Would look at the time frame ... college but says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah if you will on it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a national\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from certified naturally grown fruit from Amherst offering berries ... their farms down small ones farm dot com\nBeef from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it remember that is based if we'll go to do a big\nBig job ... increasing renewables about six thousand percent another huge shoot his job ... ... on on how you could just mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement that ... you know it's not ... and we've been debating and those are\nThose numbers before but it's ... we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important ... understand ... the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built ... new investments are being made into ... energy and it's so many different types ... renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil ... competition with the down as a politician and in a country like new way which ... largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks ... itself has green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow ... does anybody else can ...\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become easy ...

people\nHas been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that\nWe're not talking about shutting down the production that we have today it's about whether or not what you invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kinda\nWe have to look ... what are our options what are the renewables for example\nWhere are discussing to mix in a more a bio the soul into our airplanes to make them more renewable but where do you get the ... do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from organic waste and it's\nPart of the circle but uh if not you have to

have to have the technology and who are going ... develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called actually knew now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green if it a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the cold class to make the word more ...\nGay

also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know\nWhat the harm is doing the

will come from renewable not to develop and you'd pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing

that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of a known in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so

Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to think you've made that I Know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got to go up on a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speed\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument is that you will see now that you and you will and then she will indeed be more cost effective than fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by producing and exploiting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much of Europe is generally grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulled from the way a little bit from Russia gave\nAnd does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president's there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an old uh gas\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the burn seat comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than older ... older to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat you can argue that new region energies clean as some people might not see reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new

that it's not a black and white picture\nThat it doesn't go to the carbon projects and if you see the court and Brazil has been originally seats to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now if the current prices high and Europe gas will exclude coal lifted hardly you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nOn there's a market inside Europe and the prices are being argued fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe too low cost when those prices are starting to rise then you gosh will push out cold enough push out renewables\nStale and would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to corporate pricing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are\nActually competing and you mentioned Russia and the situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway count we can't take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe in so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an ally investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments that\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe past twenty states and Europe committed to have Sierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but

correspondent who's been in studios in Washington Scott ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't quite there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said she was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information\nBut Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month\nAgo I remember I remember that I actually remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm
