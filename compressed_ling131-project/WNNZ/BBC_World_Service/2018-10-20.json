real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in case of these men spreading video\nThis really really fits is almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these\nRussian trolls or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their\nState funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of

people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and it's dark hair in three weeks before an election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society to take the star wars example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices that would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and setting up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\n... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media and the context of conversations about the me too movement and so won\nThe confidence is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that are well already divided\nIf you've seen pathetic to on this point uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive

yeah so it would pass a million which is as I was so great milestone for us having to one point two million\nI'm I mean I think this the first and biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it or even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know to put in context as as probably knew your seven or eight percent on Twitter\nUm you know we know process more than a million questions than answers every single month\nWhich gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fund system to you it's not a social system itself I value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for
