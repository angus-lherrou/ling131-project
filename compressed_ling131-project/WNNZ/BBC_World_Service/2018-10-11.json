advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society to to new places\nWhat are you going to mine from a space mining standpoint we are today focused on those resources that you can use in space so that you don't have to bring them with you\nAnd as in all things in transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things I Want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge do a who's who may one rival to win or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first target he's going to prevent yeah water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space\nAge for for you and I water\nCan in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets run on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like qualities that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen I\nCan get the ID 'cause there'll be a potential for stationed in space for a gas station in space there will be used pausing spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term ... because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from us\nFall cheaper than they used to run I mean the costs of fuel as a proportion of a an eleven month SpaceX rocket kind of shooting them spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the costs of the overall mission so he's he's a few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is this very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it will be permanent ... in Italy permanently and space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that show gets out to geosynchronous orbit or farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need us banks colony first I mean or at least an an actually from sort of industry on a ... a a population of them or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the theories of stepping stones that that sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects uh their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computers so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that\nQuestion that if you you go you got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to

I'm oversimplifying crazily really but this is about black holes having heat which means he dissipates black holes might disappear what happens to the objects\nAnd that's exactly what it's about we're trying to find a resolution to this problem and all the information paradox which is something that Stephen Hawking has been\nUm really obsessed with the last four forty as well say on this problem as essentially as you said what happens objects and they fall into a black hole wedded the information about these objects guys\nAnd usually we think it's on the outside you can't do anything about what inside the black hole and they want something flew into a black hole who information about it pays me last forever and what we've been trying to do is to and trace this information and find a way of recovering this information\nAnd how how far have you\nWell we're not definitely not that we we we want to step forward I'd say we've shown that and so there's a way of describing who lives in ... in a black hole and not schooled entropy and we've shown that that was a way that we can say this entropy\nAnd but this is this is just one step along the road\nAnd what's next them because I I suppose my next question is can you go further without that remarkable brain\nWell it's\nI mean it's going to be difficult even had a remarkable intuition and amazing inside and he would often and\nSort of

right and\nIt was just so useful having somebody has ... and intuition about how things should walk\nSays it will ... is definitely going to be different different and more difficult without him but what I'm saying he's still going to try the next step really is to try and walk out\nAnd if we can recover how much of the information we can recover and if this description of the information paradox could possibly um actually resolve this problem and if we could recover over to the information that's in a black hole\nAnd this is not just about a theory is that we're learning so much in this exploration about where we are going where a a climate where our universe is going\n[noise] yes I mean is that the black holes week considering all all real and that ... that sort of astrophysical
