is able to accept the money to provide services there can be not shoot at well OK it might not be perfect but\nMaybe it's the best we can I get you see but the question some male ... well why would they still allowed to operate by the government when they tell a scandal came to light today it was found that dozens of bills um\nAt least ten of them that it could be mall ... late ... some actually um ... well it may take in by this man named ... by him and had to to jump out of school why is it they still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging because anytime there's abuse there's always a community there's always an enabling elements from the people who either knew or should you know one of those who are benefiting and then didn't take the steps to safeguard\nThose who are more vulnerable but one of the girls to report on our stories story when we spoke but he spoke to her she she'd probably she'd been abandoned by the organization and this is a girl that is very hard like one of the girls who had gone through all of it but it's been great enough to testify\nThat that she regrets it that's fine because she'd been told by the organization but she did everything would be fine but then she felt she was little\nI think the key things in a member and all of this is that there was about but I'm sure about the ... more than the resources to West Point that weren't coming otherwise they wouldn't organization that was that thought the help of the food that all those who've struggled the most even those who perhaps felt they were treated badly there there were there was

seems more than likely that the Saudis responsible they no definite proof that yeah\nThere is no the Washington Post says and U.S intelligence community believes that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and knew about this operation it's unclear whether it was intended to be something like this and it could have been a basically an abduction gone awry which is bad enough but yes it's looking very

see anything that dramatic I think that there is some sort of sort of naming certain Saudi officials are of Arab on making a very difficult for them to travel and own things abroad at least in Europe

be the time to explain what you did if this is as bad as it seems man it's a kind of crazy thing to do the things that you could send a team of Fifteen people into another country and not have that other countries' intelligence service find out about it so in that respect it was a blunder as well as a crime and\nI think that the Saudis have to understand that the United states is the most powerful member of the U.S Saudi alliance and there are certain rules you can't cross in that respect\nAnd really the big point here is that you do not want the Saudis to act the way that we expect the Russians the Iranians are the north Korean staff we want the Saudis to be sort of on in in this general space of course there on the U.S side when it comes to Iran and the middle east\nAnd saying that the U.S is the most powerful the U.S government will say mindful of the ... one imagines the fact that they have\nThe ... relationship with the Saudis at the moment do you think that's one reason

states and Saudi Arabia or our allies that is true and\nAs allies that is a different kind of relationship then to countries that are in our adversaries with us I mean I sort of goes without saying my point is that there's a place where you can make it very clear that you're not sanctioning behavior that you make it awfully I think the u._s. hatched in that stuff and they have\nTo make a very

standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jobs that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten ... some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an adequate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increase of seeing an extra ... prices seem that you can get another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLewis says what do we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies that will give you the other example we also know that\nThe fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've\nAre emerging seventies all their high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... cases I can just bring you back from them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um\nI look to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television we're seeing massive increase in the months of renewables that we vote in the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products ... have to be aligned with at one point five powers to get for example I can see that and I'm In the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for they say look ahead and they imagine a world that these climate change the climate is breaking down\nAnd they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is as real political will to make these changes now\nYou you just want to us today is that when I Walk into question who is going to pay to\nFor this one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on the business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already we can observe them today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree of forming business ... in the far future visit 'em one point five current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown to route and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policy that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law\nWhere he wants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and that they were just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we weren't able to see the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and\nThanks to all these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly\nSo he says making it easier there isn't to global carbon price for instance disagreed no but there is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize there's been um scholars and political science working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive than what we're seeing now is that an increasing number of application from countries indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's this investment ... it is changing and that's the only said\nAgain we are doing and we have been doing is not enough as they see reports is reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all saying that report about\nMaking sure that the most vulnerable or not heard it's not just necessary for ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons okay only in that situation do you get the support you need\nBoth you know so when we talk about culture's important that we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there were three big trends are going to happen\nRegardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not and we have a choice whether we make it's sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nContinue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast and now ... panel throughout the as an adult bubble Julius Steinbeck at ... case had\nA ... year we were a gal will take a short break ... just to remind you let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics he likes to look into you can ... the real story at BBC ... or ... or tweet me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have the ... cost you can subscribe to just set for the real story and you'll ...\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at the grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way off a\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed nuclear power out relatively clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy reporter for this year's shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind is about forty five donors in making ...\n... which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so and you just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electric bio energy supply and make it a little coping as quick as possible in the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nFive investigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoint is one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deal with serious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nThey're charge from the United nations about his level but I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that they thought this could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck it with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that little warming is happening really fast\nTo argue for weaker a vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on the science what they do have the view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not disowned it it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't know the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives his reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts all becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industry um we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because of sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the Gulf well partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the u._s. hasn't gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs to see her all at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nLow carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas these idea that there are benefits\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in

developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies me already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda as much more to talk about renewables but the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health\nAnd so that itself would be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back\nTo the politics because then the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay her in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries that are doing the knock must take action fist no it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space for action so it\nIt's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north tried to convince a pension funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I thought about a good idea to shifting the problem effect right and so I don't even developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through with an idea\nOf a democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there is a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if he can get social movements

scientists in New Zealand and I spoke to one of them he is professor jak behind them and from the University of counter brand new Zealand well most of the connection between herbicides on to kill weeds and antibiotic resistance\nThe surprise at all all of that is that as you say we expect herbicides to kill plants and we expect antibiotics to kill bacteria but\nThe chemistry of these different kinds of of agents and drugs are such that bacteria perceived both types of drugs as toxins\nHerbicides are not particularly good toxins for the ... the bacteria that we study but the bacteria I don't know this and they react to them as if they were good toxins\nBecause these are for toxins because herbicides or poor toxins they don't kill the bacteria so you'll get a sub lethal affect\nThe bacteria would respond to these herbicides like turning on genes for bombs that remove all those toxins from inside themselves to outside\nThat pre adapted bacteria foreign exposures to toxins that are much more potent like antibiotics so that herbicides in a sense aren't vaccinating the bacteria against the antibiotics\nAnd this is happening this protest is on the way the most harmless of sounding places anyway ... thanks loans where people play with the dogs\nThat's right wherever herbicides and antibiotics may come together and they come together and these places because for example
