pretty much over state my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old\nSo hearing that story what it really says to me is you know this sort of

[laughter]\nThat's right and in many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and is now being put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader and his Communist Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the growth of alteration intelligence and virtual reality so the state is using tech for surveillance in China much\nMore than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for us we'll just surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and on that it's not just the financial details or your rent\nA criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China this anti corruption

go on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave and to Jane rises and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo what did he superstitious or a tribute to kind of belief come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process fees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are\nHere for a reason so for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so\nIt's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program in ... that was a bit of the museum about food do and um but producing very cruelly brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything bad happening to them\nYou're describing now is building on a different ... which is ...\nScreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit ferment averaged with a farm standard for sixteen bay road opens six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nYes if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation of your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is\nIdea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources or sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintained that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nWant you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three chosen okay good now you can keep your ...\nOr you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what\nDo you go full you should go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile that could really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first intrusion system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but\nThe cost of ignoring the intuition that she was just going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one that the big cost so I'd rather avoid does not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you are having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying it I mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay
