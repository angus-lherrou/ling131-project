research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women so much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the

run parallel experiments we run experiments where we're stimulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment in which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there in stimulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those

point we have pretty high confidence and those types of events and likewise cold temperatures the reduction in cold temperatures strings cold temperatures spell ... those are being reduced as well\nOr where it becomes harder is in terms of assessing precipitation assessing drought I'm assessing even smaller scale features like tornadoes that right there is where the science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because\nThat's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that we have to be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\n\n\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something rather comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in some tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event\nOr we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was the most precipitation overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increase to due to climate change\nCome very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great to long can you heard of this kind of event do these very specifically giving ... to the amount that the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing a slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability ever turns right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that

one three valleys solar dot solar\nExplained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures that fueled the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform over all the ocean even in the north Atlantic and put their warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that there had on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have\nOn moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe a particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the U.S that the we actually have a pattern change of the SST that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy this year while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming\nCan suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\n[noise] it's marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nSea
