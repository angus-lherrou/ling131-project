legalization than Canada\nCanada who is is only the second country over to Europe wide to to legalize cannabis Klein legalize why this decision well the reasoning\nBy the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian youth miners teenagers and so on so they said look we are going to try and bring in this new\nStrict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective if the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls set of regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province but federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are will be able to\nPurchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he signed some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous\nProvince you can use it offends the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nThat is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams there actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison\nNow of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so there are concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again\nBoth organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush about the possible boon to the economy that this development could have what are people thinking about that in the months up to legalization here in\nCanada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada's statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spend rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on a candidate\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's some it's among supposed to do it all the countries will be watching very closely what they\nAbsolutely ... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drug on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking it decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government\nIs able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously other countries looking
