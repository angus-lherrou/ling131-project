anything but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then and the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of

reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be\nScientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to capture compromise is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now [noise]\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent mountain across\nThe problem with these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists have and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the rent is really boring things the more ... and do things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machines with fans in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now they cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they've been suffering they called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove common from that and say oh why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers that politicians and campaigners environmentalists really worried about because if people think there's going to be a solution ten years down the track they'll keep flying they'll keep eating meat to keep driving cars they do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is common capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nYeah there are lots of different things going on the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do far a station that the\n... lengthen the time to time the trees grow or they changed you know when they have a massive kilometer you fire or something they plan pretty quickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know holding on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that course all the big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshlands Neal to see if you can protect those there may things source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per common and that is really really cheap\nThe bigger problem of course the long term is we don't have enough of them you know they find the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller take is happening and it's cheap and I'll just report things we do more but\nHow do you incentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture yeah\nBoth China and India are taking all these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also on the sea building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief among the richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it then there will be able to either share that technology but Indian China nothing really happened so far and there are a number of intellectual property questions about all the the big challenges\nStreaming of New England public radio

for long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that stuff said what's airborne they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debates have\nSo babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea excessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they read fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney and which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing so babies are in control of all and crying that is babies don't handle that you and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for\nHours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crying\nThey sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of a week\nAnd what kind

don't have much time has to might have so let me ask you some quick questions a pivoting toward you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particularly the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand all them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke

we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where where\nAre you in your car here because we have a new I don't think it'll take me straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reported sources saying quote\n... I had the meetings with\nUh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have coffee talk quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one consideration for or or what is going on it's a lot more detail than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador out you know it's very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then you think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are uh in in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process Africans do\nBone and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor its success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nPart final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take much to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate in the that the African people want that process despite that threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where the weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a

weekend\nI'm a little puzzled as to what the objective is to reduce carbon that's fine but you have to consider that a sweeping ban\nMay cause producers are manufacturers to come up with solutions that are even more harmful to the environment\nLet's airplanes because a lot of plastic inside the cabins or airplanes that may never get re is is that single use and what will it be replaced by you know metal of some kind\nOf also and takes resources to make that metal just like those plastic takes energy and it's heavier says the consequences that may cause the airplanes and get less gas mileage so to speak and have a bigger carbon footprint so those people\nWho carry around the metal knives and so in that bag when they go to work so they don't have to use a plastic one that doing the wrong thing or they\nDon't think so I don't think that's quite the same thing I think a void in the use of disposable plastic there's not a bad thing to do however I don't know that just banning it out right across the board is necessarily going to achieve the most desirable result\nWhat itself out try it it it's just in the European Union and surely that's a good start\nNo outright inside the European Union what I'm saying is that\nAlternatives we'll have to be found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling it or just throwing it in a landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single used plastic glass bottle you can take back to a shopping refill and using many times as you want at home I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of all bottles in the United states that are about twenty five years\nWell there are a lot modem in Europe I can tell you\nWell that's fine they're also costs

sweet thing is I mean if you if you introduce legislation to ban single use plastic seats\nIn August ... doesn't do did a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion I don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban should such measures they expanded so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well as\nIn European Union they're certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right now what Julie ... forks or\nAre going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature however one wants has to be judicious about this and think it hurt\nYou have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem right then you decide to just you know\nBlindly regulation on you know something this is a good example of why ... ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man they add a little better for people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic activist to science shows that you are damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk makers\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single used plastics probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation 'cause they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more arms the environment because in in the nature and the way you use\n[noise] Peter Morici who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that ...\nWell [laughter] I understand why he's saying about having to look at the energy footprint of alternative but I Do think that environmental degradation on climate change\nThat we see in the world today is such a pressing issue and we need sweeping 'em urging action scale on this and of course looking at plastic is not new and we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya\nMarch ... and Morocco and of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags and I think it's a very welcome development my slight um reservation is around\nThe ... plastic strollers in particular and I've been reading the concessions from disability rights ... about this and who took about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws\nUm in order to be able to drink liquids and\nKind of use metal ones or\nPay well I well actually other materials that just paper on

petted soldiers with repeat to use 'em so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ban on plastic strollers um but by and large I think it's a\nBeyond that it it's a welcome development and I'd also like to let not just a single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's been the oceans as well\nSo I was really struck by the high proportion of plastic in in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew I Know this is an issue close to your Hodge it's a

plastic package a way of making our own contribution to that so I think for those of us who are extremely concerned about this issue it's actually very refreshing to hear\nA political the politicians are an on any political institutions in Europe taking strong action on this\nUm but there's things sort of a ground breaking it will will cry yeah it is it's it's a directive of this age is not yet nor of course but hopefully it will lead to legislation which will force industry to change 'em but there's also things we can do as well I don't know if you've come across ... brakes\nThese incredible innovation that's being used by ... yeah that's right it's it's they're being used in South Africa or in parts of Southeast Asia or essentially you take your plastic bought her off and

the insects inspired driving\nYou can imagine it as a robot it as a central body and then for links to on each side of the robots and nice wings unlike in an airplane there are not fixed but they are actually fly think there are beating Seventy times per second and this has to keep the robots in the air so the wings they produce lift forest that carries the robot\nNot only that we control the we motions off each wing individually and this serves for control of the robots and this is similar to what insects are doing\nInsects also modified doing motions so that they can steer their flight\nLooks is the actual mechanism for slapping the way\nWe have to use ... we have to then transformed is a rotating motion into flooding by a transmission which is a small linkage mechanism\nAnd when I think a human made wings flapping machines and this is an awful thing to say but I'm visiting those old CPA Italians movies at least is all stress flowing contraptions before in the end we just

and you can imagine tasks like observations are explorations of a difficult to reach places for future we can scale these robots down\nAnd they will become even more efficient as the technology will improve who will be able to make these robots smaller and smaller\nThan we would like to upgrade them not as a single unit but as a swarm if you have many of those for a ... for example you could think of applications like a robotic pollination in greenhouses\nI guess we have the problem that these are dying out we didn't know exactly why robotic pollination might be one of the applications",
