author of a run from the sky the making and on making of the world's newest stage it's a book about South Sudan struggles he's been speaking to James commonly last team won't win room\nGets done many people both close observers and folks that were new to it you know the you for a kind of that moment in two thousand living with sort of celebrated the world around and I think part of the problem was that people saw that as the finish line of the south Sudanese project this kind of unprecedented experiment and international state building and\nMoved on rather than as the beginning of the project\nWhich took him out of the international community in particular don't so much the south Sudanese maybe you are well both\nSo I think I think national and international actors have some soul searching to do about this but yeah I think South Sudan had an unprecedented coalition of support both among the Africans in the region but also among the wider world not least in the west among European countries in the United states\nIn the book he made the argument that America sometimes described as the midwife for South Sudan's independence too close to the south Sudanese to the people who go to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese source why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role a huge role in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace then unqualified belief in the righteousness of the cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's in the U.S ... supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThe dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan this little support now as America's gone too far away but come to disengaged\nYeah I think we've swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there is a lot of interest about this and the Trump Administration and I think we see that playing out on a day to day basis now we're the United states is a two absent from the scene\nYou'll say critical says the

alternately failed to produce a a real political transition and South Sudan and I have some of the same doubts now that I did then I think this deal\nIs important if it can stop violence in the immediate term if it can allow humanitarian access if it provides an entry point for the international community the best peace deal in the world won't be implemented without the political will I think we need to think in five and ten and Fifteen year terms and for me that means partnering with youth in South Sudan means partnering with\nThe thirty something a little tired of politics should be ... relatively army\nTotally locked out of politics and have been for too long waiting generational change in their own country I Do have optimism about South Sudan and it's in many ways tied to that generation and so I think the Trump Administration I think western governments are think outsiders would generally do will do to address the immediate term but to start to invest and partnering with a new generation and South Sudan\nIt'll you'll dealings ways that governing elites who came from a rebellion you ended up as politicians despite themselves in some cases did you get much feeding that they wanted the best country that I prepared to go on their own interests and I'm looking at the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best intentions of their country at heart but\nThey failed to seize this incredible opportunity there had both apple oil reserves oil reserves that many states would kill for and they had a remarkable reservoir of international goodwill and so they had a real opportunity and I think\nBecause of that history because of they were in many ways disconnected from their own population because institutions went there and there was opportunity for corruption sadly I think they failed in that\nIn season that opportunity and I think some of them are repentance some of them have seen what's happened as a result of those failures others I think or not and\nThat in many ways is why I think generational change is the\nFundamental ingredient in a long term transition to a piece in South Sudan\n... from the sky to

between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred and sixty two members follow them\nOver all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's it going to work\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time it might be really inefficient to happen there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada

Paris climate accord he doesn't like\nInternational agreements and he was complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim\nChina similarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose anything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate\nOne of the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of ... looking at international trade the U.S has actually

well I've been talking to Daniel ... for the political news site in the U. S. and I asked him how he sold President Trump would react and he could lose his story\nI guess I Would say that the president he makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know when is it going to stop and so I think you know Trump was elected primarily\nA in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his promises to stop illegal so he has said that we should have a heart with immigration policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of\nShowing for people who are clearly clean desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line his rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with the midterm elections approaching sauce do you think it would squeeze the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when he was talking about an unknown middle Easterners\nIn a way in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans or moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated fear mongering that is not even true and\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still thirty percent of Americans\nBut for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general may or June not approve of and so they don't want immigration policy to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very

euphoric high of that moment or two dozen living with sort of celebrated the world around and I think part of the problem was that people saw that as the finish line of the south Sudanese project this kind of unprecedented experiment and international state building\nMoved on rather than as the beginning of that project\nIn the book he make the argument that America sometimes described as the midwife for South Sudan's independence go too close to the south Sudanese to the people who grew to 'bout freedom as the south Sudanese source why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular put an absolutely critical role in huge role in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in a righteous Minnesota cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the SP alum supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped the

each\nBetter or work is doing something that seems obvious but that a lot of\nPolitical candidates won't do which is rejecting money from corporate political action committees he's saying that his campaign is only going to be funded by contributions from individuals and that if he can win his election it will only be because of individuals' making contributions\nThat case I hang on a second that you're saying that he's actually raised more money by saying he will not take any money from the corporate sector [noise]\nHe'll take money from people who worked for corporations but he won't have any of their political action committees contribute he doesn't want to serve in the Senate if it means that corporate tax got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help him when\nDoes this reflect then as soon as soon as I'm In American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWatch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that accept small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that he was elected

donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better or ... is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nIs being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because the architect\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north happen you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done\nIs actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you can buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the streets that's exactly\nRight they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are fish they run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawn facts are official intake points for people to come and volunteer\nAnd help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own and if he does when it was suddenly spend the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaign very differently than anyone else has thought possible\nAnd I think the true test of better works legacy will be\nHow different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on so far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not yes the two best\nSpenders right now on digital expenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nFederal courts his car he losing according to the opinion polls by a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment ... do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out voters that are not being picked up in the polls Ken you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nThough in terms\nOf ensuring our forty three [noise]\n\nThree Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties they were all may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls does the money even matter that much Donald Trump offer all under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research I have a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools and ask and applied laboratories science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nShould they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lot of time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters\nAnd so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists uh what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nDoes TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much uh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of that you're a viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and it's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to we're going to regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in

and this is tailored for you so it's a picture it's a film of you washing your so yeah it's most of washing my own hands the way I wash every day [noise]\nI Do wash my hands quite often like for example of an infant touch my mobile I feel like okay should I wash my hands before I eat anything because I was just touched my ...\nEven if I go to ... to make sure I wash my hands either assigned

how close are great I get it off to how many circles came up on the screen and that brings you really weren't paying attention and you were actually engaged in it because exactly and then it asks you\nHow you feel after you've watched yourself wash your hands and now how disgusted whole anxious you for your\nShow but also the same set of questions to measure like is it better for watching video or was it was after watching with you\nOh you're washing your hands as much as you were before the trial or or do you think it's had some sort of lost in effect\nIf I keep on watching videos of washing my own hunch all the time they're ... my mind I was like okay that said you didn't wash your hands shot so I can see a little bit different it's like okay I don't need to wash my rationale that says\nWell I've been a token to professor Barbara Sahakian one of the developers solve the brain training at punt who's findings to the period in scientific reports\nMany of these people wash their hands so many times a day that they can damage than some of them get so extreme they put bleach on their hands and because they're worried about the contamination touching things that other people have touch maybe getting some disease sometimes they can't even lead their own house because they're worried that anything they touch\nWell you know a contaminate them\nI'm wants treatments\nCurrently exist so there's two main treatments one is cognitive behavioral therapy and it's a special for them it's called exposure and response prevention so in that therapy\nBay as psychologists would actually ask you to sort of maybe ... around the edge of a toilet seat maybe even put your hands in the toilet and then they wouldn't let you I'm going wash your hands so what happens is anxiety goes way up and these people that you can imagine because they're worried about this contamination\nBut eventually it subsides and when they can't wash their hands anymore they realize that actually there are right there is nothing wrong\nSo it isn't effective treatment and many people but not for everybody and also as you can imagine many people don't want to undergo that treatment because it's too stressful for them to do it and it causes too much anxiety\nAnother treatment is the selective serotonin uptake inhibitors these drugs\nThat I used also in the treatment of depression the Sri starts like Prozac but again\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nBut yours you maintain your brain training app is more effective was the thinking behind is\nWell the thinking behind it was that festival also when you have to do the C B te therapy you have to go into a specialized hospital I have to make an appointment it's expensive sometimes it's an inpatient treatment\nAnd that now with the new technology we should be able to use these new technologies for you know developments in the twenty first century I'm going to a meeting on those therapies that at the society an academy and medical science has [noise]\nAnd we should really use this new technology and get it into play and the idea behind it was well perhaps if you watch yourself washing your hands it will substitute for doing it yourself\nAnd the other one was to put something akin to the cognitive behavioral treatment of exposure in response prevention on the app itself so there were two different types of Aspen both seem to be effective actually\nSo you're getting the person to to reflect if you'd like ... uh yes\nSo they they really when they look at the ... some of them said you know I I used to not be able to go on the bus but now I can go on the bus because if I get worried that have touched something I just can look at the uh myself washing my hands on the up and I feel fine I'm not anxious stressed or anything like that\nAnd then with the other one um which is more akin to the CBP therapy\nThey would say things like I used to be able to uh not be able to touch them been or use a cloth twice so you have to throw it away if I was wiping accounted but now I realize that actually there's nothing nothing wrong with using it twice renting it out or when I catch up and I don't need to rush away and wash my hands\nSo what sort of says has have you had with those using this some brain training camp\nSo we have a certain measures of this kind of obsessive compulsive symptoms and they were reduced by about Twenty one to twenty five percent so that was a good reduction because they've only use the F for one week stuff they used it for longer it might even have a better effect but that was quite a good reduction\nAnd also it affects their ability to a\nCognitive ability so they're not so rigid in their cognitive thinking anymore they're not so much for all they can sort of
