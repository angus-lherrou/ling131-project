Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... tradition you could ... Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that the estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern is in uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the the surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and I believe that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a change in the U.S that the we actually have a pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that is actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes Mississippi interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still fall out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six twenty seven degrees Celsius so there's a very large region in the Atlantic\nThat sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turn into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\n[noise] it's marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater alarm they may have been implicated in many events that have ... to the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting sauce and most some is recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia\n... more than ... eleven hundred lifters joined the any PR family last week thank you so very much if you didn't get a chance to step up you can join anytime by making a contribution at our website any P.

them to take notice of what they're saying\nYes I think that's why the science as you're making a big player saying yes it does cost a lot of money but essentially what you're doing is you're bringing forward investment you might have to make any way and if you don't make that investment now if you don't cut those emissions now I Know and they're very expensive to do that\nYou'll be paying more down the line because basically they're saying we're going to have to use machines to some kind of come from the atmosphere their own tried on tests as a nobody knows how much they will costs in the

the newly released report from the IPC the on the difference of one point five degrees warming versus two degrees warming and if I could say so it makes a world of difference\nHalf a degree makes a world of difference because it is two different worlds that we would be hiding for one is a world of increasing disaster and destruction\nThat would completely overturn out the geo political stability

President Trump saying he's pulling away from the Paris climate change agreement even though there are other countries who are still waiting to commit it's still a challenge is it not to make this possible it is still a challenge\nIf it weren't to challenge the countries would not have commission this report we always knew that this was going to be a challenge the report is basically there to give us the numbers that we can then analyze and compare what kind of a world do we want\nAnd yes absolutely there are some national political leaders around the world right now that are completely blind both to the harm that they're bringing upon themselves and upon the world but also completely blind to the benefits\nThat we would all rape including their national economies are in fact perhaps even\nEspecially their national economy's\nSo you know it's about blindness is not about do you believe in climate change no\nThis is about these are the facts\nNobody asks you do you believe in gravity right whether you believe in gravity or not gravitational pull actually has an effect on your body so this is not ideology this is not fiction this is not a mess\nThis is this a scientific assessment of what the two worlds are that we are being faced with\nAnd sooner or later everyone is going to have to wake up to the collective responsibility of ensuring that we all moved towards the better world and not to the way worse world\nBut we certainly know what's happened to the way in which facts are interpreted or even at the way in which Fox all presented so audience logically there is an uphill battle in terms of the way in which the United states under President Trump is framing the conversation\nYes and that is really the tragedy the fact that this has descended into ideology is really nothing short of pathetic and completely irresponsible because it is not an ideological discussion about what kind of a world do we want to inherit toward children and our grandchildren\nWill do individuals need to do because clearly this isn't just about political will there is a huge amount that individuals can do if they do it either by themselves all on math and then it becomes a collective shift\nAnd exactly so for things that we can all do I actually quite quickly out first give up meat because the production of animals leads in many ways to climate change
