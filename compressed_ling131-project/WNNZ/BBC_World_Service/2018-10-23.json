found a cure for a drug resistant strain off tuberculosis new combination of drugs have successfully treated more than Ninety percent of patients who had this film of the better movies\nWhich is good news considering the book you know it's just it's just the world's deadliest infectious disease last year it killed at least one of ... million people around the world poker pulled up from ... from the international union against tuberculosis among disease\nStudying ... significant because it's a country with an extremely high burden of the most difficult forms of tuberculosis so we called extensively drug resistant tuberculosis or ex T. R. T. V.\nAnd that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis that is one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the capital and they were able to find that when he's very very difficult patients that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent\nIs one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis in the last Fifteen Years so um this is a ... he's a big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this and it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug you must have at least to effective drugs so just shouldn't developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\nSo ... so it's about the only way to beat the book you know it's just just to have one drug and combined with the others was does that mean he was simply a case of mixing a cult sounds gathering the right way and then eventually you know get bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drug that we already know about and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon we're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of trading tuberculosis in all its forms\nWhy is the book you know it's just so from aids points of view so successful\nTuberculosis is successful it's it's an organism that can ... lived in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years maybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy eat may never even actually develop the actual disease it'll just like dormant in your body\nAnd some ... and then other times if your immune system is weak for example when you had HIV when you have diabetes and other conditions that where your immune system goes down certain cancers like kidney disease that can actually make the organism\nCome alive again to actually develop to actually develop the disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to the rich countries is correct\nI think that the tuberculosis as a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states the the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially in the middle income countries like South Africa China\nIndia needed the countries that have some of the highest burdens or tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich country they're becoming richer and with that becomes a better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to tuberculosis because\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher so that we can have the thinking but it's like putting fire on something where you're tuberculosis his comments and now you're going to have diabetes adding fuel to that fire and I can see a a gross of the tuberculosis\nWe're so much for the last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be Nineteen

have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the background a level of tuberculosis very low even when you when you have obesity and diabetes in term\nIt's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor ... for countries like India South Africa China the priority will be to fights obesity would die if we'd lifestyle and through that way you can be tuberculosis\nAnd that's one of the way that you were able to beat tuberculosis I mean ultimately what you need for tuberculosis it to make sure that people are treated
