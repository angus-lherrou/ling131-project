to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie and as it that's not iconic it's a very American desert but\nAnd the south of India to see in\nWere literally millions of women come together our daughters\nOne moment [noise]\nThey all

a little bit about ... and that that area of India\nYes a ... is a it's a beautiful place it's on the southwestern coast very near the tip of India and its tropical it's humid uh their beach towns and at this time of year it's very very hot\nAnd and tell me about this ... what are these women doing [noise] it's\nA pilgrimage where millions of women traveled to one city to cook a dish together and that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and the the trains are filled\nWith women starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\n'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually they have a bad bet is filled with all of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ...\nAnd the entire ceremony revolves around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up and what they're setting up our\nA makeshift hearth of three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're going to how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million\nWow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to uh got us yeah that's the\nWay that they refer to her is to call her mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this at this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... collie and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a uh getting figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and the as millions of women are setting up makeshift harvests with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing thought um and tell me about what they're cooking\nSo on the morning that this happens um women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um\nThey dress often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the ... for the ... and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moment all around the city there speakers set out women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking so what's actually really incredible about this is this now you're you're walking around the city all of the smoke is all over the place and everything smells like Vern rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky on the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise]\n[noise] yeah and they're really cooking so tell us when it's a rice porridge yes so they basically they start off they have a a

usually in three handfuls\nAnd then they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all the pots are bubbling over this sort of steamy what's beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it says the rice gets soft like any special ed and then at the end\nAnd they add all of these seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are finding some you know some women say that you have to add to key because he is a purifying a sort of symbol um many women ... there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which doesn't enter find plump shutter and uh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf\nAnd they wait for a place to come around that can take hours instead of in this interim time they eat lunch days that are on their each other's shoulders at a map and then when the priest cans they all get behind their hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the ... holy water over there they're pots and\nThen they're free to yet and this moment it's so beautiful because it's a thing that I've been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take us ... they chase each other's hung

Ecuador [laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come back with her one day 'cause it's a it's credibly beautiful but uh what should we talk about\nWell here's the problem I I we live in a very hot place\nOr do we get a real like a nor'easter like eighty five degrees and that's all we put on a sweater or it it is very hot and humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt and not\nNot so much because saw blades preservation but just to keep it dry and ... and so we\nWe really are very careful with uh we don't have we store things and one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of should do is just my wife and I we we love it when in fact we call it ... ... am and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous\nChunk and so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we ... we should just put it in the freezer for now and she put it

with solar power all energy solar dot com\nJuice and you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be acquaintance um for more you know sort of to some as it was before and maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think a lot of doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you have a deadly force yourself you know a deli nearby may consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo you ... slicing thin\nYou know packages or however many places you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase about too much damage\nThat said the only thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally a fresh per se um but something about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask is cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably wants to pursue it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around me and then you can sort of secrets you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise] um [noise] you can cut it into chunks\nAnd use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with green beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a song the\nCure ham if you're if you're not in position to be able to enjoy it and\nIt's sort of like silky thin sliced a state\n[noise] no I assumed since sliced phase of its life has over it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder even\nWhy even just putting the singing the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole time and she would happen\nYou know I have never done that but I\nIs I think right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose [laughter] so hey try it and I'm sure someone in Italy with like rolling their grave when they heard someone doesn't Stewart procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure\nThe texture of all the flavor on a beautiful cure flavor is going to be there so if you do that and the slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm white salty so of course you you want to think about that when eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor or larger dish I'm set of cooking the whole thing by or you ... you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hams they do exactly that with its cured it aired dried\nAnd then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slices indeed it than you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not and use that as a stock or is that a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it you know as a flavor an answer for you know vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a dish called ... one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things they should do is put a big\nPiece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bacon square into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so it kind of like that idea of mine yeah for sure\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "14"}
