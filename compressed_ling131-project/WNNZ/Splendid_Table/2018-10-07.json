studies her and truthfully it was kind of the inspiration for our approach for the show using different voices and showing a sliver of what she meant to\nServe Franklin as a writer and educator was the person behind them\nHe's our thanks so much for coming into its a pleasure France\nSo I Am really interested in how you got interested\nIn the work of a new Lewis I think we're both missing bone that we never knew her personally and we never met her I was right\nBut are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eat when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by ms Lewis called what a southern\nAnd in this essay on this Lewis positioned the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly striking moment as someone who was interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food\nIt was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I I had no idea she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and fell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with a notice this editor Judith Jones who's the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on cut in Rhode Island and yes that Iran now Frank fantasy legit yeah I'm leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author English writing I should say ... and she published and Lewis is most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about work it became apparent to me that her book that you did with mess Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away\nFrom working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that starts to attention and pay attention moments in in Judith Jones as career\nOf what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement a civil rights Vietnam War has come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity yeah what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans south through the perspective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who've come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of ... when she only direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Jim down your throat and and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it and her and your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it in that when you when you say that came late\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses on farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\n... ... this is a work of African American history and the American south and it's a really giving dignity to that portrayed as an entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture mhm\nSo I\nI wrote a story about a new Lewis a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up in and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I didn't I didn't think it before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of the country cooking as being a with a political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as oh just a sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds of people who ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community should grow up to them where in slave mhm if they were freed slaves at one that's right and I think if you think of that story you imagine a story that was one of hardship and\nYou know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society of the most beautiful community it was a life will duty literally children are singing in the book yeah and I thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say\nHey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine you started as a wrong that's right and that's\nA profoundly political thing it's a massive corrective to so much of what had been written in what continues to be written that a life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures\nThat was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life with a rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it and and and things that we think that's sort of still is a luxury food meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms for anything in this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they created for themselves\nYeah ... they're literally making souffle is in their kitchen literally yeah [laughter] that's right and there's also this fearlessness to it too and I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you spotted the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nJust really incredible image of and they take the bladders out when they blow the butter up like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later if I can you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally ... and but also I remember reading it and the way she describes\nThe hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described hunting hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in\nA nearby community to hers who was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's ... [noise]\nI'm In the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly um I'm actually wrote them in that scene but\nI think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was selling lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible Frank missing much present to deal with whether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time and and that she was going to see it sort of ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nEast at that time she said nothing at all\nIf she was gonna open her mouth and play pen to paper it was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from France rates\nAnd and then she was just going to sort of place it there and leave it there and and you can see that you know for the beautiful find or you can be difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out you know paradoxes that\nAnd I think ... yeah\nThank you so much to her and my ...\nSarah Franklin the editor of the Lewis at the table with an American which\nTeaches food writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nMhm [noise]\nUm [noise] one of the Lewis is deepest friendships was with another ...
