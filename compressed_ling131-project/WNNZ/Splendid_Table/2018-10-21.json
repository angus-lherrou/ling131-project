works too well for the wealthy and the well connected I go down there every day to fight for working families representative\nWell thank you Carrie thank you to WG why for hosting us in the audience for being here\nThere's two things I'm hoping that people watching will take away from tonight and the first is that I Will be your full time senator for the next six years hall repeat that I'll be your fulltime senator for the next six years\nAnd the only thing that matters to me is what matters to the people of Massachusetts that's why I lead a repeal of the index gas tax saving taxpayers two billion dollars\nThat's why I stood up to special interest to stop the Olympics from taking ten billion dollars in a boondoggle\nIn fact I Want to stop the poisonous politics it's infected Washington DC and the obstruction that's been led by my opponent and I've spent more than a year talking with people listening to them not lecturing them\nAnd that's why I Would like to be your voice and I'm asking for your vote on November six\nThinking and representative the first question goes to you this evening\nFlooding which has traveled our reason in recent years is among the range of problems everything United Nations report that climate change is causing Canada is considering a national carbon tax it's viable option for paying for the impact that pollution which scientists say\nLeads to climate change can have on the United states\nWhere you can't deny the fact that we are feeling the effects of climate change and I think that uh in Massachusetts we've done a strong job of moving towards renewable energies we've invested in fact I voted for legislation that has increased uh our goal on wind power off the shores and at the same time we've been part of a Reggie agreement that has\nTried to make sure that there were one of the cleanest regions in the country so I think Massachusetts has been doing it very well\nThis affects though not just a inland obviously this affects coastal areas as you've been talking about with a flooding but also the fishing industry for example with warmer water is off our shores we're starting to see different species coming in and our fishermen are trying to catch\nYou know the traditional caught and other fish out there and other species of now Conan there\nUnfortunately that restricts the amount of fish that they are able to bring that go to market and uh what they need to do is be able to have more of a voice when the catch limits as well now unfortunately the fishermen in New Bedford one of our bridges ports in the United states\nHas had the sector nine ground fishing industry virtually come to a standstill because there's been\nForty federal fishing licenses that have not been transferred my opponent has been asked by this New Bedford city council four times specifically for times to enter ... seed and help with the fishing industry with no regulation so they can have a stronger voice I think that's also an important part of the discussion when it comes to the effects of climate change\nSenator Warren el remind me of the question is climbing a carbon tax a viable option to help this issue here in the United states\nSo it's clear to me that we need a way to make polluters pay for the damage they do and there are a lot of different ways we can do that one I'll just start right here locally and that has made GE pay to clean up the who's the Titanic river\nUm they originally agreed to and then once Donald Trump was elected they backed up and said well no let's renegotiate again and now they don't want to have to move the pollution that they caused out of state\nYou know this is one of the consequences though of what Mr deal wants to do as Donald Trump's campaign chair\nWhen Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord not a peep from Mr deal when a coal lobbyists was put in the head of the EPA not a peep from Mr deal\nYou want to talk about fishing one of the things that Mr deal has said is that he embraces offshore drilling I Want you to think about that and what that would mean for Massachusetts\nWe have offshore drilling off the coast of Massachusetts one spill\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nIndustry is wiped out our tourism industry on the east coast is wiped out and the way of life that we have nurtured for centuries will be gone but\nClimate change is real and it is urgent problem that we need to bear down on and we need to bear down on it now I have a bill to try to push corporations to do more on climate change it all started taking one minute for about our\nShores so a much like\nThe center who mistakenly thought that I was at a police rally there was some sort of tied to some racist rally or she's also mistaken on saying that I support offshore drilling in fact I was on W. GBH radio\nOr several months ago with Jim and Marjory talking specifically on record as saying I'm against anything that's going to affect our fishermen and the wind turbine placements that we're trying to get done to create more energy here in Massachusetts\nUm the other thing too are affecting the environment that's really bad and I think we need to make sure we focus on is the ... that have been a found on military bases right out here west field or the other thing too is that is also found on turnout gear for firefighters causing a health risks for them including cancer and I think uh companies like\nDupont who are manufacturing it had been responsible for the if the bees should also be held responsible their accent senator one\nShow I thought that Mr deal might want to go with what he said on W. GBH to the people of Massachusetts\nBut on September twenty six twenty Seventeen when he was on southern sense radio Mr deal said quote you have to have all the options on the table and so to me offshore drilling any and all places where we can get that energy in a reasonable way is quote I Am all for it on her\nWords he goes and says one thing somewhere else I'm all for offshore drilling it comes to Massachusetts is now it's well maybe not so much because he thinks the W. GBH audience might not be quite so supportive\nYou know and he raised the point twice now about the rallies that he attended there was a rally in born organized by act for America a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center designated as a hate group\nAnd described as quote the largest anti Muslim group in America he was there on April ... April twenty second twenty Eighteen the photographs actually showed the group and at that\nSo I'm not a good bipartisan bill but I Need some allies and he's from allies down in Washington and I need them not just on a marijuana law we need them them all sorts of things I stood on the floor at the United States Senate when I watched at health care hung by uh\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThat's single vote to repeal health care for tens of millions of Americans yeah I'm trying to help people around the country in other states\nBecause I Want some allies down in Washington the best way I can protect healthcare right here in Massachusetts is to have more people in Washington who care about health care by the way that repeal of health care that Mr deal has embrace Donald Trump is embrace\nThe Republicans have embraced would cost Massachusetts more than two billion dollars every single year\nAnd repeal of the protections for people with preexisting conditions this really matters\nHeroin thank you and the next question does start when you were talking about Social Security played so there are Fifteen Years until Social Security is expected to pay eighty cents on the dollar do you see a way to fix the system to avoid those benefits being written\nSo I appreciate the question but I actually think the frame a little bit with respect to send the wrong place the Republicans just gave away a trillion and a half dollars to giant corporations and billionaires through a tax scam\nAnd now the debt has one and what if the Republicans said is the appropriate response now it's time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat the Republican plan not wait not strength and it put it on the chopping block\nSo let me just stop right here and say I will never vote to cut Social Security I Will never vote to cut Medicare these are basic programs that people have paid for it that they are entitled to\nThe idea that the Republicans are running a scam saying we're going to give billions of dollars oh wait a giant corporations that now have\nRecord tax and ... a record profits\nAnd then turn around and take it out on the backs of people who collect Social Security and rely on Medicare we don't need to cut Social Security and Medicare we need to expand it I have already introduced legislation I introduced ... years ago\nTo say we need to move forward on making Social Security stronger financially but make sure it's there for every one of our seniors after a lifetime hard work you should be entitled to that time\nThank you very much or do you see a way to fix the system so that benefits to Social Security won't be renting\nIs happening right now in fact my opponent has vowed to repeal the very mechanism that is revealing Social Security and Medicare the tax reform of two thousand Seventeen which she voted against which she has vowed to repeal\nHas now created new jobs has created increased wages that create the payroll taxes that go into refill now we as a country are starting to see in just a year the effects of this tax reform bill giving us\nFour point one GDP\nRecord unemployment fifty years since we've had unemployment at the level it's at now Massachusetts is actually beating the national number on unemployment Massachusetts has benefited greatly eighty percent of Massachusetts residents received a tax cut\nBecause of this tax reform bill but Senator Warren joined a Nancy Pelosi and calling it crumbs saying that the people were not getting what they were they were do which is finally a break from federal government\nSo we're seeing people now having more jobs are having higher wages and in Massachusetts are state revenues exceeded one point two billion dollars in an anticipated tax revenue because of all the investment companies are putting into it and by the way I Want to add\nMy wife and I own a small business we invest our life savings to start it we've had it for sixteen almost Seventeen years now and you know what\nIt's time for government to finally help us from the largest corporate rate in the world to allowing us to finally reinvest in our businesses Ninety percent of businesses and our country our twenty employees are lower their\nParents are thank you and your about us Senator Warren some people have suggested raising the retirement age to Seventy two with a solution to this one\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be mean Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north hoping you're glad rig zone or get your tickets today at NPR are done minutes\nThat it takes to meet our obligations\nBut let's be clear what the Republicans want to do it just run a scam on the American people\nAnd the scams start by cutting revenues to the federal government\nYou know the idea that somehow the federal government is getting richer check the facts on that the debt is going up and the Republicans are saying openly this isn't even a secret time to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block\nThat people what they depend on\nSo for me this one is easy this tax break was a scam from the beginning\nExxon alone one company gets more in tax breaks than Ninety five percent of all the people in the commonwealth of Massachusetts those breaks didn't go to small businesses they went to giant businesses because that's who the Republicans want government to work for\nEverything in your about all the same question and raising the retirement age to Seventy two is that something using paper\nNo it's not something we should do in fact government is taking in record revenues they'd never taken in more tax revenue than before however what's needed is sending someone to Washington that's going to also do the tougher part of cutting spending now\nOn begin hill I took on special interest to repeal the index gas tax when I knew that we were wasting\nBillions of dollars of taxpayer money it wasn't going where it was supposed to fifty percent of the gas tax at the time was going to the MBTA which had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance their pension fund was upside down they were asking us to fact fill it over and over again one year we found out a year later the twenty five million dollars had been stolen\nBy a fund manager that worked for the MBTA pension fund and went to work for another company\nOr to take that money so look government has the revenue and you just have the fiscal discipline to try to make sure it's been where it's supposed to go that's why you need to send someone who is willing to stand up to things like the Olympics center to warn her rating on cutting spending zero\nHave to leave it there thank you and the next question does go to your representative President Trump who you've said he was deported had called people named he called them horse race on Twitter he's called them flakes he he used ethnic slurs doesn't name calling and personal attacks that are coming in Washington these days\nLater the fact of governing in your opinion and if elected what do you do anything to combat these types of attacks\nYou know carry it is disappointed to see how Washington dysfunction you know I certainly don't\nFollow the same path that the president does on how I legislate\nOr how I deal with people but at the same time my opponent has made comments that are pretty disturbing as well she said that anybody who voted for the president was part of an ugly stew of racist okay\nShe said that when Republicans wanted to try to fix health care that we wanted blood money from the American people she's you know called to abolish ice and you know what when you have rhetoric that undercuts law enforcement you wind up having people like a Cambridge supporter of hers who put a five hundred dollar bounty if somebody would shoot\nSomebody from ice okay that's how low things have gotten I Want to be a different voice I have not\nEnact acted like that up on ... I certainly won't follow the path of Senator Warren on trying to villain I didn't hit us together that's not what our country needs right now\nAnd I want to make sure that when I go down to Washington we followed by example on that now at the same time if you look at the president and his track record I Will say that we're finally seeing economic benefits from him being in office we're seeing international benefits you know a year ago we had North Korea threatening our allies with nuclear weapons\nAnd now a year later we're seeing them having repeated meetings with South Korea even thinking about doing the Olympics with them which I also don't think is a financially good idea\nThanking Senator Warren for your part you often criticized President Trump and his name calling yeah your campaign sent out an email in may titled quote Mick Mulvaney the mosquito and that went on to say calling members of the president's staff quoting here blood suckers and henchmen\nHow do you justify calling President Trump out for his name calling but then using language like that\nOkay so what we call them in this case\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be mean Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north helping your blood red zone or get your tickets today at NPR are done minutes\nIs hateful in us against groups against how it is that you pick the most vulnerable and really go after them and you know I understand my opponent stands here he sounds reasonable he says this is not how he wants to have\nBut just look at his own record and who he's been supporting\nShe toward the border with the leader of a group that associates with white supremacists and wants to return this country to a time when quote gays were in the closet and blames juice for nine eleven he attended a rally organized by the largest anti Muslim hate group\nHe supported naming black lives matter as a hate group he defended Trump's racist attacks against a Latino federal judge look he stayed on his Trump's campaign chairman even after the Access Hollywood tapes came out\nHe got the endorsement of vice president Pence who spearheaded legislation to permit discrimination against eh LGBTQ people\nThat's ultimately what this is about this is about ugly slurs and who's going to support that kind of ugliness that turns Americans against Americans that turns people against people that says if there's a problem in your life it's their fault\nI have to interrupt the candidates\nHow can you buy it for my employment record on line and yeah alternately I took a DNA test because I Am an open book and it's all out there it's on the Internet anybody can take a look because at the end of the day\nThis isn't about me this is about what's happening to working families all across the commonwealth look I'm not somebody who ever ran for office before but I'll tell you why Iran [noise] I\nI'm a kid they wanted to be a public school teacher\nAnd by the time I graduated from high school we didn't have the money for college application much less a chance for me to actually go to college\nA lot of twists and turns in my story but my big chance with a commuter college that cost fifty dollars a semester and it opened a million doors for me I Am the daughter of someone who ended up as a janitor and I got to be a professor at the United states senator\nThose opportunities are disappearing for other kids I'm In this fight for them\nOr have you done it I'll give you a chance for an extra money if you'd like it I Know you said that you were finished with that issue\nWell looks she's actually talked about her background I think people should know that I didn't get into politics until I was forty years old I felt it was a calling it was not a career my wife and I own a small business I was on the Finance Committee in my town but I felt like the system on beacon wasn't working for the people in my district that ultimately was elected to represent\nNow I've actually cut taxes since I've been in office because that was one of the things I felt was important to give people a chance\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in a pep university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writer and roll and go for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nThese people's taxes and by the way there's only one millionaire with a mansion in this room right now up here and that is Senator Warren\nWho by the way falsified her tax returns calling them and treat ... when she took a fifty thousand dollar deduction for clothing fifty thousand dollars I don't even have that type of clothing in my house with a wife and two daughters are but that was the entry she put it in to reduce her own taxes so it is about\nA system that may be rigged unfortunately we have a senator who seems to\nMe that they're in one minute for a\nBottle so you know Mr deal says he's not a millionaire but here's the truth is actually no way of actually knowing that\nBecause his taxes are are not on line he hasn't revealed and he keeps it all secret yeah he's filled out the disclosures disclosures with huge rages see really just don't know what's going on in fact Mr deal has revealed exactly the same number of tax returns that Donald Trump pass\nAnd that's the rope but look for me what this is really about it or are we going to be transparent about who we work for I put everything out on the Internet and\nYou're right there is a mistake on my taxes it made no difference in how much I owed there is an entry here and there may be some other mistakes in it\nBut it put it out there for people to see because I don't want this fight to be about me I Want this fight to be about the next kid who needs a chance to go to school I Want it to be about the kids who need health care I Want it to be about people who are about to retire in that time what should matter\nTo our next question about commuter rail service commuter rail service from western Massachusetts nice or to Boston and seen by many hairs and assess any what if anything do you think that Congress should you take care of money for the potential project\nOh so this is one of my priorities I'm so glad you asked about this\nAnd that is to make the investments in infrastructure so that we can get high speed rail from Boston to west or to Springfield and by the way if we're doing infrastructure investment we also need to make sure that we're investing in communications\nUh so that all of the Berkshires is covered on communications you can't be part of the twenty first century economy with out that but here's the problem again\nThe Republicans have given away a trillion and a half\nDollars to the most profitable corporations to billionaires and so when they talk about oh yeah they've got some infrastructure plan\nTurns out it's not real it's all smoke and mirrors it's all about oh well let's see the federal government will put up one dollar it's localities can put up four dollars and\nHow well the federal government even put up that one dollar well actually the way it's going to work is they're going to keep the money that otherwise had been going just cities right here like Springfield [noise]\nYou know we just can't keep doing this this is this fundamental question who do you think government should work for the Republicans Donald Trump Mr deal says make it work\nAnd better for a center and center slice at the top instead of making the investments in infrastructure that we need right here in western Massachusetts in education in building a future for every\nAnd that time what if anything do you think should be done at this level to secure a real funding east to west\nKnow Senator Warren I talked before this started about how we both were in traffic to get here for the debate\nAnd I can feel the pain because I've been out there on my campaign RV\nOr driving around the state for over a year talking to people and when we're driving from let's say agawam up to a Pittsfield sometimes you lose your wife I sometimes you lose your cell phone connection we do need communications infrastructure because communications infrastructure will allow central and western Massachusetts\nTo bring some of the businesses that are currently overcrowding eastern Massachusetts is great that the seaport in Boston has\nGE and has med tech in these companies that are coming in and building you know new headquarters in Boston is wonderful but there's a lot of people who need those opportunities those jobs and\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in a path university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writing and roll and go for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nThe businesses to come out here as far as rail I totally agree now obviously the first thing you have to think about is the fact that we're currently having a tough time affording the rail system we have so maybe we look at\nPrivate partnerships to get real back out here that's how this country and the state first started private industry I Know Senator Warren says that you didn't build that when she first ran for office she said it was government roads will have to tell you it was the machine shops in Springfield in Holyoke it was the shoe factories in Brockton it was the\nFishing industry of last year New Bedford that's with built the private schools and private hospitals that first to care people provided the money to build those roads we need to make sure businesses are given a chance to grow as well so we can have those funds to build the\nRanking even senator one minute\nSo this is the standard Republican playbook city are all in favor of infrastructure somehow the public sector doesn't really have to put up the money the private sector is going to do it and guess what the infrastructure never gets built and that's exactly\nWhere we find ourselves in western Massachusetts how many times have politicians like Mr deal stood up and said over and over yeah we need that high speed rail and totally in favor of that high speed rail\nBut when it comes down to it won't vote to be to put the funds in so that you can actually build the high speed rail look we ought to be putting real money in at the federal government level and we could do that\nExcept for the fact that the Republicans Mr deal Donald Trump have given away a trillion and a half dollars\nTo billionaires and giant corporations it's the ultimate question of who government works for it shouldn't be working just for the rich and the powerful infrastructure is how we build a future for all of us are present at one minute\nSure we'll look I Know about infrastructure when we did the gas tax ballot question in two thousand fourteen we knew exactly where a lot of money was going and where should have been going in we're too much money was going in fact in Massachusetts where number two to New Jersey for what we spend to maintain our roads\nAnd so when we want to build rail we need to have the money available and not wasted in other areas Massachusetts spends six hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nPer mile per year to maintain our roads now the national average is a hundred and forty five thousand dollars per mile per year\nAll right that's New Hampshire they pay the national average their roads are in pretty good shape Massachusetts could be spending their money more efficiently that would uh leave us the money to put it where we need it whether it's going to be improving the rail system that we have\nThat had six billion dollars of deferred maintenance over the last decade or whether it's making sure that we can try new lines to get more service to get more people to and from job locations that are going to help grow the economy and pay the taxes that build the rail\nYou and the right answer the next question\nHint that data tells us that the Hispanic population in western Massachusetts is growing\nAnd according to the Pew Research center the number of Hispanics eligible to vote has steadily grown yet they're voting in mid term elections has declined since two thousand and according to peel [noise] have you taken steps to reach out to minority voters while you've been campaigning\nWell sure I mean of course when you're going out or talking to people on the campaign trail you attend parades you go door to door you go to different communities of course I've been to a Lawrence I've talked to a lot of people there during their festivals I've been to New Bedford a marching in their parades talking to the\nResidents there are people of all races it's not to me are campaigning about trying to reach just one segment but I Will say you know as far as the Hispanic community and not voting that's not good to hear and perhaps they're feeling the same thing a lot of people are feeling disgust\nWith the people that are currently elected disgusted with Washington and the way it's functioning maybe distrust would be can Helen how they don't seem to be looking after the interest of the people we have more and more ballot questions\nGoing on every year instead of legislators actually doing their job we have to decide nursing levels we have to decide marijuana laws you know ... casinos had to be put in the hands of the people why aren't lawmakers doing what they're supposed to be doing so if any one segment of our state\nIs not happy with politicians and politics I get it uh but uh hopefully you know in this case\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual Joe's baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first to
