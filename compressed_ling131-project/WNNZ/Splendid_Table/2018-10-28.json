this restaurant secret weapon home\nHi Michael thanks so much for talking with us I don't think driving me see I could tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came to that\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kind of snowball into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the best malt vinegar I've ever had in my life\nSo definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's a absurd obsession\n[laughter] now your book reveals vinegar I could be so much more of our son the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier is not justice overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make a big red either two to one or three to one ratio oil to vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances and aroma individual gr by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process sees it de glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines uh it it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that is actually about the balance in harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned baking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano or certainly is kind of like what Irish soda bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organized part of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example vinegars that are unique to certain places and how they're ...\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar in them have some kind of the city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient and moving Italy I just got back from a trip or in a meal you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball semi vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not world until like the Nineteen seventies\nA such a small amount is me that a lot of people having to be an experienced it so seeing that vinegar and contacts and seeing that his barely used as an application where you heat it up\nYou know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegar from single ingredient a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking barren out solution\nAnd makes these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced you know ... ... Khan writes vinegar the things you buy an supermarkets but when you taste a\nReal race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and race vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of race they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nTo sue this red vinegar made from the age ...\nAnd it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe as soon as the more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell vinegar as nothing more than four to six percent the seating acid and solution and that solution is\nWater so kind of like wind there are all these volatile s jerseys aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're in calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is often a sensation before it's a flavor\nAnd it's delicious and then we've also been making ... caught a a cool a desert to lead is actually a thing we haven't gotten to the desert chapter yet but we have plans to make crumble lay putting built all ha very excited to start testing that\nOh awesome and there are a lot of these leaders now out on the market you guys have done the tests of the best ones right\nThat's right our teeth thing and testing team has dove into all of us regulators that are currently out there and there are a ton of options for the home cook and they actually picked a winner which is called the jewel circular leader\nAnd it's small and it's sleek and it is incredibly accurate it's really wonderful about how much is the jewel so the jewels around two hundred dollars and this is much cheaper than the first generation I'm CB devices needs to be they used to be a lot thicker a lot\nSlower and now they're very light to very easy very fast and they work very well they're also connected to why fight and Bluetooth so the jewel works via an app on your smartphone which is pretty convenient\nThey used to be like a thousand bucks for a few hundred way way cheaper now too so I guess it's hard to start speculating like so much for that\n[laughter] and thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen you can find those who viewed recipe for

about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend filed challenge beautiful liquor that right there and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my my friend got me well I think a little ... the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the Fraser and ... they make\nSomething with them a problem with I don't know what to make with them I experimented a little bit I made chicken legs look right there I made some vacation like oh God that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use them more and show off you know I guess\nOr is there you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal cast iron brains are about what size\n[noise] um I Would say probably eat our toilets fourteen inches pretty large\nOh big you know we've got a big oh yeah oh cool and then you have some cats aren't cook cuts which was like the basically the little mini ranges right and how big are those are the kind of similar in shape to her and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal English so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that and like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake\nThey're just so beautiful that when you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but you're twelve or fourteen inch praise or not they were talking because of that is a really fun to be the appointment to have [noise] I think for that\nI Want to talk to you about in general I think that kind of pot does really well\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nAn animal brazen when you say as a a cast iron so it holds heat really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that\nIs that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and the what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see here the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like hardier cut of meat\nAnd then what's great is you can get that thing hot but those are like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal am lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a\nMore intense or like a ... year is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan holds that heat so well\nAnd it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut just really get that year and nice in deep into the cuts does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that make it what kind of stealing or anything or no longer not smart see things more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome them though is once you get that really nice dark seer\nThem what you do you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that hadn't burnt so then you continue to use that to brave like you say in this do and that's when you add your liquid you can add you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven and I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off just server right in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt gets on those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave me this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter]\nYeah it was it was perfect for both of us like\nSurfing will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's ... you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not 'cause they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make ... noodles and he wants to learn how to cook was ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more out and say I'm I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is\nCooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he\nBecause what happens is when you have ... you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still some Kenny and zucchini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen and it's you know the stuff on the surface of the hands of cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest as divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they soften up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can eat cooked [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients and let us know what are the things that you use that you know and we might
