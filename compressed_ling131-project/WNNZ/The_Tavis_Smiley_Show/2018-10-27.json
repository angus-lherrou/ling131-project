proposal to limit how many patients can be assigned to each registered nurse in hospitals and certain other health care facilities\nWB or is Martha Bebinger spoke to nurses about how they feel about this question friend opinion on the staff nurse at Mass General hospital does not support the question\nWhy isn't the focus more on what they can do to help change that situation first in making everybody follow that same cookie cutter solution when when we don't need that\nBut you just shouldn't do Rothschild an associate professor of nursing at Boston College does support the question\nI mean there's an effort of expiration so here we are\nTrying to make sure that there is equitable care\nOur entire system because there are wide wide disparities\nDebbie Burke chief nurse at Mass General tells Martha she was disappointed that this decision is coming down to a valid question\nIt saddens me that this is on the ballot is it on the ballot because there are some organizations that haven't listened to nurses so I think it's sad that it's come to this and that we're going to ask the general public what they think about how we should staff\nWB or took a poll in late September they found voters were divided forty four to forty four percent against that our staffing ballot with twelve percent still undecided\nNow in Maine ballot question one also deals with health care it would

issues like paid family medical leave funding for public schools and equal housing opportunities all issue she's personally dealt with\nI Want to be the voice of young people because sadly the New Hampshire is aging and we don't have enough of young people so that I Want to show that younger people has a voice to do things and the New Hampshire\nWith four hundred state rep seats it seemed like there are a lot of opportunities for young people like with a year to get involved but that's not the case\nIn New Hampshire we like to say we have a citizen legislature and we do but it's a very select citizen legislature when you only get paid a hundred dollars the server two hundred dollars a term to serve\n... he's the president of the New Hampshire young Democrats he says it's a challenge to get people with young families or less flexible job to run because of the time commitment they have to make and how little they get paid\nBut this election year both parties are trying to overcome those obstacles and get folks under the age of forty in the legislature Democrats are feeling fifty two of those candidates and Republicans forty seven\nIt was it was tough to be a young

if you had that experience back in Nineteen eighty um I think the outlooks different I think we know\nThat we have student loan debt that nobody else can really compared to um I Know I have about eighty thousand dollars in student loan debt after my undergrad and my master's degree but I just think at the end of the day that representation matters\nOne candidate Sweeney hopes gets a chance this November is Virginia dry she's the youngest candidate running for office in New Hampshire I'm Nineteen and Republican and a woman and I want to represent that and hunger strike graduated from high school last\nYear now she's working part time job and she'll start on line classes in January she's running for house seat and Sullivan district one which is one of the most solidly democratic district in the states\nBut dry stain optimistic that if she puts in the work it might be possible to win and complete the plan she laid out for herself when she was just twelve that summer she went to camp learned about writing bills and what it takes to get those to pass through the legislature\nAnd I fell in love with the process the formality of the political of parliamentary procedure and that's why I decided as like I can do this in real life\nSo after doing some asked she decided the earliest she could pass bills in real life would be Nineteen\nBut the fact that Dr staying in New Hampshire makes her a bit unusual among her friends a number have gone out of state for college what they want to do is just not in the state keeping young people in New Hampshire has been a central concern among business leaders politicians schools and community leaders\nIt's a big issue to tackle drag knowledge is but she says instead of just focusing on getting younger people to

misadventures in means Baxter said park she's also the author of death on Mount Washington\nShe wanted to say about the dangers of hiking in New England and told us what to do to stay safe Randy welcome to next thanks for having me now your book death on on the till the events leading up to many of the sixty four deaths that have been recorded\nThere since Nineteen thirty three in the park maybe you'd start by telling us the story one of the stories that stands out to you the most about the people who perished while hiking there\nWell you know there's a story about four young men who went up the mountain together who were climbing or they started out on a warm fall day and suddenly it turned into a tremendous blizzard the kind a blizzard that he's the one thing maybe Twenty years\nWhen temperatures fell into beyond the single digits down into the negative digits and these poor guys were stuck on the side of the mountain on a ledge all night in this crazy weather and remarkably most of them got out only one of them died\nHe just you know sadly hypothermia got him\nThe others and manage to find their way out at the end of the scariest thing was no one was looking for them\nBecause people assumed that they had made it back or that they were camping somewhere on the mountain and that they were All right so no one was that there was no no wonderful main search and rescue team out looking for them and they staggered back pounded on the rangers door and that's how they got out alive\nA lot of the stories though do deal with the the rescue operations the very difficult situations that people have to put themselves in in order to to help people who have been stuck on the mountain and you write about the death of ranger Ralph ... this was some time ago but this is a this is an important story\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MSA in creative non fiction writing and rolling no for August twenty seven applications at bay pest dot edu\nPerson loses their life trying to save somebody else's\nRalph have happened to be the ranger on duty a chimney pond when the woman hiking with Margaret ... who was stuck on the mountain\nHelen mower came back and told the ranger that she's stuck on the mountain she can't can't get down she tried taking a short cut and there are no short cuts down from ... you really have to stay on the trail\nSo the ranger couldn't sleep knowing that there was somebody stuck up there and the weather had changed this is the Kurt up there that the weather can change on a dime\nAnd ah he went up looking for her and she found her and actually made or as comfortable as he could but then he himself that stuck on the mountain and died of hypothermia and sadly so did Margaret effect\nIn these stories are important because every time someone goes out\nHiking may be ill equipped maybe during a time when the weather is changeable there is that real possibility that a a search and rescue operation could turn deadly for the people who who are conducting that search that's a really important message to get across\nThat absolutely is and I hope that in these folks I Am getting mad at cross that these people risk their lives to bring somebody else out of the wilderness in some cases you know someone has an accident but some people do go out into the wilderness now paying attention to weather reports\nNot being well equipped and you know these people go out and risk their lives and every once in a while one of them doesn't make it back\nAnd it's it's a heartbreaking situation when that happened\nMaybe you can talk broadly about how hiking in New England might be different than in national parks elsewhere in the country because we don't have the highest peaks necessarily we don't have the hottest temperatures but we do have some very specific climate conditions here what's different between New England parks and and the rest of the country\nWell you know as you say people people come to New England to hike expecting a milder experience and they're going to find\nA on angels landing in Zion national park or out and mount Rainier or or one one of those with a fourteen thousand foot mountain they think it's going to be easier and you know it is and\nOne of the big things is that you've got this weather coming down from the north across the ocean from the east sometimes up from the south all at the same time and that can create storm system that they just don't see out west\nSo we have different kinds of hazards up here and people need to really be prepared for what they're going to find even though they're hike is only going to take them five or six thousand feet up\nThe stories of people who die in terrible circumstances like this obviously capture the imagination can you give us some sort of context though about\nYou know what sixty some deaths over the course of you know nearly a hundred years on Mount ... means given the thousands and thousands of people who I get every year I mean what's the percentage of people who really get in trouble\nYou know the percentage is so small it's almost not worth trying to compute generally it's less than one percent a year\nAnd when you look at it on ... and a hundred thousand people go to ... state park every year and maybe one and maybe not any there will not come out just five\n... or maybe you could just leave us than with a a bit of a checklist what some advice you give to individuals who might set off on a hike of mount ... Washington especially this time of year in the fall when you might think it's beautiful to get up to the top of a mountain and see all the all the foliage what are some things you might ask people to to think about before they go", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Tavis Smiley Show", "city": "Westfield", "day": "27"}
