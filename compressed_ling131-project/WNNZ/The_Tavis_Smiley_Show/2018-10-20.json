B. U. R.\nHigh there Bruce hey greetings John So any let's start with you in with the Republican governor of New Hampshire Christian who who's up for reelection what his his record being on issues of climate change and environment\nChristian and it's taken a pretty hands off approach when it comes to climate in his first two years as our governor he often will say it's more of a federal issue than a state one he has set in the past that he's not sure about\nSome of the scientific conclusions that are broadly accepted about the role of carbon emissions and climate change for example this is actually I'm taking a bit of a step back\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nCivil engineer he used to run a ski resort so he has tons of firsthand experience with this issue and he has played that up in the past but in the state house she has taken more of a step back and\nTaking a wait and see approach and and left it to the federal government what about his Democratic challenger Molly Kelly Kelly really took the Democratic party line when it comes to climate change she often will bring it up the same way that Senate desperate they liked to sort of say the word but we don't really hear a ton of specifics from either of them\nHere some tape of Mali Kelly answering a question about natural gas formed during the primary campaign\nClimate change touching Israel we honor that\nA policy we follow it on our I have to be on\nShe'll be on that we don't hear a ton of specific from Kelly she says we need to wean off fossil fuels increase rental development she has a few ideas for how to enact stat but again doesn't go into a ton of detail for how to fund our scale ups that development\nLet's go to Massachusetts and talk about the Republican governor there Charlie Baker how is his record been on environmental issues in climate change\nWell according to the environment to legal Massachusetts in half a dozen other environmental organizations around the state who give him a great every every year the latest grade has been a sea and he's been see all through his term of office so far and he gets a a couple of as he gets a nineties for seniors\nFive ... and forays on twenty seven different issues\nSo that's a pretty wide range but I Would guess that he grades a little bit better than a lot of Republican governors around the country he's a Massachusetts Republican after all you know that's the great is probably something that's about what you can expect to tell me about that about about his place within the Republican Party\nWell he's an anomaly as you say he uh he wrote a letter to the department of energy when Trump wanted to drill offshore for gas and oil\nAnd he wrote a very stern letter to the head of the department of energy is saying no way Jose\nMassachusetts is at the end of the energy roads so we have to import most of the energy that we convert into electricity and heat\nSo you know he's cognizant of that he's been pushing big time into offshore wind\nYou know but he takes a very regional approach to energy because we are\nKind of land locked in since without offshore wind we're landlocked from our energy supplies so he has to look north south and east and west so he's taken a a very practical pragmatic but not a very ambitious cutting edge I didn't think this is the ... mental ... organizations here say you know he's okay he needs to be a lot older well\nWhat about his Democratic opponent in the gubernatorial race ... where does he stand and some of these issues\nSays more progressive if that's the term to use in in in in joining with environmental as soon and and people who believe in say and scientists to a surgeon that we are entering a cataclysmic climate future\nOr so he took some very much a much more aggressive kind of approach she wants to triple the renewable portfolio standards that we have he wants to achieve fifty percent of renewable energy but twenty thirty\nHe has a you know offshore wind he's doubling down but in that sense he's he's going along with the governor who is proposing another sixteen hundred megawatts he wants to eliminate\nConstraints on solar energy their net metering caps and so on he wants to require that old buildings where it's possible to have solar\nHindi definitely opposes the expansion of natural gas pipeline infrastructure not surprisingly he wants to make Massachusetts the first state in the nation to adapt carbon price you know basically a carbon tax on or fewer imports muscle fewer imports that contain carbon\nOf course the candidates are on the campaign trail are only going to talk about these issues in as much as the potential voters really wants them to or care about themselves but it's actually here from Elizabeth Henry she's president of the environmental league of Massachusetts talking a little bit about what Massachusetts voters are thinking about this election season\nThey're thinking about the economy I think ... and I think about health care but

context in which to point two million votes cast in the last gubernatorial election here in Massachusetts and bigger one by just forty thousand votes so you could say that's a lot but you know in terms of that list of going down in what's the importance of the electorate here in Massachusetts\nIt's issue number five maybe six on their list so what are people who voted on\nAny how 'bout you what are you hearing an in New Hampshire are people concerned about the environment this time around how much do you think people are are paying attention to this issue with all the other things they have to worry about at the polls\nYou know interestingly we don't really even have as much polling data and this is Massachusetts does we have some periodic voter surveys that come up from the
