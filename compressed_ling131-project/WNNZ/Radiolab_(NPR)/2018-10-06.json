Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet said basically that has a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nAnd the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting and the state of Florida and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was there a chase [noise]\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those ... than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and\nBuild a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database to Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at will often link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found it initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking the gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting\nAnd in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mental Ito was apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nIsn't view of the police standing

me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting that is right this is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was news to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a data out of whack with uh the Florida a\nDemographics me what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and it's that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very ... percent six kind of ... he says one ... year it's just like ... yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start\nThis nasty national still just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know I mean they're all written in this ah plumbing investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this as the Cato Daryl and police big Fowler approached department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nIt was a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a

streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nThis is something you do see in bed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a
