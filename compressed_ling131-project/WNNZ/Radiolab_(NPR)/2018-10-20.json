about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't do things that we have to say I hope we don't but we ask you and so that tension exists throughout the show so\nAnd you hear on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping something we monitor what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with that you may want to mention went on it yeah anyway the story comes to us from producers Simon at work\nSo let's start can we start in two thousand eight to her about what

[noise]\nStephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken of themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would up all of those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin

they wanted Facebook to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that the small\nPeaceful protest will turn out to be joining us face off on face on\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered a hornet's nest in what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEO but today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut rather something that I think is a

of me\nOn the Internet\nMr not come back I got to\nYou some jak differently prioritize or sensors speech\nCongresswoman we don't ... the global for doing of censoring speech but there are types of ...\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documents about fifty pages if you print it off and diet\nIn bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe\nWhich made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\nIn the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees one on one of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time when\nI joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in nearly two\nThousand seismic change this week and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path nice spaced out is now the most visited website in the U.S [noise]\nThey still had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things that come up onto their screen flag day to Facebook and I'm like meaning like I use or something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nCake clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag apiece\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nPeople sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were seeing was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad\nHoc approach was there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ... and basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until [laughter]\nRise fight for the rights that Brett [noise]\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with alive protest they just jump typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nAnd then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding

started pouring in the face to\nOf the idea of a single set of rules that work that can be applied fairly that's just a crazy crazy concepts\nBecause they've gone from something like Seventy million users to to point to the\nCampaign would say it's about eighty floors and\nThey've gone for twelve folks sitting in a room deciding what to take down or leave up to somewhere around sixteen thousand

them there to try to talk to some of these people to for a living sit at a computer and collectively click through around a million flag bits of content to pop up on the screen every day wow what we ... I'm just curious like what's what's that like\nWell I'm\nOf what we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting even mean happening\nAnd I certainly did you get to work [laughter] so now I don't I start by these you know I'm Sorry you work in but\nI Know you're lying in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find\nWho yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I just landed history I don't want to leave I got\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to find these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to a myth that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike hijacked prohibited prohibit any ... about ... watch\nBlind there's several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be game to uh at the same time it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYou know I I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know fairly you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year could show up to his desk every morning put on its head phones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nCase by case by case by case forty five thousand tests every day it was just at lunch and ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every\nThree or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day oh\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like they all got ...

to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty

[noise]\nVoters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platform it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to their rules in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to ... says no\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nEssentially the photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received push back\nWell I was saying that what we've prided ourselves on was not making those calls and then there are no\nExceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for a moment like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nDo you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... sent down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what the reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt yes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher who would they don't see maybe they have but says made in news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech\nIs Facebook is sort of collective scrap\nBook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you\nWant or yeah it is it now and news organizations strengths parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and bill product\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic illegal island where are they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subject to defeat regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what\n... what really strikes me about all of this is is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting more important than what what people find newsworthy ... they'll give and I'll give you
