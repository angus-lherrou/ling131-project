I'm I'm Rhonda I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing but it was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what ... what's their next move wild so they decided to put the burden plea bargain take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my client\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give a moon you're going to take a ... well\nThat's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nBelgian started drinking heavily abandoned his law practice and moved to Florida or body tough it out but he suffered\nA no one wanted him as a lawyer anymore but it was like you know what else can\nI Do [noise] to make your living\nHe was just barely getting by for a little while I think probably oh look to stress and pressure you know [noise] to to to do in\nFact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and then the state bar the Belgian our money did\nWas write what they did was good exactly\nAccording to the law and my view is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so it's Meyer Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nAt least they told me about this panel she organized back in two thousand seven is for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room\nMost of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't think I was here or there was a lawyer to do the job [noise] uh I mean I was a good lawyer\nRecites a so I'd everybody\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the past university graduate schools ... enrolling for October twenty second applications a pest dot edu\nThis case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people say what if what if what if\nPeople say so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you've been in sitting in on these\nClasses and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what the lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm not with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan is the girl from Chicago She was a college student who had gone missing machines camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and don't you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn this story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is totally and comprehensible company\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes in only my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received a policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that I Need\nMy daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was from when her body my daughter's body weight\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and other western ... offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nMy father as a matter of fact I even went so far is to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing more months\nOf horror and [laughter] and that's what they taught law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't I guess\n\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of 'em that stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know that you'd want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past she Leslie I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was\nToo difficult for us\nAnd [noise] and Danny courts her boyfriend had been jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to her and he graduated just before and so to live [noise] and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future ahead of true and it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo\nHorrible to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter you know\nWe want to use it for you to protecting the person that killed her\nNew justification you
