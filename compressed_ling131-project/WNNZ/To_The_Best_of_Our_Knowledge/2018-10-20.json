those are the two oldest children they left Monticello to live as white people they don't have freedom papers and you can see why they don't want them because\nIf they had free papers people would

Madison it asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nTo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but we have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children to read and what\nWhat do we do well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery and we've

create the country\nNot just ... percent of the Washington at all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time interest and some of it was good and some of it was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut you got one mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he thought\nBlack people were inferior we're not as smart as when you found that most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I ventured is a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and creating a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be

novel the archivist talks about the difference between mystery and secrets and it seems to me that mystery and secrets or two of the major themes in both the twin peaks TV series and and your novel what do you think\nI Would agree with that I Would say that the idea of mystery is something that is\nProfoundly inherent in all of reality it's a Joseph cambell mystery as opposed to a murder mystery I it's it's a sense that there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded

one occasion and why did why doesn't want to include so much UFO content [noise]\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season of the show the writer was that was ground for it\nNumber two it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience and as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition in in human storytelling of people being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings but they have no explanation for understanding I cite\nAn example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament sees this flaming cherry it in the sky and talks of meeting these giants the L O team it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that a very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky was just ... well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you call this if you know going further back and pre the Wright brothers and things that you should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experience\nI mean in the in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they call them with encounters with the fairies or ALS or in Germany they were ... trolls are getting worms that lived in the mountains [noise] even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas worth the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also leave conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully and these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed\nWith getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became a kind of alternate way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on\nConventional or authoritative voices that there were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI I think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody is small and as insignificant and as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThan it can be random there's got to be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just as sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the world\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at

way on some kind of truth that spoke to a a lot of people\nIf you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick and cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them on the edge of their seat but\nTo go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and a culture is that it's our job\nTo keep mythology alive for people that's akin to what ... did in the first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past\nAnd that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best that's what storytellers do for our culture now\n[noise] what\nMartin Frost is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch the true

afterlife right [noise]\nRight yeah I mean ... actually meet in Tibet means transitional state so there are several Bartels I mean we're in one right now we're in the transitional stay between birth and death and so the bottom of the book sort of is the one that goes from the inside of your desk to the incident of your your next burst\nI mean in in a sense it's maybe analogous to purgatory although it's more driven by the use or you could say like the the person who goes to the bottle can get out if he or she is just willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own habituate and you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go onto the next step\nSo the danger of the ... you can get stuck there or you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably more ... than the actual Tibetan borrow but at some point that kind of had to break from it and and\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded

but my guess is that whatever happens was going to be a real shocker you know and ah [laughter] and it it is not going to be like oh this is just what we were told\nSo so that was part of the the writing challenger was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be but be different enough that we shared and some of that disorientation that an actual that person would feel\n'cause this resonate for you personally I mean it's more than just the literary device but ... the Buddhist concept of ...\nOh yeah my wife and I had been students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know total beginner but it back and flex this life\nIn a sense you if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild horses gets off the tether because now it's not dampen bite your physical body anymore\nAnd the mind in that state they say can do anything you can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell if that's the case the way we called debate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a a literal afterlife or if that doesn't suture you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell does instant by our habits of mind and then the kind of hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could Cosby the state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane and the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been hell\nAre right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion that they're they're both exercises in world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises\nYes they are you know I think in world building especially in a book like this which is ... you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to do them and what was interesting to me was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically in town dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is that you do this kind of intuitive approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd then the really magical thing was it you know a ... year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started kind of producing weird fruit you know there would be turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving\nThat weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if
