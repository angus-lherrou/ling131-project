crawling\nThey got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about\nPoisonous plants\nSocrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell those stories not to write a field guide to poison is planning\nBut to talk about wind plants have actually killed someone or been used in warfare or for some dark in various [noise]\nAny story is a mystery writer\nShe's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with a sign ...\nWriting about wicked plants\nShe introduced Shanahan retire to a few\nAbraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake rude poisonous cows would grades on this plant the poison would make them sick but also\nGet into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and\nIt was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments the KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins in\nPlant I read that you have a poisonous plant garden\nThat it's been lifted it's one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world\nBut [laughter] well I've out that I Want it to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about

hallucinogenic plant from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are losing a Jenike plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're he started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making it creepy so like rather than plant markers I had these cement tombstones identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or blindness\nI found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nI had all these lightly defective goals and hands and and so I had those are kind of Ohio like a skeleton buried does creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plant\nSo I was crying Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and its spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them\nAre very pretty I've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an ability to hate\n[laughter] I think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and that is something that we're finding out more about so one way that plants communicate is through route exits so they exude\nChemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract certain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're\nUnder attack they can release a pheromone that would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting\nTo figure out do you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nI'm sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect against predators it's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strict nine is a hundred percent plant based on what a cyanide so as a rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eaten\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why ...\n... or spines are stinging metals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nThat was Amy Stewart [noise] she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken botanist wiccan town [noise]\nAnd that was shot and

really becomes less about how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living\nIn a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... where you break this idea of present to them down into five big areas and let let's talk about those one you call ... ... what does this\nWhich is interesting and it kinda comes out of that video game sensibility I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou are the one going through the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice the choice rather than watching the canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line what we're choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of our stuff\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copies do well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox it's filling up with messages that are waiting for responses their view on Facebook who\nMight be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in these sponsored stories\nYou know so how do you deal with all of these different use running simultaneously that's\nSort of the essence of the digital ... kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're single person now have to deal with all of them I've got the idea for the digital for any a chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk with her I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I end up in this lobby\nAnd I get this message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar because they said I was trying to log in from too many places at once right so frugal calendar didn't believe I was a human being\nThey didn't believe one human could be and all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not this idea of information overload and all these people have all these problems with digital technology and this I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just\nWhining and handwringing about the problems of talented but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital timeframe you know digital technologies really don't understand time they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you it doesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited\nYou know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were also smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we sounded smarter online than we did in real life\nStreaming of New England
