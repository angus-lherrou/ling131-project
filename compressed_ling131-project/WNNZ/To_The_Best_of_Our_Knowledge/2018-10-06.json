the Nineteen\nSeventies was the era of second wave ms magazine Gloria Steinem Betty for it [noise]\nBut when a lot of people don't remember is that it also sparked the man's liberation [noise] one of its early leaders was Lawrence Carroll author of the myth of male power that look was the cortex the men's rights movement but ... says he never considered the men's\nMovement a backlash to feminism more like a continuation\nThe blessing that the women's movement gave two girls and women was basically saying to two girls but let's say there's a ... you're married and you're both men and women have a a a job and relatively decent job and the woman becomes pregnant the woman's has basically to herself I have\nThree options here option one has to be full time involved with my children option to be full time involved with my workplace options for you to do some combination of both\nThe man's is sort of sits back and he says well yeah I have three options to option one has worked fulltime option she was worked fulltime option three has worked fulltime and then if he earns a great deal of money he calls it power but power if you feel obligated to earn money that often somebody else spins while you die sooner\nI think that's a very deficient definition of power\nAnd there's been no men's movement to help boys question that paradigm\nSo what I Want to bring in the men's rights movement here and and sort of what this is a response to it because you are commonly called the father of the men's rights movement what do you see as the goal here as the value of this movement\nThe men's rights movement and it's sort of current for them is like someone who is shouting to be heard for Thirty years and has not been heard\nAnd when people shall to be heard they get hurt they get mean they distort they do anything to get attention and so many people in the men's rights movement are highly intelligent and thoughtful other people in the men's rights movement feel that that women have\nGotten a lot of opportunities that men don't have and that nobody sees the opportunities that men don't have\nAnd we should point out I mean there is a nasty side to all of this or I mean as we as as one reporter is called it you know it's an army of massage innocent trolls on the Internet\nYes well first of all it is in an army of but many of the people in the men's movement are so hurt and such pain that they're shouting out and when people don't get heard as in any relationship they start getting meaner and meaner and angrier and angrier and so if we want to do the best we can is instead of saying\nTrolls or army of let's say what are they trying to say that we are hearing when the women's movement first surfaced I remember and I was on the board of it now in New York City as you know\nI remember being in Barbara Walters showing the today show and Barbara Walters had well how can you be part of a movement is where you have people like ... who was bisexual this was a dumb ... years ago and this was considered not okay and I said Barbara\nFirst of all people who are bisexual may see the heterosexual world more clearly than we do\nWhat do we open our ears to what the women's movement is saying and instead of calling them dikes and bra burners why don't we hear their best intent and that led me to spending a good part of my life I'm supporting the women's movement and trying to articulate two men who were feeling threatened by it what the woman's movements best intent was\nShould just reiterate this point because I mean this is kind of fascinating when you who are so identified with the men's rights movement back in the seventies he worked for the national organization for women your cold but the Gloria Steinem of men\nStreaming of New England public radio

men and if we don't focus on men the second stage of the women's movement we will be in trouble but there's an underlying reason that we don't listen to to men\nAnd that is because part of what toxic

R. dot net thank you very much so I\nUsed to come on at two pm on so I was sitting in my bathroom listening to ... putting on shave butter and I got a call from the friends he asked me what I was\nDoing sitting in the past up listening to public radio footing on Shea butters and he said oh that sounds like a really interesting we're\nOkay that wouldn't be my reaction but we're talking about how artists work\nThey kind of let me thinking about how complicated material was its relationship to Africa can an African ness from West Africa ... shape and it is it's a West African interior August\nComes from I'm not too often put in a lot of different products that we use today even dragons indifference lotion on this pretty much everybody has put shaped letter on their skin they just may not realize it everybody is using a butter and they may not realize\nSo they are all in the gauging and some sort of relationship with a\nWith Africa that they may not necessarily be aware that they\nWere standing in front of one of Rashid John for his newest works in a one man show at the Milwaukee art museum\nIt's a long heavy wooden table piled with big sculptural blocks of shape butter and when you get close you can see that the table itself has been burned and places looks almost like a ritual [noise]\nIt is kind of a ritual experience I built the large forged and then I have the steel brands\nSome of them are kind of like gun sights others are just circles triangles but the steel brands going to the until the fourth and heat it almost like a cattle brand and then it burns and to the table so there's this\nGarnering the scarf occasionally the material and by placing the Shea butter on top of it and you kind of imagine beginning the healing process for this cat yeah\nSo what began as a private moment in the bath tub turned into a peaceful of historical allusions to slavery and colonial trade\nThis is what fascinates me about Rashid Johnson he's always thinking about the complicated relationship to push and pull between individual and collective identity\nThe biggest piece here is actually bonds or a room for sides of open black scaffolding spilling over the tropical plans and pork and both my folks\n... that it's worth pointing out that um\nThese are photos that you've taken all over the world and I started jotting down some of these places lake goes where he grew up a Nuremberg typically I wrote the article in Tripoli Milan Berlin's direct Copenhagen soul Bombay Sao paolo Brooklyn bay roots Bali the list\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools asset higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nTravel a lot and I I take a lot of pleasure from it I might get a lot of productive discomfort from it\nThere's a way that outside during this can help you understand what you're an insider to being a Nigerian American in America helps me jaundiced eye Nigeria in a more intense way\nSo it's easier for you to write about Nigeria when you're here in the U.S\nNo writing is easy but it it gives the Fords me a certain insight into it knowing it well looking at it from a distance being in Nigeria haven't grown up in Nigeria illuminates my understanding of American even though I'm an American\nI Want to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born in in the U. S. right in Michigan yes but then quickly your family move is in a few months to like us and you grow up there for for how long how many ... Seventeen years now and then came back to America\nAnd then I came back to the U.S back to the mid west back to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but they came to the u._s. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American who was Nigerian it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nI mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the U.S\nToo when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time you started having those XP\nOr well I you know I've been in the U.S for\nA twenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years\nThe many things I did not have a narrative for what does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan and a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me\nI had to figure out what to think about that but\nAlso what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting\nAnd somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks\nWhat does that mean you know and all of this stuff has to be understood and you know\nIt took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America but you live in Brooklyn now I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so did you consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends of air\nMy books there so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there it's where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos your by an English on languages I'm fluent in so there's an at home ness but home is also wherever there's Good Wife by\n[laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects me to the world in a way that is it reduced civil and as essential\nTo my experience of the world do you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature is a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger a lot\nI'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment\nAnd I feel invested in being an American who with other Americans thinks about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other\nWhat do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me it might monies\nStreaming of New

I'm very American in that way and I'm also very nature and in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time and are like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities well the commonalities are very\nSimilar uh it is the experience of called ... which is maybe the force definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumptions about\nThis conversations I've been talking about mhm if somebody says you know\nEngage should be and or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual all these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some right absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us in New York New York is much richer\nLagos might have twenty five buildings monumental scale and New York has three hundred and never ceases to surprise me the sheer physical scale of New York\nAnd then there's that thing in New York of being a will capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't let people in Cairo Johannesburg tell you different you know\nIt's all allies and they are dogs this is the place to go home guy talk yeah lay\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold Lagos is the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that Neal is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is it will look like if these borders are not as they are I\nLoved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city\nWhich is set in New York kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering and which is sort of I think ... some of the things that we've been talking but could you read that yes thank you but once it is a book of wondering I'm what I really wanted\nTo evoke over the course of this book was psychological intensity but also a sense of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant loud [noise]\nShock after the days focus and relative tranquility as low someone had shatters the calm most silent private chapel with a layer of a TV set [noise] I Will my way through crowds of shoppers and workers to road construction some forms of taxi cab [noise]\n\nWalking so busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nAnd I was accustomed to see the course of the day [noise]\nBeach neighborhood of the city appear to be made of a different substance\nEach seem to have a
