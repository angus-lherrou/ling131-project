a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house she remodeled it\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's coast has been here\nAnd I looked at her like she was alone [noise]\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house\nAnd this decision or a man or figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there's a man in the house and she described what she saw and the

Wilder's stories so yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff but here's the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not one is probably not an accident that I became a journalist\nAnd yet the stuff the uncanny the paranormal you read about this stuff all the time why there is some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real\nThrowing your intellect out the window you irrationality out the window where do you make of that story without just saying oh that's impossible you know there's just there's no way when it was interesting people I talked to was Michael Schober the poster boy of

stories the strange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife's from a climate Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so [noise]\n\nThey used to listen to music together many meaning to her and when he died she gets a little radio and kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\nAnyway and when she we met and fell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a\nDrawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know in the day of our wedding\nJust particular moment when she was feeling rather sad\nThat there was nobody there from her family and friends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house was like ... was that you know and I thought well I'm a slap my iPhone honor my laptop with high dunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the radio this plane is blamed his love song\nPerfectly you know perfectly tune with stations [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean it meant something to her ... her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there\nWith us and the day of our wedding and make her feel good than it did [noise] it played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and it went\nThere the next morning and the debt ever sense even though I get it to work and and civil war is still there [noise]\nTo just share my that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of ... [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... column down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit about but that also is insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this and I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of get the allergy of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you know my friend is not really religious friends with people I ... I think that there's you know sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this and it quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that it's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife had numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't come on ...\nBut this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean why something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable or there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat's possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting at the experience again and those kind of went off events don't fit that\nAnd it couldn't be they are real and we just are limited in how we can study them [noise] [noise]\n\nWell I don't think science can I ask the question of what\nThe truth about the

having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human Radio Free that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness in way or the higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage and history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have\nDifferent personalities

showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats and it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat out the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the lettering was raised and it was higher clinics and I didn't know what any of it meant to the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard\nAnd he had a Purple Rose of some kind of when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really I think that's how he presented himself for me to this all sounds kind of crazy in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences in might\nFelt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of her religious no not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostics has them I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path and things begin to happen as a result of that ... what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and\nI was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a thought comes in and rounds out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it and I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I sort of thing might surround people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things is flashes started going off so\nWhen you say seem lights around people with that was what do they look like wells\nFireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\nStuff sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was and why you for twenty five year teaching creative writing like writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own it a bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing any no I'm not ...\nI'm traveling around the world [noise] sitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them and then all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with their dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work but if you're actually having problems in your relationship\nAnd you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse to begin to look like her and possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a

hiding out I did a group in my apartment had met for Eighteen years with about ten people who would show but the most\nEvery week and we would sit in a circle guides would talk to them they would bring this energy through and we don't feel it\nWhat are the guides say when you have you've written you know multiple books now are they have through new mayor is they're sort of a common message\n[noise] yeah I think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talked about humanity being at a\nAt a transitional point that's evolution right now and the the opportunity really is here for us to reclaim what would they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man whatsoever culture you were brought up in what it means to be success what beauty is all of these things that we collectively ascribe great value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of
