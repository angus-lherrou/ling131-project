Fifteen Nineteen fifty eight on the sixtieth anniversary of morals famous wires and lights in a box speech ray Suarez and I discussed the media today\nFake so work seems to be ubiquitous today it is all over is both on the left and on the ride\nAll news seemed to be fake news no matter who is delivering them say the word implying on true deceitful maybe even farther than that treasonous our own\nNews fake news well I think we're in an age when all news is fake news to somebody and that's part of the problem that term popularized by the president\nHas become smothering wet blanket that you just throw over information you don't like\nInterpretation that you don't want to hear events that don't fit with your world view you could be discussing absolutely encounter a vertical facts facts that are very much in evidence\nAnd the president will just wave it often say fake news fake news your fake news so we're in a moment with that term a term of dismissal means I don't have to listen to you and that puts us in dangerous territory\nBut that is also because the idea of news has lost its objectivity we no longer as a people believe that the new start going to be delivered in order to inform us instead the work that you use is interpret\nWe are delivering news in order to bend that information in favor of one of the other end without interpretation there is no appeal to it somebody has to have some sort of agenda behind it\nWell look it is I think no accident that we have been pushed into this moment where\nA serious adopt a serious adult who's not necessarily in the news business just a consumer of news a serious adult person who says yes I Try to be aware of what's going on around me I I Try to be informed about the events of the day Ken simply dismiss\nAny news that's uncomfortable inconvenient or contradicts a previously held view of the world that wasn't the case before you actually were making a declaration of an seriousness if you said oh I just don't believe them\nBut now the left can say of the right there I can say it as the left the general audience is scratching its head and thinking well who is telling the truth and if they are telling me the truth or they always telling me that\nWe are such consumers of news we are hooked twenty four seven bombarded by all sorts of information coming from all sorts of sources in the act of dismissing one portion or a particular narrative or are larger agenda\nEasy manner of itself and interesting psychological stand you don't ignore it you dismiss it meaning you listen to it or you view it you process it and then you say it's fake\nAnd that is very different from not paying attention to it ... because what comes to mind here\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and a path university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay path dot edu\nAnd that society that doesn't read books has decided that banned books has chosen to put certain books out of the public eye as society that is a prophetic that doesn't want to read books might even be worse that a tyranny where the dictatorship because it is the public was making that choice\nAnd this is not something that is uniformly spread among American people we have a lot of data there's a lot of research that shows that Americans who tend to be right of center\nAlso tend to more often dismiss what comes out of the conventional news business this is a remarkable moment most of my adult life I've been trying to help the public to understand the news\nTo see stats coming out of Pew out of Gallup out of reputable research firms that say a majority of Republicans for example in one survey think that reporters make up facts\nMakeup facts and not banned in their interpretation not give a selective reporting of facts that may give you a miss impression of the some weight of a story but in fact just make things up\nTell things into a

after day after day and the idea that there is a priesthood a guild a group of people who actually their life's purpose and the way they make their living is figuring out will no in fact\nThat politician when they said that thing they weren't telling the truth that idea that you got from just seeing this thing yes the vision of it was quite effective in and moving and high impact\nBut it hit to something else that you didn't understand the fact that sets our world view is now just being washed away as everybody says look I can go out and interview people I can put things on the Web\nI can have thousands of people see the things that I discuss daily people writing blogs people doing logs people going live I look at my Facebook feed sometimes and I see somebody says\nFor so and so it's going live and I think who cares so what but we are a world now of content creators in a way that we weren't and so the doors to the priesthood have been thrown open and everybody can get in on the action\nThat there is a landscape that I Would like to add to all this in settings a landscape that comes from the larger philosophical questions that have shaken out as a civilization and I'm here not only talking about the United states but about western civilization maybe the world at large\nSince the end of the second World War and maybe even before that so the creeping relevance of relapse activists in life in general we used to believe that there was one truth\nSacred indivisible abstract ongoing it turned out that truth was universal meaning everybody was at one point or another in ... to it we have existed for fifty to a hundred years now\nIn the world of multiples truths competing with one another any truth one has\nA certain appeal in value to group ... well that is because truth be will have an equal appeal to another group a group that may be competing with number one\nIn in a world where there is no ... in a world where there is respect in democratic openness and the conviction that we all carry within ourselves a grain of truth that will not be put down by others\nThat that comes from the family that that comes from the tribe that we are a result of\nThat that universe of pull the value also spills over to the news and you don't have it from one source because the truth that is going to be deliberate in that source is very different to the other one in the U.S the questioning of the media in general as fake\nWorld War two ushered in\nA world where there were good guys and bad guys and it was not just questionable but almost unpatriotic to try to see the gray areas in there the blackouts for the black cats the White House or the white hats the world was legible in that way\nThe Cold War ushered in a time where with a country started to do some things that were not altogether admirable but still told itself it had admirable goals so it was sometimes mirroring the behavior of its existential enemies in order to achieve\nA good outcome so yeah we um\nFermented coups in countries that we're trying to establish democracies we didn't like who the democracies we're electing but we were pro democracy [laughter] so we overthrew

blemishes on the white hats and an age of questioning whether these binary truths whereas in meat as that\nWhen we found out that the government had been lying to us throughout the Vietnam War about the state of that war when we found that Richard Nixon had been lying to us about how he became president\nIt confirms that not everything that you saw and not everything that the good guys held to be the truth was really the truth some of the good guys had bad habits and bad aspects and some of the bad guys accomplish things that you thought ... can\nI admire the accomplishment without admiring the bad guy\nThe world started to a jumble up in a way that was very hard to follow and very hard to catalog in the news business and turn around and say to the people yes we are going to confirm your world of good guys and bad guys\nAt least in those days there were some relationship to what was really happening for real now you choose aside\nAnd you stick with the side no matter who the good guy is no matter whether the good guys doing bad things it is a world that's basically just been thrown up in the air like confetti and its landing on the table however it lands and the only way you make sense of it is by sticking to your guy\nIt has to take me a long time but if I asked myself why I'm here on this earth is I think that it is to think out loud to think in public\nBut thinking out loud to me is sinking a particular point of view from many perspectives in reaching the core of it being critical\nI Am frightened by how's the word critical\nHas eat cells become a casualty of this war is when you are critical you're automatically from the other side\nTrying to bring down the opponent but being critical in my ... mind is being able to ads aspects to one single argument that will enable us to see what needs to better side of that argument or that argument is built on sand\nIn my biggest fear is that in this overwhelming media that we have word ... in superficial reality rain in where the abundance numb the mind\nSet we have lost the capacity to discriminate by which I mean to be able to know what matters and what doesn't matter and to be able to think with the media and not to be in the fence when we're receiving suffering from the media\nBoy are we looking guys that we have\nGotten to physicians where people actually would be interested in listening to what we have to say for a couple of minutes but also that we get to think out loud for a living it's a great privilege to help the public and work with the public to understand a very complicated world\nBut the pressure for simplicity is on yielding\nAnd especially as the world gets more and more complex\nThe idea that when you say to people hey there's more to this then you realize\nThey don't wanna hear it they don't want to hear it because\nIt's simple will during world and I get that I Walk out of the newsroom and become John cue citizen again\nI live in the world immersed up to my jaw and the world is not

lowest that they've been in Twenty years what\nWe do about it how we argue about what's best going forward how we make some rules that actually can be followed we can't have those arguments because such large portions of the country are convinced\nOf such entirely different things I've never been as pessimistic about our ability to solve our problems\nI'm not a pessimist about America in general but I've never been as a pessimistic as I Am at the moment about our ability to solve our problems like two hundred and fifty million adults which is what we are we've got to decide a lot of important

salad bowl\nThis inability to have a good productive fight that actually leads to some sort of conclusion that leads to some sort of shared goal has got us speculating about a post us world in a way that is\nDisturbing to me and yet I see more people writing about it more people talking about it more people speculating about it than ever before in my adult lifetime the old idea was that whatever our differences were\nWe were sort of at the end of the day stuck with each other as one writer put it want America after off where there are people who have very different conclusions about the shape of the world from my own but we share enough\nThat we can stay in contact with each other we can stay in contact and conversation with each other\nBut now many more of those people are rejecting might claim to be part of the civic coal especially on social media where you can be anonymous\nPeople say horrifying things to me about whether I Belong in this country whether the family that brought me

believe\nThat they are no longer part of the same thing as I Am the\nProblem as you are putting it is that we we live in the nation I doubting\nThat does that our our fellow citizens\nAre as essential

think that it is probably the most dangerous part in you and I have been talking about the media\nAs having dangers edges precisely because it is so easy to undermine the values and the principles of

reporter\nTo talk to them in a way that was sympathetic but also elicit information from them and not be thought of do it\nIs in some levels one of the worst aspects of what the news business has come to be as emotion has\nTotally in a suit nominee crashed like a wave over the more who what when where and why how parts of what we exist as an institution to do\nEmotion has become a really big part of the story telling to get somebody to cry on air to get somebody to look as stricken as they are\nOne time after someone from the Chicago area was killed somewhere else by a murder or they were on

said oh you what do you expect me to say\n[noise] and at that moment I felt like such a huge deal because really what was there for there was nothing that I could tell the audience in Chicago that
