that way it just goes places\nAnd my story got dropped down in the order\nAnd then got dropped down from a full story to just a little bit of video and an anchor read because we got video from an interview between Roseanne Barr and David Letterman on that night's Letterman show which is course taped earlier in the day\nAnd I screamed at the produce this is\nThe worst kind of trivial as Asian people have on the evening news a half an hour to find out everything that happened in the world that day that should shape their understanding of what's important about the world here's a story that was happening just a few miles away\nAnd instead we were using and entertainment interview between a star who wasn't even on our network [laughter] and our late night talk show host as a way of using the news as a vehicle for promotion for an entertainment program\nSo this good story wasn't being told in favor of this other story\nHow righteous how idealistic how naive I was you know it went ahead and that happened and we had a drag out fight on the floor of the news from when I got back from shooting the story but in the years since I've lost other battles like that and I know\nThat it's a mix of set of interests come to the table when you're making these decisions and they are not always motivated by the prime interest of informing the public when entertainment tonight went on the air it made itself look like a newscast\nAccess Hollywood looks like a newscast they take on the visual language the symbolic language a box over the anchor shoulder while he or she is reading a piece of entertainment news it's meant to elevate\nGossip from Hollywood and the news of the release of a new movie to the same level as fighting in the middle east famine in Africa a crisis where the currency in Southeast Asia that affects the price of something we buy announce stores\nIt is tough to balance all those interests\nAnd the news business because it's so insecure about its business model has to go with what's going to sell and then maybe if we have some time afterward we can have this higher tones conversation about what matters and what's important and what our viewers listeners readers should no\nOne can argue of course that we are not only living in the golden age of narrative but we're living in the golden age of media\nIn the Democratic sensing the pluralistic sense that every single\nIdea can be heard and we have a surplus of ideas but at least we have all the ideas in front of us there aren't very many fringe views that if they don't make it to the news hour or two ABC News on prime time for any other network they are available in a podcast or they're available in a YouTube channel\nAnd people can get it but we have been talking of course\nAbout the fragmentation of viewership as a result of that one of the questions\nThat I often returned to is the emergence of sports as another aspect of the news media\nThat ends up making us less in this cosmopolitan than connected with the rest of the world\nIn more insular in only attached to our own team or our own I can the media creates a kind of coup coon where did you are inside whatever is outside whatever connects us with the other parts of the world is less marketable offers less attraction and entertainment and\nWe had so much fun last year we are doing it again New England public radio second annual

connected with sports too but at the same time it alone and here's what's really fascinating\nAbout this at the same time as it's creating parochialism has its reinforcing small this as you put in the boundaries of your community around you and I care about this team\nIt's creating cosmopolitan as him at the very same moment here where we're talking in a studio in Massachusetts\nThere are bars where when there is a key game in the English Premier League or the Spanish top professional league that bar will fill up with partisans of ... Madrid or your event is\nAC Milan or Manchester United\nAnd you will be able to consume sports in a way that you never were able to in the history of the world you had to wait till the next day's newspaper to open up and look for the tiny type\nThe back of the sports section to find out whether ever to be Sheffield we are able to satisfy every taste even the tiniest minority taste as so often happens in this conversation\nAbout this surplus supply this incredible endless supply of inventory we are creating cosmopolitan ism and creating parochialism\nIn the very same moment with no sense of contradiction no sense of cross purposes it's just that there's so much stuff that we can satisfy every appetite and satisfy every desire\nI'm fascinated by the viewership and the listeners ship that sports have in that tension between the rural and the ... and that come together\nAlso by the tribalism that results from the passion for this particular teams which are not about the Boston area\nPlayers but really the players come from all over and ended up representing Boston or the Yankees or the couple of years or the angels or whoever it is there is something that sports dogs that follows precisely the line of argument that you and I have been developing which is\nLet me give you an ... let me give you forget fullness let me give you a drug that will make you forget the media to reality that you are living in\nFor two hours or three hours and do so with the adrenalin running in ... we are going to be a happy channel because we're going to get all these viewers\nThat are going to result in more advertising you are going to be excited because you will forget the routine that you exist in in what is left out is the rest of the world to the what is left out is that manufacturing of the reduction of our attention into this particular story maybe I'm sounding\nLike an anti sports person here in okay should I have to say I find watching a baseball game incredibly relaxing intellectually relaxing but I also think that to watching them seven days a week\nAt the expense of the many other stories that are out there is in\nCreatively distressing I think this is the moment where a lot of our listeners are going to say oh goodness what a cynic because in the world is news when in some form\nA sportsman sports woman or a team does something that helps connect sports to the normal news diet they have a little orgasm they go crazy this is great because now we don't even have to talk about the news we can talk about sports\nEven more thank you Colin Kaepernick\nFor kneeling on the sideline because now we can elevate football from just a game to something that in a pinch is on the actual culture wars going on around patriotism and the flag and what it means to kneel during the star Spangled Banner it may sound harsh but thank you domestic abuse or\nProfessional sports players because now we get to gravely talk about the real problem of domestic ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nElectric current and gives us an excuse to talk about sports even more goodness gracious it is one of the worst tendencies of the conventional news business\nTo look for ways not to relate real life to sports but to relate sports to quote unquote real life so you don't even have to wait until it's time to give the scores for the ... guy on the set to say oh boy was a bad night for the Yankees\nBut instead you can put it up higher in the newscast\nAnd talk about steroids can talk about homophobia you can talk about bullying you can talk about traumatic brain injury\nThe best of all possible worlds is when you can relate a serious news story this something that has to do with sports\nIf I went into my kitchen right now if I got up from the living room couch and went into my kitchen and turn the Tappan that water came out I'd be in the same boat as this person being not all wide shot of an enormous reservoir which says nothing to people\nBut that one real person and this is a term of art you'll often hear an argument's inside the news business real people [laughter]\nAs if the other ones are fake but real people make these stories real to our audiences and this is in whatever medium we're talking about\nLike this hierarchy that you have presented of the reach the middle class and the poor and the poor being about the who the story is going to be\nBecause I think that in our conversation about how to change things we have to begin by acknowledging that there is that a landscape that is being changed right now and that is the landscape of country that is moving through beat pains\nFrom one called urge single sighted approach where white and his wife at the very center of just about everything\nTo countries that accepts diversity increasingly in therefore accepts those that are delivering the news\nAs recognizing that real people will have different values\nThat you can no longer ... by the suffering of a white person in one particular way and the suffering of a black person or a brown person in a different way now we're not there yet\nWe are beginning to transform this but who is delivering the news is changing so I Am thinking who is a real person a real person is whoever we can tap\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nInch when the majority of the viewers are no longer from a particular group but\nAre diverse they come from a larger plurality\nSo let me stop you right there because I think that process will be slower\nThan demographics might justify because let's say as a term of art non white people\nHave been trained to universe allies their humanity\nTo see humanity in people not like themselves as a way of navigating the world because they don't see people like themselves being presented in media\nAs a default model for all humanity so if you're doing a medical story about a clinical trial and this has actually happened that some of the networks they have favored\nWhite participants in the clinical trial because they want the audience to identify because they know that black and brown people who have always had to find their heroes they're villains their identify fires\nIn a world that is not like them we'll just go along and do that because they always do\nAnd white people will never have to stretch never have to re imagine who is a default proxy for themselves in their own humanity they have not been asked on a regular basis to imagine themselves\nLike these other people who are their fellow Americans there's already been testing and surveys and polls\nThat show they can't identify when the protagonist of the story when the corps person in the story is a person that's two unlike them while minority people have always had to do that\nThink that demographics in maybe we will always be one step behind demographics but I Do believe that the speed with which things are changing at the demographic level in the social economic aspects of life are going to push this society in this site is going to become willy nilly model for others where immigration now\nIs increasingly the topic of the day paradigm of where things\nMust go just as we talked about the tyranny of the new\nThere is going to be soon the tyranny of the plural in that plurality is going to dictate\nThe fact that we won more Black Panther and we want more\nAvengers that have different types of superheroes and that you can have Latino superheroes or Asian superhero that I'm not for Latinos but that are for everybody else would not bother ... there's also the other aspect that you were talking about re and that is the humanity of this kind of just as you said\nWe don't see the full humanity\nIn the people who are not like us I think that America is\nAt a crucial moment at a turning point\nIn humanizing those that have been part of the society\nIn a way that can allow the whole country to move into the future\nBecause I think that that is what\nThe black lives matter movement which connects with the civil rights era and the me too movement are about\nHumanizing a segment of the population that has always been seen as the recipient of stories that come from the other side I Want to add one more elements here and that is\nThat we've been talking about the way money shapes the news and I don't want to be naive I don't want to suggest that the abundance the overwhelming nature of American media would level itself off in ...\nWhen the surplus is comes down when people get tired of just binge watching series and reconnect with life\nAnd you almost see my more skeptical cells in the back saying careful about what you say but some regulation asking government to do something is always disastrous but some regulation that comes with\n[noise] we had so much fun last year we are doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that\nFor it from the media to its quixotic it's almost like separating the air from the environment in which we leave but if we don't become more conscious of how the special interests are they finding the stories that we are getting all the time\nAnd if we don't recognize\nThat there is a paralysis in the surplus that we are receiving our own you will tell you that they feel that their iPhones are killing them that the amount of stuff that has to be posted is numbing\nI think that has to be some sort of push by the people in the protests like wait\nTo see the media belongs to us the media doesn't belong to this special interests well regulation\nJust the word regulation whether it's got a capital are small are at the beginning gives people in my part of the world the Willie is we don't like to hear that word is anathema to many\nAnd it is contrary to American traditions really in how we create\nA media environment and that goes back to the earliest days of the republic I think what you're seeing though is the pioneering of new forms\nNew public interest forms that we'll supply some of these much needed a much desired but not very ... parts of the news business\nAnd make sure that they remain in supply so ProPublica sets up with a not for profit model is backed by well heeled wealthy people who say they have an interest in making sure that the news business\nContinues to do serious investigative work and as the uh less and less profitable business does less and less serious investigations the pro public or the center for Public Integrity the Poynter Institute there's a whole new nonprofit world that's rising up\nTo meet the demand\nFor the maintenance of a serious rigorous\nCurious and strong news sector at a time when those things are considered expensive a luxury NATO ratings driver and so on\nIt is a little disconcerting as I watch this unfold this new era of not for profit journalism to see companies that have so much money and could do all this stuff on their own instead saying\nBecause money's fungible we don't have to do that anymore we can even turn more of our money into profit so will allow pro public to do it\nSo an ABC News which is owned by Disney which has more money than God and could do all the investigative news it once forever till the end of time besides instead to use and use as partners these non for profit storytelling outfits and take some of their content\nThe bargain that struck\nBetween the not for profit news generator and the big profitable network is that I Will give you something you don't have\nAudience and the other side says I Will give us something that you don't have content and they make this bargain and they shake hands on it and a company that could very well afford to keep an entire investigative unit fully funded and well paid and kicking ass\nThey decide not to do it and this was predictable as this new model began to rise and frankly do some tremendous stories", "show_name": "Writer's Voice ", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "28"}
