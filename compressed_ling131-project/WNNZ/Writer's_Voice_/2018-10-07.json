certify naturally ruined Amherst firms or sixteen bay road open six days a week Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nChapman felt about Apple's we assume because of his nickname because of the years that he spent plant they know our church that he was passionate about this fruit but we have no record of it and even the stories about him have very little to do with Apple's on the other hand was\nVery passionate about apples and wrote a very beautiful essay called wild apples\nAnd he also writes about apples in his book Cape Cod about his three walks on the link to the Cape\nAnd um what I suggested in his book is it\nA thorough in effect give language to what we believe Chapman cell based on Chapman's lifestyle but we don't have Chapman's record for it so you know it's kind of the the feet Easterner Thoreau who gives voice to this guy in the wilderness\nAnd did you just joined writer's voice we're talking with Russell Steven Powell about his beautiful book called Apple's New England users guy\nSo a little bit about the history of New England apple orchards you kind of crime the word to begin with and then how they became commercialize\nWell for the first century from the sixteen hundreds into well into the Seventeen hundreds the apples we're pretty much a part of a typical small farm where people would have a few chickens are they grow their fruits and vegetables and they'd have a little role of apple trees and\nEvery household would make apple butter and apple sauce and lighter side or was really the nation's main drink until about the Eighteen fifties\nAnd it was really only gradually in the Eighteen hundreds that we began to see more and more grafted varieties coming over from Europe and created here in the state\nAnd at that time we began to see larger and larger orchards being planted in there began to be an export market for apples and\nWe would ship apples in barrels from Maine and Boston to England in particular\nBut also the west indies and other places so there was a substantial market for our apples and we also ship them domestically to other parts of the Midwest and northeast\nBut apple is generally at that time we're still part of a diversified farm [noise] and it was only in the late Eighteen hundreds and into the Nineteen hundreds that farmers began to really specialize in just growing apples\nAnd with the advent of refrigeration around the Nineteen hundreds and the demise of the arts fighter industry from a pressure resulting from the Temperance movement the apple industry really had to reinvent itself and\nPresent apples is now primarily for fresh heating and\nBecause of refrigeration they could grow fewer varieties instead of having early ones that could be available as early as late July but didn't keep very well done something that would be very hard throughout the winter or could be packed late into the fall\nGrowers gradually were able to\nGrow concentrate on fewer variety that could be picked over a much shorter season and the emphasis was no longer on strictly side or but on a fresh eating an apple and uh it was in Nineteen oh for that or a man named John distance and came up with a phrase\nAn apple a day will keep the doctor away and uh that kind of signal this big change and an apple growing at the time New England was still a major player nationally\nThis was well before Washington state began producing much in the way of Apple's so we were still a big supplier\nAnd the big varieties around Nineteen hundred\nDreaming of New England public radio was funded by you in all energy solar hoping homes and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSeventeen forty in Wilmington, Massachusetts Rhode Island greening and even older apple from the sixteen hundreds originated in Rhode Island at northern spy\nWhich the seeds for the northern spy came from an orchard in Salisbury, Connecticut so we really were major players at the time and that gradually shifted\nOver the course of the twentieth century\nAs a Washington gained prominence and was able to take advantage of much bigger spaces for growing apples and a better climate many respects and a New England had to face some significant weather pressures that's always an issue it's still a ...\nFor example the bald when apple was almost wiped out in the winter of Nineteen thirty three thirty four from a major free them to get his never fully recovered from that\nSo now we have a variety like Macintosh and Cortland andme account an empire that do very well in our soils and have been\nPart of our landscape for a century or more in the cases of Courtland and Macintosh and we're still is a volume wise of small player nationally but certainly within our region apples continue to have a very large presence in our community\nAnd it does seem that some varieties coming back I mean I've been at the ... been run range of varieties many of which I never heard of\nWhat we are discovering over the past say Twenty years\nIs it a lot of these what we consider to be heirloom apples\nHave very good qualities but they may have one flaw that prevents them from\nBeing a mass produced apple across the nation they may grow well only in New England soils or even a portion of New England they may be a great tasting apple but they don't grow to a very large size some apples have a russet skin\nIt's kind of copper colored with a slight say on paper refill and marketers believe that consumers want strictly the bright red that bright green bright yellow apple but some of these reflected apples like Rock Springs\n... are delicious or some of the most flavorful apples out there so I think what we're seeing is people realizing that there's a whole range of flavors and textures and colors available if they are willing to explore a little bit further\nAnd with this I think orchards have responded and even even our larger commercial or church or no replant they in some of these heirloom variety so while some of them may still be hard to find if you're willing to search a little bit you can find a lot of these I think in addition to their food value\nPeople are really fascinated by their unusual histories and that was another reason that I chose to write the book it's hard to think now that an apple could have been discovered in an urban community like data Massachusetts but but but nobody apple was very popular for decades\nAnd then we have unusual names like the west field seat no further from ... Massachusetts and I think that either the names of the stories of the locales for some of these apples really add substantially to their appeal and you feel like you're\nYou're taking a bite not just out of a piece of fruit but out of a piece of our history", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Writer's Voice ", "city": "Westfield", "day": "07"}
