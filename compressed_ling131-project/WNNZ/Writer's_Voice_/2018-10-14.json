writer's voice it's been quite a while it has been a while yeah yeah we\nFirst spoke with you um we spoke with you about your first book your debut novel the lotus eaters but now your latest your fourth novel that removes first just tell us about the title\nI always you know sometimes you just come up stumble across the right thing I'm On this one I was reading captivity narratives\nAnd the the the first really famous one was the story the narrative that the captivity a of Mary role and son and she puts in and her section each is like the first second third remove\nUm and I just it kind of it seemed mysterious word and she's talking about it in a religious context you know being taken away from her faith and all of this stuff but I just I thought it was just was interesting and mysterious and it applies to Adam who is who is the captive but it also applies to Libya and texture even\nSo um I I just liked it it kind of um it kind of worked for me to be thinking and that term while I was writing the book\nAnd so you know as you said this is really about the the Indian Wars or the war of the wars of the settlers against the Indians is the west was being settled\nThe book opens with an app a graph by crazy horse racing a very great vision is needed in the man who has it must follow it\nYou know when I read that I thought who are you referring to are you referring to yourself is the author or are you in some ironic censoring to cost her\nI'm actually just referring to the lack of it and the book there there is nobody that had that so you know when I when\nI write historical fiction I'm always thinking about it in a very contemporary way and I try to write it that way and I have they should be that way and so I just what I included all the historical like the little documents and everything I think it's kind of shocking when you actually put yourself back in that time that nobody\nNobody had any vision and that's how it happened it's not like everybody\nWas you know they are intelligent people back then but the the the ideas that were traveling around were just shocking and to think that people had to act on it you know and even ... and we have this idea that cuts are like was that crazy man he wasn't that crazy man he was a very practical matter and he was a soldier but he had no\nHe had no ability to do anything then why he did you know other than if he had quit\nQuit the army but within within the idea of what the government wanted they if they had not cheated and lied and constantly you know done the wrong thing it at least it wouldn't have had the the incredible brutality and and just sadness that that did go on\nAnd so you know I mean I always think about it in a contemporary context is not having somebody with a vision\nSay more about this I mean you know what was done and you know kind of the outlines of me the book has some\nStarts out and in fact was quite a brutal seen this was the scene of actually Indian raid on a white family\nYou cover the brutality on both sides in great degree and when I say both sides I'm not acting like President Trump saying oh well there's good people on both sides and bad people on both sides of the situation I was within this moral universe and and what was happening\nI mean obviously the um the U.S army was trying to get the Indians onto the reservations and so you know they basically they were supposed to surrender or they would be killed you know and and and a lot of times we didn't give them a chance to even move on\nDreaming of New England public radio was won by ... Franklin Community are offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield in children's goal community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd a lot of the soldiers and a lot of the people that were out there I mean it was the wild west and they know they just it ... the cost of life we know is very low and they were good people\nOut there that we're trying to get the government but when they would send a letter to Washington and it would take two weeks to get back or response and the responses from people who knew nothing about what was really going on on the ground\nSo it it was just a losing formula and of course uh the native tribes I mean I read that there had encroachment and they would get a treaty and it would be lied about and the only the only hope they had to do was to be threatening enough to try to roll back the the progression of the settlers and so\nJust the threat of violence you know there were some towns and I think I have one little seeing in the book there were some towns that were abandoned because the settlers were so scared of the danger that they they went back east and so basically that that's what they wanted and you know it was retaliation and revenge for incredible brutality\nSo um it's just it's it's\nI always I'm thinking of these characters and I'm thinking you know what was it really like to go to be to be alive at that time and what we what would you be afraid of what you and I know what would you and I'd be afraid of if we went out and getting their you know and so that that's kind of where I'm coming from I just wanted to create through what\nWhat it really was like and it was really brutal from both sides and that's that's basically you know the political leverage that people had was you know\nA brutality and violence and killing each other\nMy ... and was it really hard to write that actually those scenes\nIt's ... it's really hard it's really hard um you know it's it's a it's kind of a dark place and so when I like on my first book I mean doing the research and everything um [noise]\nI think you know for me it's something that I was very interested in I like to I ...\nI always it's so interesting when you go to schools and when you go to colleges even colleges that the students don't really they just remember kind of vague things from history and they don't really have a feeling for what it was like I said to me it's really important to have a sister on you know parts of it are unpleasant and if you met those parts then you're not accurately\nTo that original yeah of course the ... I think it's interesting because you know it it it was a open knowledge that he had had affairs with on so some of these ports were very small amount of individuals there and he would have an affair with somebody else's wife\nAnd it would be known quickly you know everybody would know and of course Libya with no it too and why she did not leave him why she didn't go back home um she made the choice to stay\nFor many years offering a special on her own just be beholden burning on Saturdays him or her grow up you know you're not\nA ... in your window that she had had kind of a flirtation who knows how far it went with one officer while he was gone and that was the big thing where he left left his command basically after he got them into a position\nAnd he took a train overnight to go see her and he actually got court martialed for that for for dereliction of duty\nBecause he was so jealous so they kind of had this thing it wasn't she she was not like just the wrong woman and suffering and staying at home she kind of fight back a little bit and so that scene it was just kind of you know a\nDramatize during her reaction she did not have the reaction that you would expect from somebody of her time and place\nMrs writers toys just Korean and and I'm Talking with cartoonist who leads a novelist and short story writer about her newest novel the room moved now you have some other characters in the book and one I'd like to talk about in particular is\nGolden buffalo oh he's a young Indian\nWho has had visions or had visions that drive them into the customer service telling about\nUm you know obviously I I read a lot about the tribes and there were um\nThey kind of ... at that point the wondering how they were going to deal with this onslaught now they were going to keep their cultures intact um there was the the faction that wanted to you know fight 'til the end and then there was a pacifist and a lot of the pacifist said we have to learn a how to\nLive in the white society so that we can you know thrive on our own and and at that point at some point in the future take it back so I Would say that they were not accommodation is like they were going to you know\nUnder sell their culture but they thought that was the only way to survive and of course there was a lot of people saying you know that's being a traitor that you are not you know really fighting for your people\nSo they had a lot of 'em fighting within within the the different tribes of how they were going to deal with it and golden buffalo\nDoes suffer I mean he is part of when black kettle you know thought he had a immunity from being attacked and his tribe was actually massacred at the sand creek massacre and so he has that in his in his you know\nLife that he knows that you cannot trust the words that they're going to tell you but he also when he does get violent he realizes that they are just going to really kill themselves they're like dashing themselves on the rocks they'd have no chance and so he makes that choice\nTo try to figure out you know what can I figure out from working with the enemy of what can I figure out to bring back\nAnd so I I there were people that did that and he has you know a a sue and shy and parent one age and so he's kind of a little bit between the culture is also I mean he's not totally rooted in one and so I think he's he's the type of person who is able to make that that movement out\nAnd and obviously when you go out to get to know the enemy you you make friends with in it and so not that he ever becomes clusters friend but he comes to kind of respect and admire Custer and there were a lot of the scouts that worked with him that did admire him just on the level of being\nBrave that's one of the things that they valued and also being you know an incredible a soldier he had amazing abilities tactical abilities and everything he would always be in the front of any engagement he would not be sitting in the back\nI mean they they despise cowardly nest and so in a way he's dealing with the enemy but he comes to\nYou know maybe not like the enemy that comes to you know have a certain respect for them\nAnd he actually has a coaster has the heart of an Indian\nAnd that is a real quote by somebody\nAnd cut himself regard him comes to regard him as a friend to the relationship between him and culture and what that says not\nJust about these two individuals but about the relationship between them in their respective social positions\nI mean I ... I think\nDreaming of New England public radio was willing to do you all energy solar hoping homes businesses owned firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nRunning the policy of of what was going on and the west\nThey did not know\nPersonally did not know any of the Native Americans and so that people on the ground that were in the frontier and there are actually working every day with the tribes\nThere are quite a few soldiers that actually sacrifice their careers because they said we cannot you know do these policies and this is unfair and and it is and it is immoral and so the people that actually get to know each other\nThey end up being friends they end up\nHaving respect and understanding for each other and so there were a lot of\nThis was you know obviously a fictionalized relationship because there was no golden buffalo but there were lots of relationships like this with Custer with his scouts and he had that there were you know different shapes that he would work with and and he would negotiate releases of of um the hostages and everything and he\nHe had this thing once one one time they had taken some uh chieftains a hostage and he would actually go there and you know sit down and and smoke a pipe and and and have dialogue with him\nHe was very interested in the culture he he learned words he he got that she'd be erected in his little cap and he was just kind of more interested in the other and and now of course that's always a central and\nIf the people that were actually out there had been able to do the policy it would have been so much less brutal of course they couldn't\nYou know ... what was happening but it wouldn't have been the lack of understanding\nAnd yet he also killed she's black kettle who was killed at the Washington a massacre by Custer she kennel you mentioned him before he was one of the pacifist who sought to the Indian needed to learn to live within the society\nSo I mean this is a you know very hum contradictory this story a poster we know him as the\nThe guy who massacre the Indians wounded knee so you what is this like for ... read a little a quote here from coast to actually\nWhich expresses one side of this big wins the Indian cannot be themselves and be civilized he fades away dies if I were in India you know I think I Would greatly prefer to cast my lot among those of my people\nAdhere to the free open plains rather than submit to the confined limits reservation\nThere to be the recipient of the blasted benefits of civilization within slices thrown in I mean what do you make of this\nI mean I think that's what\nI was getting out when you have these people that are working out on the frontier in the territories I mean Custer admired that life he would spend you know they would take a campaign out and he would be gone for months living in the wilderness he had\nThe soldiers the calorie especially had that nomadic existence so actually their lifestyle would mimic the planes Indians who are warriors and on horse more than they would uh anybody like living in the cities of the east\nSo he felt like a real kinship with them I mean he said he had never seen\nSuch incredible mastery the warriors and you know what incredible soldiers they were and how they rode a horse he said if I had a a regiment of soldiers as good as they could win anything and he is a warrior he had the heart of a warrior and so he admired them on that level but he's also he was basically\nAfter after the civil war he was you know demoted to a captain\nHe had to follow orders um\nThere was no saying I have a different opinion and and being able to affect policy at all that few soldiers that did that and that was not custard by the way because he was very interested in his fame and his career and he did not he didn't fall in the store to ever\nYou know to do this but if you had refused orders or something I mean you would be court martialed and killed there was not the policy of saying you know this is immoral and and I am not gonna do it or could he have done better of course\nWhat was interesting to me is that I knew nothing about Custer when I started\nDreaming of New England public radio was funded by ... small ones worm certified naturally ruined fruit farm in our merged with a farm standards for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nCustomers are relatively small cog in the story he's famous because of the last down but in in terms of of what he actually accomplished he kept accomplish relatively you know a small amount in comparison he just became famous\nProbably because of the long hair and his ego and all the pictures taken of themselves and that aspect of his personality is was totally there and I think that's why we're also talking about him\nRight now you have historical photos and clips like when I just read quotes from contemporary sources talk about me into reading a fiction in fact the way you did you approach them with some of the challenges\nBoth are accounts reported that the banks were filled with you know large town you know thousands of people was very dicey going down there in fact because of Spaniards for so outnumbered\nAnd they would report that there'll be many many miles of villages you know without a story on it or a or one of the oriental reports said that there was a mild villages without it you know one cross ...\nBetween them which is a couple of hundred yards and so in his mouth the top hosts there is a very large city but in theory could have had as many as four hundred thousand and have it it's a little bit since probably two large\nThat's again a ah the gearing rats have gone to her\nOr her ... he he was a ... they were they were pretty bad guys that the last movie isn't exactly historically accurate all those wonderful movie\nYou connect some of these ah different says well actually it sounds like all along it's been a very highly politicized scholarship and you can call it that of the pre conquest people's here that's been done by European by whites\nBut you you say that the given the charge relations between white in native peoples that the including into Indian culture and history is inevitably contention for example you talk about the pristine\nAnd and the ecological indications of some recent discoveries I Wonder if you could talk about that and they can and then if you want broaden that out too\nWell sure I mean all history is politically charged witness the fights that we've had about\nShould the American curriculum emphasized slavery and you know should we teach the negative parts of American history and you have from these fights over historical standards and then you add to that the very complicated issue of race and these different cultures\nAnd particularly for for this is for um Native Americans which\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools and asked in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications that they pass dot edu\nSides you know court cases of all this kind of stuff happening and you ended up with something inevitably particularly charged and one of his simple reasons is that we have been taught what they call it the the pristine missed the term was invented by the geographer a lame duck session of the University of Wisconsin\nAnd side effect of that is that you know if the countryside was a wilderness that kind of OK to move in its very uncomfortable to think that the countryside is full of people\nKnow there is a big fight also over kind of my contention algae what's this myth deliberately passed on to make a Europeans and their descendants feel better maybe it's clear that there's a lot of Europeans who moved into the mid west and west thought\nThat it was pretty empty and the reason for that was it they didn't understand what had happened about the diseases that arrived before them\nI think that's that's something that a lot of people don't understand is that those diseases actually he said the conquest as you say and killed about Ninety six percent\nSomething like that I mean you know it's this kind of figure they're inexact but I think there's a general agreement that they killed more than Ninety percent and some people believe you know up to Ninety eight percent whatever the figure it was the greatest demographic catastrophe in the history of mankind just a a dreadful thing\nYou want to have something so awful happening you want to assign blame was very difficult because neither the Europeans nor the Indians that they are contacted\nHad the modern understanding of disease\nEuropeans of course understood contagion they understood that disease that could be transmitted between people but they didn't understand the mechanism and in fact basically they understood the disease could be transmitted but whether it was that was the will of God and the Indians more or less I understood it in the same way\nUm they didn't because epidemic disease was you know ... it was just there wasn't much of it I'm In the Americas\nThey didn't really have any kind of mechanisms that defense like quarantine or you know any kind of natural immunity because they hadn't been exposed to it and so these terrible diseases would sweep through\nWas something beyond their experience I may have also attributed to the to the will of God\nSo you have to pre scientific viewpoints there\nAnd I'm not sure if guilty is ah the the right way to think about this kind of stuff naturally you know our politicized environment you know that's what people want to do and so when you talk about this you know people one side of the political arguments say oh you're just trash in Europe\nAnd I'm On the other side and say see they were you know how awful they were as I think that pets are imposing our own particular corals on on people who had their own viewpoints and experiences and it's much more interesting to try and say how how do they think about it\nAnd also just just scientifically that because they didn't have a practice domesticating animals that they were subject to the disease\nYeah most of the really bad epidemic diseases that what's it called crowd diseases\nAre animal diseases that have you know through mutation of jumped species barrier and landed in people's smallpox came from you know ... it's kind of thing that just is argue about\nMeasles is a variant unfold on Rinder past which has a cow disease that we're starting to learn a human influenza that comes from you know birds especially ducks so you have the bird flu that were scared of right now\nAnd are Europeans and Asians lived around domesticated animals in fact they share their houses with them by ... of the evolutionary history they were very few domestic Hubble animals in the new world in every other muscle called new world\nSo you you you still can't domesticate by the way you can ah ... cattle\nAnd as a result Indians just simply didn't live around animals the way that Europeans did\nAnd those kind of crowd diseases didn't never have a chance to develop and in fact\nIf you eating and that sort of science fiction all you know alternate world that if that did happen and you're in Indians had develop their own diseases all their lives have been much more miserable but when the Europeans came misled or would have been two way and it would have been absolutely devastating for both sides\nDreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and the farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSo part of this pristine methods that uh you know the Indians lived in a kind of it didn't act integration with nature but you talk about some of the ecological implications of some recent discoveries I Wonder if you could tell us what they are\nThey new perspective from and this was mainly taken from a geographer it's who have been trying to understand that the the broad scale changes in ecosystems over over time is that ... that Indian like let people everywhere manage their landscape in many cases they're extraordinarily successful at it we have much to learn from them [laughter]\nThe pristine methods that they somehow didn't touch anything didn't disturbing anything that you know people live with like these gold flight presence is\nAnd there's that kind of curious feeling to say about Indians that they are unique among all people on the earth this kind of ecological Pepsi's that didn't have any impact on their environment it's a it's a very odd kind of\nI guess the academic term is essential is argument to argue that somehow these people alone had this essence that was different from everybody else it's kinda creepy when you think about it [laughter]\nBut whether our understanding is there to these landscapes worth thoroughly marked by the the human presence\nAnd the political implications of that are that much of for instance American environmental laws is animated by the idea that we should return the landscape to it's pre Columbian you know essence which is seen as a wilderness I mean that's the idea of the wilderness act and so forth\nAnd then to say wait a minute these landscapes are managed concentrations fear that this is you know opens the way for the bulldozers developers can say oh this was in the wilderness at all they're forced okay to pay that all\nThat are certainly some people will argue that but it also suggests to us than what we need to do is not so much to leave the land alone will be very thoughtful about how we use it and it's also to me it's just very hopeful awful idea that we can work with nature in a way that the that they did in concrete something really nice\nYou're listening to voters boy and we're talking with Charles man about his new book fourteen Ninety One new revelations of the Americas before Columbus\nYeah there's a lot we can learn from them and and one of the things I Love about your book is how did\nYou brought these people many different people's many different cultures in the Americas really alive and I was fascinated by your description of how the hell grants must have appeared to the masses Indians who are here in Massachusetts\nDo you have a book with you I just like you to read a short section of it on the bottom of page thirty one and the shopkeepers peculiarity\nOkay like I read that I Love it short Europeans have been visiting New England for at least a century shorter than the native oddly dressed and often unbearably dirty the palate foreigners to kill your blue eyes of peeped out of the masks of briefly animal like hair that in case their faces\nThey're irritating leaderless ... if it's such a cannery and often surprisingly incompetent what seemed Indian flick basic tasks\nBut they also made useful and beautiful goats copper cut old glittering colored glass Steagall knives match it's unlike anything else from New England moreover they would exchange these valuable items for cheaper so the sword used by Indians as blankets\nThere was like happening upon ... that would swap fancy electronic goods for customers you socks almost anyone would be willing to overlook the shopkeepers peculiarities\nThat takes place in sixteen Twenty one I guess that's when right\nI mean one of the sort of um things I'm writing a book about\nYou know the Americas before
