Sunday evenings are living on earth\nWe generally avoids the lightning rod figures on this show\nBut earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana Sen Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in\nThe two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson she was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta she ... she agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible a true back and forth marked at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor\nAnd a willingness to bring our questions as well as our argument our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nI'm stupid and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana\nAnd was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I moved to two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway

on dual axis trackers hoping household with carbon free and before one free valley solar dot solar\nAnd progressive commentator Sally come\nTo think that this phenomenon of troll is like a\nLight is made possible by the Internet on the other hand it's just it's a dark side of the human condition with a new canvas that the anonymity and then ending is embodied [laughter]\nI'm\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well she said he said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying that you know\nThat you actually called a bunch of them\nUp a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls\nEven the word we choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live on damages and throw rocks at a very deep you speak humanizing latch yes um\nAnd I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean\nNo one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just trolls talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these trolls didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or are cooler unkind\nUm and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio on line um\nAnd they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm\nNo one thinks they're mean\nNo one wants to be hateful so can you do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well the only thing I'll just say and this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right\nNow but still they were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and reads forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and\nThey had the opportunity a lot of them apologize and all that thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with\nA lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to we behave more kindly to there's this ...\nOf technology that then allows us to fuel the demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of\nNurturing amplify it yeah yeah yeah [noise] um\nMhm so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't\nI don't care who does it worse I happened to have an opinion on the matter about [noise] uh I don't actually know what I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric is I I've come to think that ah that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and\nThat's\nActually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing\nSo here's two and he was offering us Federal Reserve will be a long term storage and his baby ... party on Saturday December her grab your tickets no you're not\nThere and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nAmong liberal to say oh air game Trump supporters me that there are still faces and they're so as long as ... I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out I Know\nAnd we blame the people for then expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some\nFaith in people's intentions to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard and this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I Try very hard\nTo assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me in spite\nOf some of the some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me uh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that in sort of in the pension but it's also I I Want to believe the best and people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou know you've actually call that a daily spiritual practice fats is you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this\nWhich is that the culture we have created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like Sam so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something\nI mean you said a lot of us here in ... but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have had many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes and I've had to talk too much when I wrote about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and you know and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what us you know saying this has to do with repairing\nCivil discourse\nYou know if it was totally made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a\nCouple of dozen people on Twitter the diamond riches friends and it wasn't my remark was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way\nAnd the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like more of a record on those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\nI'm you know look I think it's very ... to point it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries ... paws other firms down small ones farm dot\nCom but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that ... that\nEspecially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is yeah I Want to be nicer I Want everyone to hate last and I think progressive should lead the way\nTo go first\nIf you'd like to the points that were making here or if there was a free ride that professes\nUm that people can change and grow\nAnd in fact that is a core of progressive politics\nIs that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the\nDivisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that\nUm the thing though I Would tell you is to go full circle to wear this night began or just yeah don't\nShoot motives to someone when you don't really know their motives um a lot of people believe a lot of things some people believe things that are mutually contradictory I think we all do I know I Do\nUm but don't him shooting motives to the person you you haven't walked in their shoes you don't know their background\nAnd we could all do a better job particularly at the local level in a PGA or or whatnot ... it may not be that they just want to a way to get their kid to hit it over your kid they may have real\nReal reasons for wanting to ... ... getting out of ... motives would go a long way to helping things\n[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street\nDreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nI mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological\nUh it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we've quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of Mexico so [laughter]\nWhat are there are studies that you know look kids to go to\nRacially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask us we um [noise] as we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah [noise] we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or\nA proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect\nAt this you know Sally have said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you're not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in can still be on\nSocial media so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift what shifts what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um have\nThe experience myself of\nBeing unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel\nOn line or off and seeing the difference it makes\nIn yourself in for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it [noise]\nBut it in them as well\nUh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like a\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean there are credibly powerful stories of people who\nYou know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the target of that hate showed\nKindness and generosity\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay past dot edu\n... on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking more hateful showed them kindness and I say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels ... and and then in some cases it's too much to ask you to laugh at other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up yeah\nAnd also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people\nLike they are all\nExtraordinary and beautiful in equal\nAnd so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I'm blown away\nBy the difference it makes\nIt which I'm always struck you ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture that what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the serpent in the apple sexually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and so many of us concoct relationships and communities on line and we're still alone\nAnd then we get in our tribes\nA Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy and\nI really push myself more and more\nTo to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people and you know we were with a wife who has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on\nLine a and not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee ... we both began having these internal conversations um with having kids um that\nLevel of local and I don't mean to keep our with our local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know um there's there's a great Christian author was area Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse\nAnd she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America than the gay community\nWhere an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings are blessed to be shared with over there\n\nFree Jesus and how\nIt is [noise]\nWe under value in the twenty first century\nReal
