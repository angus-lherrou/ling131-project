about it and to me this comes through in you talking about um\nThe deep story cars and that and as you said the fact facts and moral ... a rise out of the deep joined we'll actually have to take some milk shake that mattered a nor I\nMoved from right about facts and it's not about moral and writes either it's a Phelps true yeah and I mean when I went back and forth between Berkeley and and the people I came to know and really respect and\nThe other world of the south um\nSouthwest Louisiana I came to to realize that there were different truths you differently truth and so there are facts I Believe in the reality shows yes yes the deep story and again we all have a deep story um\nIt ...

own\nUm take up what you\nCall it the whole issue um to kind of go deep into what are the dynamics that collect around a specific subject and to to really understand the dynamic sending turn of the great paradox and um [noise] you know you point at this dynamic that in the\nPart of the country you're in there as well first of all and I'm ... and beautiful natural environment and great pollution and great really resist Esther regulating polluters and I think that's such an example of where\nUm people from the outside of all the dynamics that go into that which say um it's just obvious\nAnd but you know there's a there's a background I think right [noise] um partly I think the people I came to know a in Louisiana felt that the federal government was\nA bigger better version of local government and the truth is that in the state of Louisiana a local government out it's the state government has not protected people okay from pollution\nYou know there's a there's this pathogen in the book that I uh and strangers in their own land that I\nI just just just as an example of this and maybe this person you're talking about you know Harold ... the state which seems to come down on the little guy he no he says his take this by you if your motor boat leaks little gas into the water the word no right you up but if companies like thousands of gallons of it and kill all the life

the moral charity work to the state\nSo they say okay you know let's let's get a legislature that goes along with our develop let's talk jobs jobs jobs\nAnd so the company is with the money that the state gives them in it for it I think it was one point six billion dollars that a boy was in the last five years and there is an offer to companies yeah\nTo come in with that public money now with

meanwhile state officials the Louisiana department of environmental quality\nIs being very weak and giving out permits a [noise]\nAs one of the people I interviewed like candy so the state looks terrible the company looks good it's kind of emotional actual manipulation you can say to get you to feel like the company is your friend and to feel like the state does your enemy [noise]\nYeah and there's ... you also described [noise] this interesting dynamic that um\nThat again is is ... it's not something that would be obvious anybody on a lot of this is true but I'm for example\nYou um you\nYou had this chapter called there are members\nAnd there is something where you are you a decision made ... about a sociological understanding that memory just in general is an indirect expansion of power\nAnd then you say so ironically strangely embarrassingly the memory of southern environmental glory fell in part to respectful clerks and federal offices internal environmental us so much complexity\nTheir heart does mine yeah oh yeah yeah\nBecause people I came to know are no more about the environment you know you know which fish are in what area where you said the crab pots where\nYou know what ducks you can shoot at what period of of the year\nThey love their land and yet\nAnd yet they're they're caught I mean people working in the plants and I talked to a woman who said you know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about the environment she said you know our neighbors working plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused [noise]\nYou know as if the people working the plants would take on the guilt right along with it and you know and it is it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you're right like California's very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environments result it's at that level of guilt it's not a personal one right so that I was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel accused [noise]\nYeah [noise] and scan poignant this whole thing gets\nAs well and what you are shining a light

thinking by having a simple a respectful public conversation yeah you know where nobody is bullying conversational anybody else you know you are you coming together\nTo see if there can be common ground on the environment\nAnd there can be I think the people I came to know we're very interested and very approving of\nRenewables in fact there's something called the green tea move that as Tea Party that's all for renewables\nBut we're not even finding common ground because we aren't even respectfully reaching out to look for it right here in our bubble still in fact I I think that problem remains with us\nAnd especially on the left I think uh there's a kind of a rigid sort of it we're turning I Would say I find it very sad I think we have to reach out looking for potential common ground\nIn fact do that all the time because I didn't see what do you mean when you when we say you know do you is it a moment where you say okay my butt but actually we had it's habit we have in in the other player I'd be drawn at work right because you can't just put out well how you really feel about what's that one set at every\nMoment of a no no they're rules about that there should be some kind of a ground rules of social life [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah one thing I've been getting really better at it than than we are so that's a great invitation yeah it doesn't mean that you're ... see that's the misunderstand the I think yeah especially on the left oh if you listen to them that means you've been taken over and a\nHunting not at all no mhm no I don't know ... it just means being emotionally intelligent\nYou've developed way of talking\nUm yeah actually that is the fundamental floor of social interaction and when you barrel on in there and ignore the competence and [noise] uh\nIdentities personality too yeah shift counterproductive it\nIs counterproductive and yeah I sometimes want to say the way people talk down to\nUm\nKnow any point straight that might be made I I

um [noise] uh that regulation\nThat a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we call I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense and that government mhm\nMhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government done few that you know maybe they will point may be a\nIt hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed for things that didn't do okay let's figure that out a terrible right back for public conversation about just that [noise]\nIt is a ... the government kind of um [noise] in fact letting people down you know or they expecting too much about what's the record so ah let's let's talk about that and the specifics yeah yeah [noise]\nThere's you know there's a paragraph in your book where you just ... even among the most ardent an extreme I mean I think maybe this was another interview gave you said even among the most ardent extreme people you're mad over five years of research\nYou found specific issues on which there is potential for coalition safeguarding

'cause I didn't go just to another region or when people with different political views I went to a different social class and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nA at the blue collar class that lands that are furious said look we're the daily workers we're\nClimbing the telephone pole to repair our telephone wire were re paving roads where [noise]\nWho are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nAll the little cocoon I've long in here as I Am kind of you know it's not only a contempt the really bothers me whenever I hear it or see it\nUm and that is buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out it's as if\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOnto itself and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said just wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like bam [laughter] what we need our sturdy coalitions and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger and and uh there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft\nDrank right with different colors yeah in in class who's got together natural way it's gonna be the ... each other they we're yes public school systems um but we're down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service
