you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids then kind of really importing put him back into the west you got to be pretty amazing to think back on it and how that's how it\nIs I mean when I first came back I mean the idea [laughter] we were so marginalized that's to put it mildly\n[laughter] and um [noise] uh we\nDidn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully\nAnd then share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and I had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just no one could imagine\n[laughter] right [laughter] [laughter] so\nBut I was just just committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so first I started a\nBusiness with my then husband John Bush and I was eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in a looming nations was integrating this sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice in ...\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nIt's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more complicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but\nAt the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the the season and at the same time the way in which you're doing is helping everyone who's involved to wake up [noise]\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where bear engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that have recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole settles into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right [noise] that is the shaft that is still a still has a long\nWay to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture\nAnd ideals and practicality is yeah this story of a search inside yourself first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't that right\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nYeah [noise] uh actually\nMy friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google that it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so ... decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talked and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart [noise] graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there [laughter]\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could train man and a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they are the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also was in bug guy or with us back all those years right right [laughter]\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and uh the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted in the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand Google lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question and he sang it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down come calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions arise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of deaths in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right wire but this course actually offers enough time practice and teaching to help people do that [noise]\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic Craig's list not as can be superficial and it can be abused it's like any like any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise]\nBut you know there are by something that really selling treats me in um\nIn your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise] that what this tradition is ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator rolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot EDU\nHas is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is a tradition that has focused on that for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing and then\nIn the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to oh yeah this is David ...\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they lose something in your work ... through and seeing that this contemplative impulse\n[noise] it also um\nYou know sometimes I feel like we we hit the twenty first century and I I think that's that's kind of spiritual technology right meditation and mindfulness and contemplation and yeah yeah\nAnd it's all it's likely like we're discovering all these other technology and I'm we're kind of waking up to the spiritual technology that we just need to go back to our senses almost I mean I Wonder a lot about [noise]\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and we're never you know we're always engaged with our phone and I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do it All right\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look around and I mean I Know there was\nBored I mean I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in yeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that\n[laughter] teaching these students are also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation and um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter]\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications that they pass dot edu\nClass you know none of such like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three branches fan and I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and about lying down [laughter] slum right they brought their phones in front of their face [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sacrilegious right [laughter] right\n[noise] well okay so and you get all that beautiful work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ... yeah\nYeah um we devised that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine and plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices if it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just\nType out your email either a response or an initiating email\nAnd then you stop takes a deep brass follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or do you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we ask them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it it was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and I said how did it go\nAnd um [noise] they all said that was radical you know ... and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what he said\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nSorry [laughter] so you know I mean that we all the art emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute 'cause I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really ... I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nWhat what mindfulness compassion practices others helpless is the understanding that it's not\nActing out around your anger and being driven by it on the one hand for repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body\nAnd then notice what your anger is see it\nAnd recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time [noise] hold a compassion and echoing immunity for their situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger 'cause it clouds mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas\nStreaming of New England public radio was one of the ball you all energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money or the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nAnd you're much more likely to both see interesting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we did a lot of work with lawyers and\nJudges and yeah that was I was there anything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nIt's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah you know it's a date with lawyers worry that\nCan they be a village to advocate for their client at the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment\nIt's eliminating pre judgment so that date judges are\nUnbelievably overworked\nThey had so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this was probably who he is and what he's done right and they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it is about two to three seconds long kind of interesting\nGreat like physically like what we experience as a present moment is too yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer\nRight which is ... have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do all of the ... yeah [noise]\nI'm Krista tip and dishes on being today with what his teacher nearby Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with\nMindfulness and contemplative practice [noise] it's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um\nI've had many experiences across the years on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise] even a kind of one off contemplative experience can be\nInstantaneously gratifying right it can be just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that but it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it's just that it's our time yeah [noise]\nAnd I wonder um but I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered\nWe had so much fun last year we are doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be mean Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north happen you're glad rags owners get your tickets today at NPR dot net", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Westfield", "day": "28"}
