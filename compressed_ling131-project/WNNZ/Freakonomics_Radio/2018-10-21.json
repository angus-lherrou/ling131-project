this book was partially funded by a center left think tank called the New America foundation\nThat's since become relevant just because\nThey fired about ... for his critique of Google from the foundation which is noteworthy because the foundation has received a fair amount of money from Google chairman Eric Schmidt\nRight so how much fun as it for you to be publishing a new book and already distancing yourself from the foundation funded the writing of it\nIt it actually does it feel good because New America has been supportive of me over time and I'd rather not seem like a jerk and disavowed them when they've been so nice to me but this does feel like sadly reflective of a much bigger issue who was the critic who was fired\nHis name is ... and he ran something called the open

it was a pro business magazine [noise]\nWe were a magazine that aimed at the people who ran businesses so we had a real inside look at how global as Asian actually works at the institutional level\nThat inside look led to Lynn crossing over to the other side he came to believe that corporations are too powerful and that their power to concentrated this was a theme he pursued in a couple of books and since two thousand two with the New America foundation his project came to be known as the open markets Institute\nGot the work going and we did it or with increasing effect over the last seven years to the point where in twenty sixteen we had a number of folks on the hill starting to understand that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nI Want to actually sort of help shine a light on this problem was a Senator Warren and are the result was a speech that she gave on Capitol Hill\nSenator Elizabeth Warren speech was part of a conference organized by the open markets Institute it was called America's monopoly problem\nToday in America competition is dying\nThis was probably the most important speech about concentration in the United states about the monopoly problem since a series of speeches that FDR gave the Nineteen thirties\nGoogle apple and Amazon provide platform that lots of companies depend on for survival\nBy Google apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with that small companies that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition and she said you know this is\nIt's not just an issue that affects us as consumers it also affects our democracy because it's this concentration of power\nThat leads to concentrations of wealth and concentrations of wealth lead to concentrations of control over government and other institutions of authority\nThis line of criticism would seem to be pretty much in sync with the mission of not only the open market Institute but also its parent organization the New America foundation\nIn my own scholarship I've written about monopolies unrest of consolidation and data ownership\nThat's Anne Marie slaughter the former State Department official in Princeton professor who's now president and CEO of New America\nWhat convinced me to leave Princeton and and the head of New America which was a big move 'cause I had a a wonderful position at at Princeton\nOr was this idea that we really could be a place that hosted fundamental debates about our future and the digital age\nBut as Barry Lynn tells the story New America didn't share his enthusiasm for the conference he put together where Senator Warren spoke\nWell a few people in my organization New America were not happy with the way we're framing the conference and the fact that we were focusing some of our attention on the platform monopolies and especially on Google\nWhat was wrong with focusing on Google in a conference about monopoly after all they do own some Ninety percent of the global search market\nOr I guess the question is if it was um\nWas new or work a new American problematic for Google Google ... of Eric Schmidt who is the now the chair of the board at school was also for a long time on the New America board and then for a period of time served as chair of our board\nEric Schmidt was the chairman of Google and its renamed parent company alphabet for several years she stepped down in early two thousand Eighteen after our interview with Barry Lynn\nFor years Smith was also CEO of Google he's also given New America a lot of money both personally and through his family foundation suited Google itself\nBetween Schmidt and Google New America had received roughly twenty million dollars since its founding in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSo there was a relationship between our two organizations and this was a relationship that goes back to the very early days at New America and actually had never seemed to result in any kind of problems at New America up to this point\nBut now it seems there was a problem we're Schmidt and or Google leaning on New America as ... critique of the company grew more intense a year after the New America conference where Senator Warren spoke against Google domination\nEuropean antitrust regulators hit Google with a huge fine to point seven billion dollars for allegedly tilting search results in its own favor\nNot long after that in June of two thousand Seventeen Barry Lynn posted a statement on the New America website ... congratulated European regulators\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nWe releases statement in support of the decision and Europe and that was on June twenty seventh and on June twenty nine I was told that my entire team had to leave and we had two months to leave\nOne natural conclusion to draw was at Google had stepped in and asked New America to do something about Barry Lynn indeed that's how it was portrayed in New York Times they're headline read Google critic ousted from think tank funded by the tech giant\nAnd at that point I you know ask for this decision to reconsider and and if it could not be reconsidered I asked for more time and I was told that neither of those was possible\nThe writer Franklin for who happens to sit on the board of Barry Lynn's open markets Institute told us similar version of events he made it clear that lens statement about the European regulators decision\nAnd this was something that was a bit too far for Google and numerical was very generous than supporting me and they never did anything to interfere with my own work but I was fairly outraged by the treatment\nOf very and I can't resigned from New America because I'm not affiliated with them and not taking any money from them now but I'm extremely disappointed\nSo first I'd say despite the fact that laws don't require me to be especially trans parents about what the foundation is doing\nI pledge to make completely available to the public all of the grant making we do the evaluations of the grants that we make I Want to invite in outside experts as well\nAnd I would want to find ways in which to organize a foundations efforts to seek out the most severe critics of what we were doing in order to try to learn the most in order to give grants away to greater effect\nAnd uh I'd like to see possibly experimentation with a form of foundation peer review and which you know an effort analogous to what happens in academia happens within the foundation world it would be surprising if the philanthropic evidence of corporations were\nPurely altruistic corporation seek to advance their own interest especially in their lobbying quite

appropriately in the situation or or acts and a very decreased performance\nI've defined choking as worst performance then you'd expect from an individual given that there is a high pressure stakes associated with the situation and that's the on by lock I'm a cognitive scientist and I am president of Barnard College at Columbia University\nBefore coming to Bernard by luck ran the human performance lab at the University of Chicago She also wrote a book called joke\nSo I'm curious to know if you can sort of rank the different domains that people engage in regularly and we're we're

less prone to choke what about high IQ versus low IQ\nIn my research and in others we've shown perhaps counter intuitively that individuals who have the most ability to focus the most working memory that most fluid intelligence or actually more prone to perform poorly under stress and the idea is that\nA few normally devote lots of cognitive resources to what you're doing and being in a pressure

such a strong home field advantage in most for the most plausible explanation is that referees are subconsciously influenced by the home crowd and may make one or two key calls in the home teams favor\nThe research also showed that on balance athletes themselves do not perform better in front of the home crowd and in fact we see on by law tells us that friendly faces may actually create

subtle and hard to measure economists\nLook at choking differently\nSaid that you would have paid me a million dollar ... gave to best interview of the week ... is an economist at the University of California San Diego that would have made me very nervous that would have made me put more effort into this\nWhen we look at the incentives in comics do we think about [noise] two ways in which it's going to to affect us the first is that he felt pay you more you put more effort into task into second assumption is that more effort will lead to better performance and bats\nWe had so much fun last year we are doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that\nMuch to to try so hard that it will actually backfire and you'll be performed worse\nBeen easy co authored one of the foundational economics papers on choking it's called large steaks and big mistakes he and his colleagues ran experiments in a variety of places including India\nThe reason we wanted to go to India is that over there are money can go a long way so we went to some villages in India in which the daily wage was so low that we could offer them up to six months' salary in our experiment because they'd they'd perfectly well\nEach participant completed a series of tasks somewhere creative\nSo dead creative one was for example to back pieces of metal into into books in in an efficient way\nSome tasks for cognitive and memory game in which I Would read up numbers and you listen to me and then at some point do say stop and then you'll have to recall the last three numbers that I mentioned and some tasks were athletic\nThrowing a dark like ... balls so balls on a target and and things like that\nThe payout for successful completion of the task was variable in some cases you get ten cents and others a dollar and others ten dollars\nAnd ten daughter was about what they made in the months over there I open to to agree with me to six months of pays a lot of money that would make you who work much harder riots and the question was are you going to be better actually when you were Carter\nAs can easy noted earlier it's a standard assumption in labor economics the higher pay leads to more effort and more effort leads to better performance or at least higher productivity what happened in this case when the stakes were raised all the way to ten dollars\nSo the findings were striking UC reduction in success rates across the board all six games that we played resulted in lower success rate when the incentives were really high\nFor the three digit memory game roughly forty percent of the participants succeeded under low incentives under high in the Senate and the success rate which is twenty percent\nTo the dark ballgame the success rate under low incentives was ten percent and runs seven percent under high incentives for the middle of packing game\nUnder low incentives twenty five percent of the participants succeeded under high incentives nobody succeeded or put another way at least twenty five percent of them choked\nActually were a bit surprised by this experiment because we included tasks in which we expected that effort will it will increase performance\nBut if you think about it you can see why the researchers maybe shouldn't have been so surprised in these experiments increased effort isn't simply a matter of putting in more time the way you might with an assignment at work or project at school\nIt was trying to execute the same task with and without pressure so can easy and his colleagues wanted to learn more about what sort of tasks make us succumb to pressure\nThey ran some more experiments at MIT using students as their research subjects some experiments involved simple manual tasks like punching alternating keyboard keys as fast as possible\nIt's really something that you know if you do it for long enough it's boring so he felt pay you more you'll try may be harder and we believed it more effort will actually increase your performance\nOther tasks we're more cognitive like adding numbers and major cities\nWhen you think about ... ... probably rich or Baltimore behavior to your best soon and very fast and now I find really really making it high incentives you might actually started being you know distracted\nOnce again there were low end high incentive versions of each task since a dollar doesn't go far in Massachusetts as it doesn't India the rewards here we're up to thirty dollars for the low incentive experiments and up to three hundred dollars for the high\nSo what we found is that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy

dollars they sweet for about two forty percent succeeding to eighty percent succeeding\nOn the other end when you have to end up numbers more coping with the one we see a sharp decrease from sixty five percent to forty percent so when you actually have to put some cognitive effort into this getting the incentive to be ridiculously high could actually be a bad idea\n[noise]\nThis would seem to be pretty good evidence that when activities involves thinking\nWe're more susceptible to choke poor [noise] probably heard from a lot of people over the years coaches teachers and counselors of all sorts of\nYou are capable of doing some amazing things if you can only get your brain out of the way [noise]\nBut that's obviously harder than it sounds so\nHow can you do that how can you prepare yourself to not crumble\nUnder the very circumstances that matter most\nHow do we get people to focus on aspects of their performance that are going to be beneficial for success especially in those situations that are most problematic see on ... again going back to her Gulf experiments\nSo we investigated whether going quicker for example um might help eliminate poor performance under pressure or I'm having one key swing thought that encapsulates your entire stroke\nMight be better um and we showed that some of that was successful and it leads to the opposite idea that um if you really want to mess of your body up on on the back and say hey that was a great shot what were you doing with your elbow\n[laughter] All right great said so you're helping us make people took more but [laughter] what else can you tell us about in this domain at least I'm learning to joke with\nWe also showed that getting used to this type of hyper attention to detail that sometimes comes sweats performance can be helpful so\nReally inoculate in yourself against the high pressure situation you see this with students who practiced taking time pass a\nUC Davis with military pilots and firefighters and people who practice under some of the types of conditions are going to perform under and you even see this if you walk by a college football stadium friday afternoon the music blaring getting the players used to what it's going to feel like to be in that big stadium um\nAnd this is true in\nReally big important situations but it's it's also true in this little things we do every day so if you're going to give a toast at a wedding I'm practicing doing it while people are watching you know um and if no one is willing to watch you videotape yourself anything that gets you used to the
