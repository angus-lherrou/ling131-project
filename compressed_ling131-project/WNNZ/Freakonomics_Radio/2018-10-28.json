S. but\nYou're talking about the largest economy in the world so it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with our actions taken by the United states also because an accident that it's taken by the United states has repercussions\nAre everywhere are across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect so of course a lot of my time has to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from disguising the ambient that was a a north gripe and then found a direction that didn't ... that was not there he is the result of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and uh if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis\nAnd I have to tell you there's a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO is opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that tariffs are a really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U. S. is the biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their governments that subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nTo use the WTO have any ability to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence B\nWe're so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done that\nFor the by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what\nWe call behind the border protection\nA and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient or enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because tariffs you can measure\nThe Arabs you include only a spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost a behind the board there measure you don't know when they come you don't know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. job would discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nThan not really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are are put in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer\nTo explain to them what was going on that this was not the case now ah talked to him I talked to a prime minister may I I'm going to be next month in um in Germany or to talk with a\nA Chancellor Merkel I recently was in Japan or talk to reminisce or I'd be I'm a I've\nBeen covering a lot of ground and we've been talking and they're all concerned [noise]\nThere is a recent news that are the leaders of\nRussia and China have gotten together and boosted their newfound strategic a partnership I'm curious how you think about um [noise]\nYou know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all\nBut when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists and other countries respond by making their own deals I'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of\nThe WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\n[laughter] to be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly\nWe have so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done that\nAlso have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to see a conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course it can share with you and the listeners or the content of ... but um they are very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system\nAnd I would say that pretty much everybody I've talked to a tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know doing the line when others are\nComing up after the break room with the head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask\nHim to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nBut don't worry Roberto as a veto has plenty more to say it will cure it after the break [noise]\nFreakonomics radio is supported by target presenting feature at heart and new podcast that explores the work and change makers across the country and highlights projects in cities like Miami Washington DC and New York city feature at heart of al blind apple pie cats or wherever podcaster found\nFreakonomics radio is supported by progressive insurance offering snapshot device designed to reward safe drivers learn or at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nKeeping up with the news these days can be like drinking water out of a fire hose coming at you all day long on line over the air you're on the street\nMichel Martin we can hope that all things considered we're here to help you figure it out what matters bones and how it affects you join us every Saturday and Sunday for all things considered from NPR News\nThat says evening at five o'clock [noise]\nThe many news network is funded by you and C.

and being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian\nUm well the good thing about being\nA Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspect of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry\nStraining of New

was\nUntil I met my wife ah and ah she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined the diplomatic career I think that was a\nLove story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering like solution to a trade or economic problem\nAnd so and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that forever learning how to re ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there's an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism and globalism and so I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed\nCountries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with other partners they essentially gain from that but it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors\nIn the domestic economy will lose many gain a many are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they are not competitive enough sometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different\nFrom this very traditional very a historic attention today we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human\nInput as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies it's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course but the minor\nIn this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric so it's easy to think of what the wrong\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal

governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith\nA you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or for I'm an active a visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the state was involved in almost everything in Silicon valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public actress played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like DARPA a NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA but also sister organization in more recent times called aren't they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nOn search in high risk a research\nThere's some evidence of the government funding that ... was talking about DARPA for the defense advanced
