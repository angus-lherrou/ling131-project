surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get it how much of that ability where they born\nHow much is attributable to hard work and practice this is a debate that's been going on probably forever nature versus nurture\nRaw talent versus what's called deliberate practice we've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great at just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious fact become great at anything\nNeed both talented in practice lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success in life Bernie failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels and identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe\nReal life is more nuanced than that\nAlso more interesting\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is I multiply multimillionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men\nMust sell drugs when their kids and um and have only their mother and grow up in a Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York I mean she had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of law like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I can go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThat should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems\nCrazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYou are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best kid on your team\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools MSA in creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nOh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future athletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son\nThat boy is about a hundred times more likely than a random boy to also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals and be trolley ball\nOh man well my my life is literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar athletes they both come from very athletic family my parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is ship friend who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is ... extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery then hand surgeries and neck surgeries and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nUm had played more different sports when they were younger spent more time in self structured or unstructured soccer play when they were younger but not more time in deliberately structured soccer training\nOnly by age twenty two did they start playing fewer sports in spending more time and structured soccer than athletes who put into the lower levels so this sort of less structured development\nUm turns out to be completely characteristic of athletes go on to become [noise]\nWhat if you are a young athlete or the parent of one\nAnd your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athletes but rather to get into ... university like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that to exact problem that Steve Love it my freakonomics friend and coauthor he's an economist at the University of Chicago but my calculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids\nWill make it to one of those top ten schools so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I catch that thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools MSA in creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nThat you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave a fencing thing the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nAnd each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill\nThere's three different blade says eBay there's Sabre list foil and there's a male female fancy and\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious he Spencers so it's something like six or seven percent of the kids you ever tried to be sensors ended up being college fence or so about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent base fine\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts been something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to the ivy league school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be called soccer players\nBut the the chance of having soccer ... vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or eighty times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old and\nHe fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know is grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio\nThe story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played\nAt Kentucky or do you would have been a time

R. dot net thank you very much\nI I didn't really have a good answer for them at the time I just thought this is something that I Want to do and I want to be really good at good at it while I Do it and so I Need to make the sacrifices now so I can have a good performance later\nIn high school you know by the time I was a sophomore and I knew I had a chance I started preparing the former baseball all star mark to share a\nWhy didn't go to my high school a homecoming for three straight years because I was playing football baseball you know I didn't I didn't do a lot of stuff in the summertime like Seventy games every summer my friends are going to concerts my friends or you know having a good time at the beach and all these kinds of things\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably in high school is when I started to uh forego other\nOpportunities that again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nThen in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at the University of Maryland and my academic advisor was I can do that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make a chart practices\nTheir labs and blah blah blah blah so I was like no\nNot going to do that so instead you did was it American studies at American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter] no I um\nI enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay all that to say once I got to the league then I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency is final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects of his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid out a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me close to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and [noise]\nAnd then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farm

creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications that they pass dot edu\nBut don't make the big time just look at the numbers there are only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball for a few of the nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred\nIn baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just in Humphries\nYou get a phone call says how does it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get it 'cause it's a dream come true so I ended up signing\nHe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on in two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I'd seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball\nGuys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home and I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's a but you know it's ten years\nAnd that is Sudhir Venkatesh\nAnd so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks I think one of the most curious things that we find is how much ten years matter so if you take two people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one didn't\nThe person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game then the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking\nThe average player probably looks like an upper middle class kitten who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably gonna make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they're going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid\nThat kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year\nWhich is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWell when you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than two thousand dollars a month\nLiving off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that\nAt some point you have to say look I've got a with no degree I had a lesson associates degree at that point so at some point you tell yourself I Can't do this to myself I Can't do this to my parents and I can't continue when I Know there's ... untapped potential to do other
