[noise]\n\nYou happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project I'm Dan doctor often don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name\nBut his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nYou grew up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but he settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven along the way\nI came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAnd the eventual you that that idea became a bit of a movement or it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg who at the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal\nSmart self made fiercely pragmatic and he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about he was the opposite of a career politician and then the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack\nLess than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred an eighth mayor now Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other neophyte to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDamn doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nWhen Bloomberg was finally done being mayor into thousands Thirteen after squeezing out a third term despite a pre existing two term limit he considered running for president he considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and do all of a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today as CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back of the day before the end Dr off was unknown [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... the first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed he wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed\nAnd then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it [noise]\nI wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always\nSo here's the hit to any of your is offering a special sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets now at your net [noise]\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they used the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of reasonable benefit from it all\nDepends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time et cetera et cetera\nYou join us every Saturday and Sunday for all things considered from NPR News\nThat's just evening at five

through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nCover from the nine eleven attack who then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today\nOne of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off chairman president\nShed I'm just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back to when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea and the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards\nWe wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem\nThat let us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer something yes\nThat's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years the Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather the sheds seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ism of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of a big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline\nI mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change I think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who are obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble is the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of less than that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay pest dot edu\nOne court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who owned land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what\nThe two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because the government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we are competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system\nAnd basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been the bride companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interests over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for papal from all over the world you know it's sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYou know you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently\nStreaming of New England
