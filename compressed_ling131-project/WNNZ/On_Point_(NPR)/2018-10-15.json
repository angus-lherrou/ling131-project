Steve thank you so much for your call a enough Taliban David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nWhat I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to\nPraise and it probably was suggesting that I'm mad as has somewhat more you know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term and the president doesn't certain things in that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nA matter of who's going to stay that long after the midterms midterms are traditionally a time when a lot of cabinet\nMembers may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list\nUm I think it's a little early to know where he would go for replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world I think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time at least that I knew if that if there had been that clear of a signal from the White House\nBut the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had to ask the caller about ... what he thought of\nA ... when the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies that the president does say things that that we can prove that have no\nUh no no evidence behind them and I know in I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have our potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response\nTo that for people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at last week I think our time runs together with a with a with a President Trump but the people at these rallies and they were so energized they were\n... they are you know they are true believers\nSo I don't know whether they take everything that Trump said that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes\nBut they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people outside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they they're not thousands of people outside\nBut he says these things\nI Am but I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like him are that are entertained by the things that he said and that that's the core things that he says resonates with them for a swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump is in these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kinda have to start from a place of if you already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith says the same question to you as as Asia that it seems as if it's\nThe the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says ... things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nIf anybody can find these swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture\nTake some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue in cheek we spend some time to take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea\nOr no he doesn't literally think Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just enormous crowds don't quite take literally like we do have\nHad our caller who said that everything the president said\n[noise] [noise]\nThe ... or news network is funded by you and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts helping

political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well as an editor at the wall Street Journal Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX says the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho denied climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nAh Lesley Stahl open with hurricane Michael and asked the president if he's still things climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions intrusions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current in climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated just your your thoughts on hearing that clip from the president\n... it was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking\nUh the the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time\nPresident Trump wasn't giving interviews he's giving now so this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president\nAnd he basically repeating even though he's not he said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida and Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a color here Beth calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi ah I'm just curious that luckier Adams perspective\nOn the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because here you have Trump coming and um and the sort of control the purse strings Trump and Scott the Republican versus Gillum that Democrat and happening backyard pretty much so I'd love to hear your thoughts on\nThat best thank you for your call Adam go ahead well\nIf I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a\nIn ... in Tallahassee and look what he's involved you've got candidates like Rhonda sand just the fellow who's running for governor who is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears\nBut that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about uh the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as the as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal a ... and the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened to ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nState Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminded me a little bit of some of his comments about\nA president putting you know he says that ah they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors uh in in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on bad I don't have other yeah in a base and you know I don't think a lot of other people suggesting it could be route killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it and the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling her arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and his ... talked about how much he he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump patio and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it's just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they're an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials relate relations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force\nIn the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a\nPersonal relationship with leaders that's how he describes it he'll he'll say whether he means it literally or not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have chemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia and ... have been some you know and be asked is people call him\nYou know had a very strong affected not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in\nAs well or enough probably since you mentioned that moment on sixty minutes interview let's hear it uh this is when the president told\nLeslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government uh did indeed assassinate ... but then as now Taliban David points out President Trump also said he didn't want to lose big arms contracts\nThey order a military weapons everybody in the world one in that order Russia wanted it China wanted it we wanted it we got it so would you cut that off like well what I don't want to do blowing Lockheed Raytheon all these ... I don't want to\nHurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of a\nHighly shift to use the word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nThat is the president speaking to Leslie stall and sixty minutes this weekend let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado Jose you're on the air\nOh recruited my shirt or a question or comment a\nFirst of all I Love your last name is ...\nUm\nQuestion I'm\nOnly of Saudi Arabia predicament desert from four credits over just for the board of military contracts or do you feel comfortable and measure approach to the\n... well I Hope that we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\nYou know wondering what your journal for the great well let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her thought ice you what do you\nThink these these military contracts with Saudi Arabia", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "15"}
