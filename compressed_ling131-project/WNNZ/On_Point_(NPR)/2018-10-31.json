N. I. nine Ninety eight nine Adams WBAI see Ninety One Ninety Springfield and W. A. M. H. eighty nine three immersed in partnership with Amherst College and UMass Amherst it's eight o'clock\n\n[noise] from WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line on news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday was the latest developments analysis and your calls our question tonight is especially intriguing and we'll get to that and just a few minutes\nWith election day exactly one week away there's a lot of campaign news to cover let's start with the United States Constitution\nThe fourteenth amendment to be specific last night in an interview with Jonathan swam from ... President Trump said he would sign an executive order to end what's known as birthright citizenship which gives every person\nBorn in the United states automatic citizenship\nSome legal scholars believe he can get rid of the practice and shit without changing the constitution way to get water\nOr have you thought about that is telling all it was always told me that you needed constitutional a member guessing lemon but you don't need a number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to do well and you can definitely do with it an act of Congress now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nJoining me to talk about the legal aspect of this is WNYC legal affairs correspondent Jamie Floyd Jamie welcome to welcome back to America on the line okay Jamie you're a legal expert\nIs what the president proposes even legal or constitutional\nWell uh I have my pocket constitutions in your way writers certainly wish the president would open has so let's just simply read the constitution and we only need to read the fourteenth amendment section one and Jonathan don't worry it'll take\nJust one second to read the relevant portion it's very explicit it's the citizenship clause in the very first words if the fourteenth amendment\nRatified right after the civil war all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where and they were side so what does that mean Jonathan it is simple\nChildren born in the U.S automatically become citizens of the U.S and so any executive order to change that\nWould lead to an immediate constitutional debate over the fourteenth amendment and I've been thinking about this all day Jonathan I and my view and and the view it seems a of a broad swath of analyst and scholars today is that the fourteenth amendment citizenship guarantee it's clear\nAnd that the president cannot erase it or really any other part of the constitution with an executive order that's\nThe very foundation of our constitutional form of government\nJamie Kennedy just provide some context why was the fourteenth amendment even necessary why was that clause\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nPurpose of this clause was to overrule the now infamous Dred Scott decision of the U.S Supreme Court which was handed down in Eighteen fifty seven and that said John uh than\nThat as you and I know perhaps Donald Trump does not know this part of our history but it said that black slaves were property and that we were specifically Jonathan not\nCitizens and plus the decision also said that Congress and the states could not grant citizenship to the descendants of slaves including the children of freed slaves\nThey were not us citizens either and so this is why what has happened today is still a painful\nOr eighties rooted in the ugly history of this country and the Dred Scott ruling was specifically normal side in sixteen fifty eight when the U.S ratified the fourteenth amendment which is essentially gave blacks\nThe right to US citizenship and all persons born on this soil\nI won't even ask you a question about just let's say he was the president was able to actually do this the logistical nightmare of of enforcing that I mean what he's proposing in the end is just kabuki theater ... and this is going nowhere\nThe politics of citizenship goes back a century or more citizenship it's been a contested political issue\nSince reconstruction uh and and the president understands that you're asking me the legal part of this I can dive into the political if you want to do that now I you know coming today a days before the election it sounds more like a political stunt than any sort of reasoned argument\nBut given the ugly history um the I I think we have to think both about the legal kabuki theater as you\nA college and the political implications of what he's trying to do and you as you recall Jonathan uh he he brought this up once before and two in two thousand six election that was all this talk about the executive order\nA ... around the citizenship question and then nothing came of it until when today he brings it up again\nA and there's an expectation that after the midterm elections it will it will disappear ... right well I have you here real quickly and um forgive me if I neglected to even bring this up as as a topic but I'm the president also an announced\nYesterday that he wants to send fifty two hundred troops to the\nBorder to help block migrants making slowly making their way up from Central America and that last um read out they were over a thousand miles away from the U.S border with Mexico just legal migrants right the migrants\nLegally speaking what can troops do in the military do in terms of enforcing the law on the border\nRight well there he this has come up before with President Trump\nA and watch authorities he has to give orders a visa the the us border uh and the military and which are aspects of our\nAh for the U.S military forces border patrol et cetera should be monitoring the border\nBy the way before the migrants have even approached the border\nAre so eats it's terribly complicated and again\nDays before the election so let's have this conversation shall we after the election and see whether he's still talking about sending anyone to the border beyond the folks who are they are monitoring the border and part of their daily job already okay so Jayme taxpayer\nDollars herself on the show eight days are now

to be on okay I I Want to since I was talking with Jamie about um\nI Am this executive order on the fourteenth amendment like let's just have to have had this discussion before we we turned to Pittsburgh Brian sincere here um your your reactions to this\nWell there's a lot to say and Jamie shed a lot of what needs to be said one\nOther thing is that there is a cause of the constitution as it relates to immigrants was actually tested\nIn the U.S Supreme Court a few decades later when\nChinese immigrants exclusion was all the rage in the United states like Latino in Muslim exclusion is now in certain circles and there was a Chinese American born in this country name long Kim Clarke\nWho left the country and to test\nWhether this applied to immigrants um he was detained outside of San Francisco and he tried to come back\nThe only thing I could say as a matter of comment about that is that maybe the president and once again sets the tone because he manages to promote his golf courses wherever he goes in hotels and\nI Love the Saturdays 'cause they buy ally apartments so you know maybe think he looks around and says well I guess this is okay these days but I don't really know that that's happening\nAnd max is it possible that ... let's say a week from tonight Democrats do take back the house and get and get all sorts of subpoena power that they will use that power to hold more people within the administration accountable in the way the deejay appears to be doing\nAbsolutely they need to do that there are a ton of scandals this is the least ethical administration in us history and there's a lot of things that need to be investigated that the Republican Congress has been eager to sweep under the carpet and a Democratic House has an obligation to use their subpoena power to get to the bottom of some of these scandals\nAlright max thank you very much Brian and max will be back later in the show when we return we'll take your calls on this question how

value of democracy less than we used to what a lot of us be okay with a leader who wasn't required to work with Congress\nThe answer is yes according to the world values survey which measures attitudes about democracy and with that in mind that's our question for you tonight how do you feel about democracy is our system of government working for you or could you imagine living under a different system\nAnd authoritarian system military leadership\nCall us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five that eight four four seven four or five talk\nOur colleagues at radiolab are doing a special episode on democracy time to election day reporter let of Nasser joins us from Los Angeles to tell us more about how liberal democracy is regarded by its citizens\nWelcome to hang our underlining letter thank you very much All right so this ... this is fascinating and so you're you're ... episode starts off with something called as I mentioned before the world values survey\nAnd ... um the Lucy where is that first question the first question in the survey is this how do you feel about having a strong ruler who doesn't have to bother with Congress or election what did people say in response to that\nYeah well so so the the the person the researcher who who sort of flying this for us a is a political scientist Josh a monk at Harvard and and he was comparing way that people were answering these questions Americans were answering these questions\nAre back in the nineties and then in the latest version of the survey and to the question or would you say that having a strong leader who does not have to bother with Congress in elections is a good way of governing the country I'm\nUh in Nineteen Ninety five about twenty four percent of Americans endorsed this idea of the strongman leader in the latest survey thirty two percent that ...\nThat would that's incredible go ahead go ahead yeah which is really ... which is really surprising like a a I think for yeah for for\nFor someone like me like coming from an immigrant family like the the the thing that you know the value in democracy so much to hear that there is this just widespread discontent in this country that it's a that even you know as a strongman leader that doesn't have to bother with Congress that's a very anti democratic\nIdeal that that you know might be appealing to to that many people so\nThe second question was how important is it for you to live in a democracy on a scale\nOf one to ten right and so uh and so in that question about two thirds of older Americans which is to say those America's born in the thirties or forties would give the highest response of very very important to live in a democracy you know the top the numbers um but left\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nOr yeah for younger people it's not quite as important to live in a democracy\nOK so before I get to the third question let's dive into this a little bit deeper ... is the millennial response is fascinating and is that because of a a lack of trust in institutions and ... and if so what is driving that do you think\nThere's a few there's a few reasons especially that this researcher Yasser monk opposes one is just a economically standards of living have sort of stagnated so younger people see you know the success that their parents had that they don't see that themselves having that same success nurse feeling\nA a a little unhappy about it another possibility is that you know you have older generations who remember a World War two I remember the Cold War or\nThey feel like they have something to compare it to they they knew that uh you know what uh Germany or the you know what fascism was like they know what I'm what Soviet communism was like an and they can say oh at least our democracy is not is not as bad as that\nWhereas now for millennials who you know have come of age a post Cold War uh there's really nothing else to compare it to and so you look at the system and it's just sort of dysfunctional and you think oh this this sucks\n[laughter] and the third the third question is do you think army rule is a good system of government how did people respond to that\nYes it is it's it's it's a very surprising thing so their share of us citizens who thinks that it would be a good or very good thing for the army to rule so in Nineteen Ninety five just one in sixteen respondents agreed with that and then the last time this survey was done a one in six agreed\nWhat rationed what's behind that yeah no and it well and and just to make it even more of like saying ... among among young affluent Americans one in three agreed that army rule would be good or very good\nWow I'm\nI asked I asked that last question to get the army I'm military rule question out of the way because Allen\nIs called in from Brooklyn odds to answer our questions about how do you feel about ... is our system of government working for you um could you imagine living under a different system Alan what say you\nKnow the day\nI realized that we're not a democracy would be the day\nIt's not the night before that I Would leave um other than fighting for the democracy um I'm a son of a Jewish immigrants from ... who left in I'm In the light of not the Nazi taking Baron Germany some\nYears later after the war and you know uh well during the Cold War when I went to visit his town in Poland and just returning going from\nEast Germany to West Germany I was put in prison because of my papers warrant in order a they had forgotten to give me what they called the transit visa and just being in a place where you know you realize you have no record\n'em the earth you know there is no opportunity to exercise freedom of speech issue too it's either repressed or it's meaningless and then years later I worked as a journalist\nIn uh in Chechnya where the people who are you know oppose Russia were just literally obliterated a civilian city civilian\nCity which were they called the worst found a lot of the word bombing things or the bombing of Dresden was elated by putting\nSo there you go you know the alley that what you get when you don't have choice\nI was about to ask you you have a band to places where democracy is in short supply if you know not exist in if you as\nA lot of just pointed out your millennials are are are down under ...\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your tickets today at NPR done\nAnd push it off by five years and then the voters they had this thing called the people's of each other they just voted for it again and so now they're going for it so now they're doing it and it's a it's a really exciting because it's the first time that this system\nIs being used for for a national level race\nOr so it's kind of a kind of a great experiment and we'll see what happens next week\nWe'll write in exactly seven days lead of Nasser thanks so much for being on America on the line thanks so much revenue and time for a break when we come back we'll

evening on state races\nOne lesson Democrats hope there's science has learned is that state elections matter a lot in their everyday lives so we'll talk of the blue wave that puts the house is getting a lot of attention a wave that washes over state houses will have a direct impact on voters\nSo will there be a wave red or blue in the states this year joining us now to talk about the state of the states is Lou Jacobson senior author of the almanac of American politics and the politics columnist for governing magazine Lou welcome to America on the line\nI thanks for having me okay so for those who are not up on their civics lesson in why why are these elections just as important if not maybe even more important than the blue wave of the house or the house elections in everyone's paying attention to\nYeah sure well I'm certainly state governments have taken a pretty aggressive role in shaping policy um over the past decade or two I'm so obviously you know a lot of important stuff happens I think rational level the national level\nBut there's a lot that goes all the state level that is really important to 'em and uh uh this is really the big year out of the four year sort of recurring cycle on\n'em because there are a total of ah thirty I'm Sorry uh thirty six seats I Believe are up and yet a third thirty six are being contested which is the biggest of any uh of that that four year period\nAnd when you say thirty six seizures name at governorships\nGovernorships ... thank you going I'm and I'm\nSo I'm so based on reporting that I've done um I read um\nTwenty thirty six races that are going on this fall\nI'm In for the governor seats as being competitive and that means either a toss up or it leans democratic ... ... and what is interesting uh I'm even kind of separate from the political\nWins um uh where you have the Democrats feeling pretty good about their chances in general that's the topic of the political environment\nUm uh it's almost more of a structural\nIssue for the governorships of those twenty competitive\nA governorships um fourteen are held by the geo pay a whole bunch of those were actually open seats um and those are the sorts of seats which can\nCan can flip 'em so uh if you take take the big picture for the governors'\nSeats um I Would expect um a a a net change in the Democrats' direction between three and tenth seats um if it gets to be tendencies and if a ... sort of on the outer edge of what's possible\nUm that would actually be enough to flip a control quote unquote of the uh of of the governors' seats I'm from the G O P which currently has um [noise] uh thirty a a thirty three seats\nAmateur chef is thirty two Democratic at you I'm a just in the course of one one cycle [noise]\nWhy I Am I'm Glad you brought that up because I was going to ask you a thirty six governorship how many are controlled by Republicans and how many are controlled by a by Democrats and in terms of state legislatures do you have ... ... ... at your fingertips\nHow many state ... state legislatures both houses leaving out Nebraska rescue unit camera system but um how many feet lead legislatures are completely in the hands of the Republican Party are completely in the hands of the Democratic party\nThat's a great question actually come back to that because we\nBuy I Do know ... generally that that the ... has a lot more they are called ... effective right I'm a than the Democrats too and I should say that um [noise] that ah there's a pattern it's a long term historical pattern that I'm a bit of a party\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield in children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nTalking about um they are bound to lose government governorships and also state legislature control it's just a natural sort of balancing kind of\nA act by the voters I'm a a typically especially in these big mid term elections when so many governors' seats are up I'm a mid term elections are really bad historically for the party in power and the White House\nAnd there is a sort of a bleed down effect where a voter is take out their sort of aggressions on the part of controlling the White House in some of the state races and so it's very common\nLike you know in the Obama years the Democrats did terribly in terms of governor's race in state legislatures and um now what we're seeing this is the first midterm under Trump [noise] um and ah if things go as as a seems seems seems to be expected\nSeven Democrats should gain the question is uh\nIs the degree of that game all of the just a small number of seats or will it be a larger number\nIn and I was asking the question about state legislatures and pushing on the number of governorship governorships because we had former attorney general Eric Holder on the show or a little while back in right now he's ... he's the chairman of the national\nDemocratic redistricting committee\nAnd they've been very focused on state legislatures and governors ships because\nI'm mildly election is twenty Eighteen they're focused on the redistricting effort and that happens after this after the twenty twenty cents is and how that plays a part\nIn redrawing congressional districts and the party in power in the governor's mansion and in the state legislatures are the ones who control\nHow those districts are drawn to that's why these seat raises are also very embarrassing very ... like hey\nI'm a uh the the cycle that we're in right now which are the the uh the uh twenty Eighteen cycle go back ... I'm a total of eight years and then even before that sixteen years ago a lot of the the sort of ground level\nUm structural issues for for the Republicans actually something back\nReally as far as two thousand two it's sort of weird so in two thousand two came in the recession and voters in a really large number of states throughout the incumbents because they were say physical crises and they were very dissatisfied with their state government um and\nUh it was a strange pattern blue states when red and red states went blue\nThose governors who are less than two thousand two for the most part served eight years two terms they were out and twenty ten and twenty ten huge GOP wave here [noise] so you had a lot of states I'm ah in twenty ten sort of purple states maybe even bluer states um ah\n\nFootball is a big part of Texas and culture and players protesting police brutality during the national anthem has caused a big debate the issue with the new and yes that is disrespectful for those men and women and I have an\nIssue with them taking them ie the knee is submissive he should stand with his fist in there\nA national debate comes home to Texas tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nThe second hour of on point is next\nThis will be any PR news network WINZ am six forty Westfield W.

the totally ... are a lot of kids to be one hundred percent self directed in what they learn and\nHow they learn it and I'm joined today by movie could dig she's a mother who are in schools or eleven and Thirteen year old daughter she's founder of eclectic learning network and she's joining us today from Philadelphia also with us is Peter gray he is a professor of psychology at Boston College co founder\nAnd president of the nonprofit alliance for self directed education and the author of free to learn\nA no Peter great I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps ... success is based on how self directed a child is\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they won all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\nRight [noise] well you know\nThe kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter] so this issue of self directed what is it being to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever see the little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there what's new what can I learn about [noise]\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch [noise]\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them\nSo on schooling is this what if we just let them continue to do that instead of putting them away where their own questions don't count anymore where their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school or what kind of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we found them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because\nWe've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity\nPlayfulness so they have the ability to something\nHere for a second I I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some I don't know some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a missile quote okay I tried to get some to change that and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete myth quote one of my own research has shown that children learn to read\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nWays at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of ... and uh I have yet to see a child who's been self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read a very different ages right\nWell here's why I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them\nOr it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't we can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like\nCivics or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh you know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of sending them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning a car they learning it in a way that is meaningful to them that stays with them so let's take civics for example\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics is that a real civics lesson or is it better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lesson than a lecture on it you are living it you are limited in\nWhat in what though that that you'll have ultimate the total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nYou know something yes we do have to live in this society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society\nThey are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody is totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or ... years learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratically there are lots of rules you can't literally you care if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules\nAnd isn't that a better civics lesson\nMovie could have you been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell I'm from me I I question what the word introduced me and in this context because introducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that\nAnd for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so the idea that these things will not be\nIntroduced or seen or felt as something that\nI don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAt its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready\nAnd whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happened at a playground mhm there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that it's not something that is specific to going to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and said that the university graduate schools MS in higher education

you like to respond to that\nI mean caffeine and that's that's her position and I totally respect that\nUm for me I see it differently and that's that's what makes us all unique and the biggest the biggest thing about this about exploring what learning is is the liberation of being indoctrinated into a system that wasn't built for a person like myself\nIt was not built for me to truly explore and be innovative and look at this as an opportunity to really shine and that's what I'm allowing my children to do whether it has\nAn effect that may be viewed as negative for not that you know how anyone feels there's none of my business is pretty much the model I follow so as much as I appreciate her perspective [noise] um [noise]\nThat's that's what works for us and my children are learning

what sort of things should I look for my child to see if he's a good candidate for this type of war lean at what age did it again and what sort of parameters or\nBoundaries are needed if we go into the sort of um in educational\nProcess\nSteven first of all I'm going to tell you there is no such thing on this program as overly simplistic question especially when we're talking about education so I actually thank you very much for your call Peter gray do you have some answers ...\nThe question well Wendy began begins at birth [laughter] you you can't stop it from beginning at birth children are beginning to self educated as soon as they're more they're learning constantly they're constantly learning\nSo one of the questions that I've been interested in my own research is there are there are some children who are\nMore cut out for self directed education than for others and this is many people think well some people are sort of self motivated they can take control of their own life and so on\nMy experience has been a little little children are all self motivated and that doesn't end if we allow it to continue it does not end if we allow it to continue I think the I think the important thing to ask for anybody who wants to take this route is\nAm I capable of trusting my child am I capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control [noise] now the truth of the matter really\nTerror and my heart and let her as there is just going\nTo give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research that just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout almost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had [noise]\nAnd so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it and less we lock them away in closets and so on [noise] but here's what we have to understand we are now living in the world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly\nHey for more content from New England Public radio ... dot net last

is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows is that the graduate so self directed education are doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting\nJobs let me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nWell first I'd appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask one of the characteristics of the children but if the parents do we really want a society\nIn which we are the children are simply the property of their parents when there's a growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti of you know clearly racist kinds of things\nAnd I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best\nFor their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now\nAnd ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing the situations that are that we're putting parents and so that's my first my first response the second is um we have to ask\nDo we want a simply to have a society in which her children are simply see\nParents having no responsibility whatsoever to the larger society what can we do to make it more certain that the vast majority of children who will go to public schools actually get the kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie and Peter one\nWell Michael let me let the Peter Graham illegal responded that Peter go ahead\nI I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and that's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to let me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problems\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and it works very well for their children\nBut I don't think is real solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not

security reporter for the Texas Tribune\nAnd it's got lots of listeners comment coming ... here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people and type in Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones\nAnd then mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I just want to say that I Am totally in favor of trips to the border I think we need to protect our borders I\nThink President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's that people are getting somewhere they have water bottle so they have money [noise] something sponsoring this and we need to protect America [noise]\nNot that I Believe in voter ID I hadn't even get one to get a very [noise]\nIdentification alone to open a credit card to get a library card just starting to kill it is there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it why can't they\n\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call their uh Allen do is I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concerns the issues are concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea is one violence at that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this care of it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they travel encourage ranch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm solely for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them in the last ... curve and that got here I think provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them\nDid exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and for more reporters that we have embedded with the care of and moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here that it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee so it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be far fewer people than not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or to take over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm Alan a little early in the show and then just clarify here ... aren't isn't the Trump Administration also seeking just merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat his uh in the ... the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering um is that they were planning to Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and some of the other\nUh tragedies we've seen recently um but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban\nUm shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of the travel ban worship down by the courts but the third one survived and so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply\nDreaming of New England public radio is funded by you Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield in children's well community grown and community owns since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd see that as a threat to national security and the the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second he when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could grow out here\nRight now oh you know you're there you know when I was going to be talked about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh we between intimate representative\nA Republican we'll heard Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because they did that district that heard represents has many hundreds of miles on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a far east Paso county\nUh all the way to uh to the outskirts of ... county um which is includes San Antonio and big band and several border counties in between the you know this for this this was considered a closer it's a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um\nComments on her it is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable at five to say that then is um Ortiz Jones has imposed a significant challenge\nAnd could still you know that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving a the Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but\nUm but congressman heard also you know it was very public about his his the way he strives for bipartisanship um you know he and and ... actually they you know they did that Facebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to to the sea and they they ended up doing the Facebook Live of their journey which\nI think when I'm ... pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress for him to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas you know they're concerned about the wall and eminent domain and issues like border security but they are also um by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they think is an action you know you talk to [noise]\nTo ranchers along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going to their property and that's how they say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman heard in the minds of of his constituents has done a pretty good job of of trying to strike a middle down he's been a somewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but\nCloser to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more toward the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the to the extreme and um and to Mr to Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect that we don't know how many people are going to end up coming here and what I saw on the Brits and she was on Tuesday was migrants that were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so with respect to the caller's concerns in illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when a lot of people are definitely do\nYou know the the herd Jones interesting to me because it will hurt the I think he he represents as you were saying earlier how um the views of communities on the border are much more they're more subtle and texture\nThan we might see a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border 'cause I Know hurting the eloquent hum advocate for more smart ... technology versus hard wall technology between the United states and Mexico but we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking the call um I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense um and to play defense against emotional appeals and instead focus
