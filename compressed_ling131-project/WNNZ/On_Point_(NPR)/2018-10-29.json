Pittsburgh\nA was really ... renting and railing about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about a ... his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest right that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading organization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees and talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so Howard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell ah this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically grew up [noise]\nIf you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of

Charleston\nWere quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in a church\nI'm fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and an anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I look at it uh over the course of history\nAh conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a convenient and deadly a answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and in an angry\nAt the system uh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years and here in America it as part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing a religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia and and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the\nSome of the language that uh that Democrats have used to\nHave to lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here or there are a lot of reasons for it\nStreaming of New England public radio is

not quite human is is an other with a capital oh that is dangerous and in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone

communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically and and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing

things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law itself is getting into his daughter and son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three wives and somebody on Twitter rate [laughter] the dean of it that he somehow you know dissolved of his white supremacist stoking of his blaming the [laughter] the caravan\nOn Soros of his constant attacks on SARS calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally um that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughters decisions not resonate with me\nThe idea that George Soros is somehow this um [noise] you know is involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS himself\nAddressed it in an interview it's not even a fourteen year old in Hungary ah when the Nazis were there\nUm\nAnd yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among us the vulnerable I commend the thirty six times more than any other myths but in the Torah\nTo protect the stranger because we were ...\nConfidence and the the immigrant among us and I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are just part of a larger ... right\nYeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely want to return the ... but I also just wanted to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because\nI I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront head on this ecosystem that as being\nUm if not burdened at least a [noise] I don't I don't know legitimize or not to tamp down by\nA Republican leadership in America right now can speak to them because I've been covering them for years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo our or to to to take it through through the odds of showroom for caring for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews over her\nIs orderly wrong and here's the reason for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only President Bush but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he is taken every shred\nOf discord cynicism hatred in fear that has always been resident in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about the Native Americans ... he's he's gathered every one of ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional

just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is\nThat he rose to power on fear the rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on\nUnbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power and that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country\nAnd that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he's weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that we're in\nRight I mean so she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet morning\nAh that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quit buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August after\nVisiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anything immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the party where in America pushing the platform they pushed they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh silly all of these I should say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things\nTogether to me seems to be I don't know it it it just you know political cynicism using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief\nBut that this is this an ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be and how come of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case uh Howard let me just turn back to you on the what do we do about it I mean we even have\nLou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYeah I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership is voting as David Was saying uh we uh people have to get out in uh in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual says to be invaded by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradox school system here in the sense that it's of the people by the people for the people\nAre as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character and and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody ah from people who come forward as leaders to to explain\nThat America is a community and uh we're individuals and we prize individual ism in America but we're also community and we can't operate without that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "29"}
