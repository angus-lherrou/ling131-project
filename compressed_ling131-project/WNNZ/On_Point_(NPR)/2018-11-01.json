T. L. so about that nightmare scenario I mentioned earlier\nNow what if the election really isn't over next Tuesday night what if there\nAre so many disputed results ballot challenges runoffs and slow vote counts that were left with a cliffhanger it happens take the Norm Coleman Al Franken Senate race in Minnesota in November two thousand eight that election wasn't decided until\nJune thirtieth two thousand nine after every available court challenge was exhausted\nWhat should we be bracing for this time joining me from Washington is David Wasserman editor and cook Political Report and from Phoenix welcome back to have post senior political reporter Kevin robot lard Kevin Dave both of you welcome back to America on the line\nThey chop them back I Dave let me start with you how likely is any permutations of the nightmare scenarios I laid out likely to happen [noise]\nWell it's it's certainly possible that we could emerge from election night not knowing who controls the house I think Democrats are a strong favorite for house control maybe\nSeventy to eighty percent odds foot and a good night for Republican Sen wishing caviar that sets\nA Democrats are are certainly can't seem to have that on on the least worst night for Republicans saw there could be some question as to uh several races that are very close a on the east coast in the mid west but also federal racist that might not be settled in California\nFor several weeks finally I Love California slow vote counts because it at the drama but that fight the nightmare for party strategist who want to\nWho the speaker will friday strategist how 'bout that millions of Americans who want a definitive answer a election night so I'm sort of anticipated what I was going to ask you in terms of of slow voting where where it could we see\nSlow voting half in California is notorious\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com every two to four years for\nThe top floor voting ... votes to slow down to I guess you got to fix\nAbout a month to finalize or all of it's a male and vote returns and often times more than half of the vote is counted up beyond a since the election day takes a long time to determine sectors and ... Democrats do better\nIn the votes are counted after election day cigarettes are trailing at a handful of braces find election I fair or they could make up that gap Washington state it's another place to look out for\n'em and Kevin one of the nightmare scenarios I rattled off was a run off ... what are the conditions that lead to a runoff and of course I'm thinking of Georgia and Mississippi start with Mississippi so Mississippi Israeli where we would have\nSort of a nightmare scenario in this case we wouldn't know who ended up with control of the United States Senate a\nDavid nightmare scenario sort of relied on a very good night for Republicans are relatively good night for Republicans there's no real way Republicans aren't very good night in the house a lizard rely on a pretty good to have very good night for Democrats and when it comes to the Senate\nIf Democrats are able to pick up maybe one seat and sort of hold onto their others control of the Senate could come down to a runoff in Mississippi likely between the Democratic candidate there who's a former congressman and agriculture secretary and your Mike asked me\nAnd Mississippi is a incumbent senator or Cindy Hyde Smith that wouldn't be decided until December that could be a real nightmare and knowing who would control the Senate you'd also likely see just a ton of money and resources from both political parties\nPoured into that state in an effort to determine control of the United States Senate or that said it is sort of an unlikely scenario again because it would run bubble really really good night for Democrats ... that just doesn't look hospital considering how Republican tilted the Senate map as in Georgia\nYou could see one of the most contested\nUm governors' races go to a runoff that's between Democrats Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp um if neither one of them breaks fifty percent on election night ... that race will go to our off\nAnd let me bring you back to to Mississippi one second before turning at my intention to to Georgia ... the race in Mississippi I'm Mike Espy versus the income than a ... this is a big deal because Mike as to be the Democratic um candidate\nHe shouldn't even be competitive in is in a red state like Mississippi no\nYeah it's it's a really interesting scenario um for all this to come up basically what happened is when a Republican senator Thad Cochran resigned earlier this year he triggered a special election which takes place under some sort\nOf different rules than a typical a Senate election what in Mississippi\nPart of that is including the runoff another part of that is that actually on the ballots there's no party registration lifted so none of these candidates under my cat's name it does not say Democrats under Cindy Hyde Smith name it does not say Republicans\nThat really could end up making a difference depending on how things break down\nThe reason this is likely to go to a runoff is because Cindy Hyde Smith It's also facing a challenge from within her own party from state senator Chris McDaniel he has sort of an arch conservative\nHe was one of sort of Steve Bannon warriors who you remember back at the beginning of the Senate cycle we talk a lot about how\nBad it was going to try to run challengers to all these incumbent Republicans McDaniel is going to be one of those challengers he hasn't really raised the money that he expected to and at this point it looks pretty safe based on pulling\nThat asked me and hide Smith will advance to the runoff but he's going to take away and after the vote from Hyde Smith to make sure that neither candidate ...\nOkay now now in Georgia and you laid out the possibility of a of a run off their one of the things that was we were talking about it on time\n[noise] hey from our content from New England Public radio ... ... ... ... per pound bag for music in a great story on our Web site or wherever you can get my\nSituation in Georgia with the um\nUh registrations that were being held fifty three thousand a voter registrations that were on hold\nAnd one of the things that came out was that whether your registration is on hold or not show up at the poll and polls and file a provisional ballot so talking about the difference between a provisional ballot and a standard ballot and how that I'm comes into play in terms of\nVote counting and whether we will we will that will add to the suspense or in Georgia\nAnd the Georgia governor's race yeah so this could add to the suspense of whether they wouldn't even be a rough riding on what happens here\nSo provisional ballot is basically used when there's some question about whether or not a voter is all about 'em in virtually all states under sort of the help America vote act which was back back in two thousand two after the recount in the presidential election in Florida um\nThe voter can cast a provisional ballot or almost all the time\nSo it varies sort of under what conditions you would cast one and the thing is many of these ballots can be a challenge in some places it's contingent upon the boat or to provide proof that their relatives of those sort of after the fact\nThe irony here is that uh it's probably Eric Cantor's all voters who are going to the side the outcome of that race and tell us how the nights going pretty early\nAlright I'm Dave Wasserman thank you very much for being on the show Kevin you're going to hang around for a little bit when we come back we're still take your calls and remember the question is will you be voting your fears or your hopes\nThis election give us a call at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five again that is eight more for seven four or five eight to five five you're listening to America on the line

as I said a going out of the last spring the governor's race between Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and former Republican Congressman Ron defenses is one of the most watched campaigns\nAnd at the moment Andrew Gillum seems to be it seems to be leading the distribution since she won welcome to America\nOn the line [noise]\nAnd so since the rally adjust to just finish right getting give us give us a sense of what's the mood was like in that\nRally because as I said Andrew Gillum is leading Ron Santo of the incumbent Senator Bill Nelson [noise] uh and and the current governor Rick Scott seemed to be in a in a dead heat with each other for the Senate seat so was this rally\nTonight helpful to to those candidates for not helpful [noise]\nIt was certainly helpful at this point uh the candidates on both sides are are are done trying to persuade people who might have been undecided in this particular governors right I don't think they tried very hard\nAt all I think both sides are particularly of the Republicans decided we're just going to turn out the people who\nWe um who we think voted for Trump I think we can do that we went and so there was no attempt it persuasion of independent voters are finally got a lot of Democrats\nAny of that what's interesting is time for the\nFirst time in ever really are the Democrats kind of did the same thing they take the most progressive Kennedy and who's not at all shy about it and they're saying look forget about reaching out to the middle we're just going to get our base there's more of a sudden them if we get tend to vote we went and maybe that's what we're seeing in the polling\nA cautionary regarding that polling the Republicans have very good\nCulture and they feel that in the end of the people who actually come out to vote will be those who traditionally have done so which are Republicans I think they have a shot at\nThe ... you know and and ... and ... to your point during the rally just before going on the air the president asked\nYou told everyone you know it's important for you to get out there and vote in fact you can vote now how many have you voted raise your hand\nAnd everybody raise their hands and he even said wait you've all voted it's a hundred percent why am I here and he throws his hands and walked around the stage [noise] can you do what was the mood like in the room was that an electric moment during that rally\nIt was up but you know I mean the people who come to the things they want that they wanted me entertained the thick of it more as a a professional wrestling event than a political\nThing right that's what they come here they they know they're supposed to boot CNN and hate on the media and and then share when the good guys I've done the things that they do you

these rallies we've become accustomed to seeing a lot of red hats\nI'm beginning to pick up a lot of green hatch did you see them\nAt the at the Trump rally just now I I did not what went wrong with it and that's what what what they said well I'm\nI'm I'm investigating how okay but my sense is is that the green hats are are tied to Pepe the frog I find that in Somalia that um you know in a low key essentially white supremacist right yeah\nI can be I've not seen those and I've been to several\nOver the last few months are both on my own tonight as well as part of the White House full and I'm frankly have not seen that\nSharif Japan tired of the folks who are at the rally tonight would you say that they are they are more dissent is voters or Rick Scott voters or are they Trump voters are they there\nBecause President Trump is there and Trump is there a guy and the census and and Scott or just ancillary figures\nYeah let's put it this way a Rhonda status is lucky if he can get like

forty three eight to five five\nA routine Carter let me ask you can just jump back in time deep back in time here because I read a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume designer is that right\nYes um when I was a younger uh say junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was the free counseling service for the city and\nPeople could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know\nUm there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and so we would ride with her and through um you know downtown or down go to ... she'd drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide\nYou know high on the back seat and my mom would say you know he looks okay he's got a clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause in which kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay\nAnd say you know John Hi George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of you know people is what I still used today to\nKind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with embracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah you know suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly you should have no there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the role of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat's essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world's constructed in that film and then to us as the viewers\nI feel that costume design or can be just to find his story telling design and you when people want to associate costume designer with fashion and\n[noise] hey for more content from New

story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear\nRight so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm In Hollywood I mean let me just ask let me ask you this when when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done what Fifteen plus collaborations with him\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee\nIn Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends and\nI I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so\nI kept you know modeling around him I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call USC or UCLA\nTo their film department and sign up on a student thesis project he said that would give me experience with being on a set and what that medium um would be like yeah\nAnd so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on the USC student film\nOr doing the costumes are well\nAnd then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right thing so I Want to play a clip on that day I was actually the first one and then do the right than to say OK I wouldn't be less likely fans out there like get your fill your\nRight leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movies to this day so I just

your stepfather stepmother who wants to see what the ... century American Pie is all you\nYou know might be fine so what so we ate it\nWants to be any American values equally so since we we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee's Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee and the thing about this film I'll read if I may say is that it really\nOne of his many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are wearing like a high top the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design well\nIt was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing uh during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England
