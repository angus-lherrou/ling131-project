Emily Hi amber thanks for joining America on the line tonight\nI\nAm or we all know how Trump is said putting denies involvement in the twenties sixteen election as ... as a credible source and maybe it was a four hundred pound hacker sitting on his couch and since that spin affective for him I guess listen to the similarities\nWith what he said this morning about the evidence that the Saudi Government had killed your colleague ...\nBecame friendly denied any knowledge of it didn't really know [noise] maybe I don't want to get it fine but it sounded to me like maybe they should have\n\nGot to get to the bottom of it but it was a\nDenial flattened NATO who knows ambush sound familiar\nYou're exactly right it hair long which I think three years now at this point on whether Russia meddled in that you know sixteen election ... he told CBS lightly style you know Russia I don't think China mental too in in my shift\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nI Believe the benefit of the doubt even when others in his party don't want to stand by that I'm thinking in particular Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race that Republicans walk last year um\n[noise] the question is why the president did very well and to get anyone he wants to stand by the benefit of the doubt take them at their word the question again is why\nEmily would actually [laughter] yeah well what do you think oh I'm Sorry the question for me not at all which I feel I was going to transition to but then you gave me such an interesting more so to follow up on [laughter]\nRight right yeah I it it depends on the situation it very clear in the examples that followed more closely here at home um men accused of eating badly in his orbit when people are cool ethically beneficial\nTo him he wants to stick with those people he doesn't want to drop them diplomatically I see\nA similar mindset in terms of him thinking of\nDiplomacy is relationship\nHe always talked about how much he likes Xi Jinping in China invite him or to get along in in Mexico the incoming president he they like each other and it's all about like the kind of surface level relationship and so I'm Wondering if that had something to do here with\nHis inability to say no to strong men which she's also said several times during the campaign he'd Myers\nEmily in fairness to Trump two things one\nThe Saudis can buy weapons from our adversaries China and Russia like Trump says if we cut off of themselves as punishment for this possible murder or some people are calling for maybe that's not the right to sanction\nAnd two American presidents for nearly a century less we forget our history our recent history\nHave been looking the other way while the Saudi Government commits all kinds of human rights atrocities mostly for the sake of cheap oil to support or consumer lifestyles so do you think Trump's Tony ended up to the Saudis is different and either kind or an degree in any way\nI think in the green it's different though I think you're absolutely right tried mine does have that history and there's a general reluctance on the part of American leaders to\nTo call the Saudis out on dates and useful to us and so I'm an African leaders tend to have to be forced into taking an adversarial position towards Saudi Arabia that this is such a frightening and um [noise]\nYou know blatant disregard for human rights that I think Trump has felt at least somewhat on the defensive in the last few days and it's looking of wrote killers which is an explanation that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut as says that the Saudis themselves are trying to circulate\nYou know that sort of by the Saudi line we don't have any sense of ... about why he thinks that's a plausible accusation rush and I think he's very um committed and the past often successful and kind of floating these\nFairly implausible excuses for people doing what looked like to be really terrible things and the uncertainty itself right the kind of who knows that's such a tell what's happened then it becomes yeah one more unanswered question that people can make up conspiracy theories about\nAnd when he says maybe it was real killers that sounds implausible because it sounds like strangers whooping into the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nTo go after Mr ... but now we have reports and several news organizations that the Saudi Government itself is going to say um this was an interrogation of ... gone bad\nAnd they weren't supposed to kill him\nAnd ... the Saudis kind of in conjunction with Trump or settings some of their own people up to be for guys wrote killers\nThat's exactly right on your situation where Trump is giving us out in a lot of wiggle room to try to get out of whatever it is true\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the past university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past dot edu\nWhich is likely to be met them in the international community turkey is to any minute now\nAccording to report to go into the Saudi conquered and search they released a video it's the a team of Saudi agents or you know of course when do stand bolt and tried to capture could show so\nOn the on the other side of the Saudi Arabia trying to say exactly as you said it Gawker and and Trump is giving them so much room to to make that case\nLet's move to the Elizabeth Warren story and by way of background she has come under fire from Trump and others for putting down on a professional profile\nThat she has Native American blood she did that once upon a time she grew up in Oklahoma and says that was family lore about some Indian heritage Trump uses it to argue she's a phoney and has challenged her to take a DNA test well guess what this morning senator one revealed she did say such a test\nThe tester at Stanford University did not know whose DNA he was examining and there was apparently a Native American ancestor six to ten generations ago so here's part of the video\nStill should've resigned President Clinton should've resigned in the nineties in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not so it wasn't an abuse of power no\nNo in thirty seconds amber does it matter this year what Hillary Clinton says and is there a generational split the think among women or at least democratic women on this\nI think it doesn't matter because the potential twenty twenty presidential candidate like just in general grant\nSaying that their parties should have been tough on Bill Clinton and essentially disagreeing with Hillary Clinton and so I sent you weren't really litigating that's all over again even with the Clintons out of the political culture um but in a way that's dividing the Democratic party so I think that does matter it's not something they're going to let go\nAmber Phillips politics goes London for the Washington Post thank you so much for joining us tonight thank you Tamil

E. T. R. dot net [noise]\nThis is in the our network from New England Public radio [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWell back to America on the line on news and call in show that the term elections from WNYC in public radio stations across the country Brian Lehrer infer Jonathan tonight\nAnd it's not just candidates on the ballot on election day there are more than a hundred fifty different ballot measures around the country these very so widely from state to state like from voters in Florida deciding whether people who have served their time for crimes can get their right to vote back\nLike they do and many other states to voters in four states deciding whether to cover more working class people under Obama Medicaid which they're Republican governors have declined to do to a proposal to repeal the sanctuary state law for undocumented immigrants in the progressive state of Oregon\nAnd a proposal to repeal transgender rights in the progressive state of Massachusetts to the red states of Michigan in North Dakota deciding whether to become\nRecreational marijuana states to Colorado's measure that would repeal believe it or not slavery as a legal form of punishment for certain criminal act that was never taken off the books\nIn the centennial state which by the way it's Colorado's nickname because it became a state a hundred years after the declaration of independence the centennial state so we'll talk about some of the most important and interesting ones now but here's something else to keep in mind\nSome ballot questions or put there because they helped drive voter turnout\nIn one party or another and that helps their candidates like it was widely believed that George W. Bush won re election in a very close two thousand four presidential election because Republicans put an anti gay marriage question on the ballot in the ultimate swing states that year of Ohio\nThat drove Republican turnout and Bush won by a hair so ballot questions matter times to Emily Babylon from the New York times magazine wrote last month about the Florida ex felons question and she is still with us Emily by way of background\nHow does that even become a thing in the United states of all the punishments for felonies large or small why did some states include losing your right to vote for the rest of your life\nThat's a great question though is that um permanently disenfranchised former felons started that in the early Nineteen century in states like Connecticut\nAnd they seem to have been you know I kind of punishment maybe as a parent in an idea of on continuing punishment\nBut they really take off during reconstruction in the south and like we see there and it's really clear from the history is that I southern states for force pick is on black people to vote in order to re enter the union\nBecause that was the terms for re entering the union they also tried to reduce the political power of steam\nFor many years offering a spiritual person will be a long term courage and his baby ... hurting US Senator December her [noise] grab your tickets no your honor [noise]\nFelony conviction on the states in the south including Florida they pass those permanent disenfranchised bans and then they included crimes like petty larceny\nIn the meantime there are actually also rounding up a lot of African American former slaves for crimes like larceny on often without really any proof and they were putting these people in prison and then leasing them as laborers to plantations\nSo you see this sort of double blow here where you're both imprisoning lots of people who work for a million slaves and then using that as an excuse to take away the vote for them forever\nSo listeners will open up the phones on this one who among the things that a felony conviction should cost someone their right to vote for the rest of their lives rather than until they've served their time and who thinks otherwise give us a call from Florida or\nWherever a aid for for seven four or five talk aid for for seven four or five to four or\nFive anyone want to tell your own story along these lines or that of a loved one or\nJust your opinion if you've ever thought about it maybe if you've never thought about it and you're hearing this are you thinking a ban them for the rest of their lives or what people can vote for the rest of their life even after they've served their time\nAid for for seven four or five talk the four four southern four or five the too far far\n... says Florida alone has a quarter of all the disenfranchised felons in the U.S how did that come to be\n[noise] you know there are just all those people who get prison sentences and Florida and it's now the third biggest state\nAnd so what you wind up with our number showing up more than one point five million people are permanently disenfranchised and Florida on that's one in ten of 'em all voters and in one in five African American voters so we're still seeing a kind of racial imbalance in the impact that this law has\nObviously this was part isn't too or those ex felons disproportionately and demographics that would tend to vote for Democrats\n[noise] yes probably I mean if there's some debate over that but it does seem like because I'm about thirty percent of them are African Americans and African Americans in Florida vote for Democrats at a rate of about Ninety percent\nThat there could be sun part is an advantage to Democrats if this and then the passes but I should say that it's not totally clear because it's also possible that the people who've been out for a longer maybe more likely to register and vote and those people tend to be white and tend to register\nAt reasonably high rates as Republicans and independents\nSo it's possible that this is not going to be some you know huge a turn Florida blue\nTool and that you know the argument that people are passing the amendment want to make is that this is just a tool of citizenship it's like you know a debt pay that status paid people should be able to have a second chance and that\nVoting is tied to people feeling like full citizens and there is an interesting research suggesting that the getting the vote back may um correlate with people being less likely to re offend so we could also take that benefit into account and evaluating this amendment\nIn fact I've read that the rationale for only allowing white men who own property to vote at the founding of this country the property part\nWas about the idea that you have to have a stake in the economic well being of the nation to vote responsibly so the opposite of how we tend to think today right that the wealthy use their influence to shape the law law to hoard the well for themselves\nAnd so arguably nobody has more of a stake in the economic future of their communities to the than the many men who were convicted of felonies in the era of mass incarceration which might be ending is too historically abstract for politics or anything like that getting set in Florida\nSo here's a hit too many years offering a special refill\nDeal on tickets for our Janice baby already hurting joined us for an evening advancing telephones taught sex and sipping some bubbly or aside car in the CDC is a hotel north happened

Pennsylvania so we didn't want to leave that implication especially for listeners in Pennsylvania who may be in that\nA position of having served time for something and leaving this impression that you can't vote for the rest of your life that's not the case as we just heard Emily confirmed and the Keystone State democracy is repeal of legal slavery gonna win this time we have twenty seconds\nI

P. T. Q. plus I'm writes\nUm it's one thing to fight over adding new roads it's another thing to consider taking rights away who was unhappy with the application of transgender rights in Massachusetts so\nUh in twenty six teen or the actual Republican governor Charlie Baker signed legislation that extended\nProtections to transgender individuals in public accommodations\nPublic accommodations include restaurants they include theaters parks on health care facilities but the real focus and this that fate has been on a public bathroom access and a members of the G O P have used a\nWhite Democrats\nRefer to scare tactics and focusing on public bathroom access to 'em sit jest\nThat women and children are in danger if someone pretending to be transgender war to enter a public bathroom ... facility that doesn't align with the gender that they were assigned at birth\nSo transgender rights might go away if there's a ballot measure succeeds in Massachusetts and Oregon might repeal it sanctuary state status\n[noise] yes so uh\nOregon has the oldest a so called sanctuary state law\nThat was implemented in Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd obviously sanctuary laws have been a contentious topic and\nThe Trump Administration has actually taken legal action against states and cities that have implemented these policies so it'll be really interesting to see whether voters ah uphold these policies are they'll repeal then\nWhy Oregon do you happen to know I mean let's stay hasn't elected a lot of Republicans lately\n[noise] yeah I personally haven't done extensive reporting on this my a

Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nDo she can support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation and culture\nWith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny and our world [noise]\nSteven Law to\nA different people from two different parties here with us ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway ah so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well as just stored Mary optimism there now fast forward to twenty Eighteen\nUm the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted\nIs farther away than ever Iran headed a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a leading nuclear power an oh India Pakistan and North Korea tested nuclear weapons and finally democracy is in retreat\nIn lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal right to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places without\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven worldwide\nIs it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places ah Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in Hungary backsliding in Poland a suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transformed the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed a you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nBy the way for all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China\nAnd Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nAll one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop in Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of its ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U. S. project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty said America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy\nBut you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking about\nA it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob in Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about\nBut we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this of this whole whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that\nRight and comment on foreign issues on a pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called liberal a Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and do there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and uh playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals\nBut as I Want to get to them in in a second about how you if you see this foreign policy elite is ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches

Democrats supported the Iraq War but it wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security the United states I mean that's part of what

you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nComments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful they're heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favor to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations at all if you go back to the uh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq were to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning\nBoth of them and then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars and us contracts there\nThat's right and then finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that has ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in Benghazi and the desire to end that now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYeah but so I just to follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think the role of\nUm the military would you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks and organizations who know not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money\nAll right well lots of ... at least get a couple of them and hear mc is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nI think so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think under\nUnder our current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well I worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nThank you for your call Stephen Walt well in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and more to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well with our national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a the Saudi journalist can show you a in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one ah that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump being fashion kicking up sort

strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nAh that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed\nThe multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\nWell that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nA given the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer at the United states is\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon\nA oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the
