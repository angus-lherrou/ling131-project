Senate intelligence committee in March Tim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me that story briefly of the election systems and software machine or the model six fifty tabulate machine and I should note that election systems in software\nIs one of the country's largest vendors of voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nActually brought that up a little bit already but all our library because there are some other details about yeah interesting why it's so it's a bow tie\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done\nVotes perhaps thousands that's part one another part is that it was ... it was the one that was able to be broken up with a with a with a writing pen\nAnd third um it it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security a lot of the voting centers of taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them for kind of sticking their head in the sands on this and not realizing that this is a problem and wanting it to kind of go away\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that that they found this um they'd also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence and so we never\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any machines are no because we haven't done those forensic audits that you're talking about I\nI think it's the latter I've not personally heard of of any now are being put on us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything these days yeah there's a strong chance that it's that have happened and I'm just not aware of it and that the people are\nWell Derrick Rose and buck at Kim points out that some states to use these this particular machine the model six fifty to process the ballots for entire counties and you can imagine and closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Braun a University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to de ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get sick\nSo is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important point so to begin with this is not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty fourteen the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of try to suppress that election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S [noise]\nI'm a question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary\nBased on their bottom line interest of trying to make money and were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security\nTo find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSystem here because the the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as ... as reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat ah E. S. and asks election systems in software actually I Believe sent a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary we have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nIt's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether I don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced explanation\nIt reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow new technology to emerge um so I think there's a problem there now the states or in a position where they unfortunately are under resourced\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses on firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nYou pattern so there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this was more on the ... not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to on point\nI think you up for civil let's just let's get your take on this um E.

let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that'd be who you are\n[noise] that is indeed who I Am\nA little secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in a law how is that the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we said we feel that we're pretty good shape we uh we actually started uh working on cyber security in our electrical systems back in two thousand Thirteen or ... at that time we did a full blown\nRisk and ball ability assess but um we had any recommendations or a or put it into a medium low priority or an animal is consistently work to get all those recommendations or place having said that we also to\nA federal tracing test and we continue to do a regular ... penetration tests as well uh and\nThink that that the the important thing to remember for most of for most of your listeners is that uh [noise] and it's been mentioned already but uh we are a very this decentralized system down for a modern unlike most of the New England we\nDesigned have county government Powell level to the state level or in\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I you know I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back into a march or before the Senate intelligence committee a you know we announce at that time that we are implementing soccer on occasion yeah we've got Web\nWeb applications fire walls in front of the ...\nWill will secretary of sensory kind of let me just jump in here your cell phone dogs also that shaky here but this is the key question when I ask you before hopefully your lungs hopefully like will fall apart but\nI'm seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you just take in Vermont to issue or the security of the voting system there as much as possible\nI mean NBC News is rupe reports that in August in late August there were three different methods used to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups trying to get access\nTo your your voter database did that happen\nYes I did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the world that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experienced was scans are a lot\nA lot a lot of the of the systems are showed us where they were coming originating from although the ... you can always count on that but the one that raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation voted out onto\nA department of homeland security through the communication ... hold a call that we have a developed over the last uh a year\nAnd a I think that\nThat you know our systems are getting paid thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is have you put the systems in place to defend against it\nBack in two thousand six teams that were Twenty one states that were targeted one state was breached and of those ... the the conversation is always about the one state that was released would never about eight or twenty states that are actually a defended again\nWe said was well received no I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached Honda is\nA it was I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nInteresting one last question for you briefly 'cause they want to turn back\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the path university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nWhat would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\nNow let me let me speak it or was that there are some parts that we need to do is one\nOf them even though it was the only way that you actually we do want to go confidence will lose ... pounds after thirty days election\n[noise] doing them ... thousands or a discrepancy yeah\n[noise] well Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYour walk\nA Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what to the secretary of state of Vermont had to say well\nI think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that I said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis machines or\nAnything like that there is a statistical sample of these ballot of the voter my paper ballots so that you can check and make sure the software\nI'm ... was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes a run on a very small secretary of state's department so the level of resources is going to vary widely I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHi Meg now\nI Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machines we switched to voter Martin ballots combined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning\nWe had locked suitcases for each district we have a\nStickers that keep the voting machine from being messed with much\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by a board of elections on those uh audit sheets how many ballots say have centralized become shrink wrapped in\nA package is the fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um our in our election bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gave a valid and\nHave a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking these ballot fat little circles in them for each candidate and um and that yeah they take the paper ballot they get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "22"}
