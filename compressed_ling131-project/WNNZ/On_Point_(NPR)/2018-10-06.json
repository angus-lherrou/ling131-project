point radio\nI'm Talking with Jackie ... percentage of the Daily Beast on point news analyst Jack Beatty and here in Studio with Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post\nKevin let's take a moment and turn to Trump's taxes that was a ... story by the New York city times you know taking a look at not just taxes but really the finances of the president what we learned from that and why do you think it matters\nA I think we are all shocked shocked to learn that Donald Trump ... major fortunate and not by the side of his brow but you know the old fashioned way inheriting the money from his father and then treating the IRS I Know it's it's a huge shock to all of us\nWell you say that but he sold a ton of books he says a lot of TV shows and whatever yeah he resented dismissing built this thing on the idea that he's a self made guy you see that\nHe is absolutely not he inherited I think something like four hundred million dollars from his father in today's dollars uh if you hadn't put that into the S. and P. five hundred you know he would have already been a billionaire without having to do anything on a lake of work\nHe is an incredible self self promoter I Will give him that that is absolutely true but if you look at the contents of this monster ... day you see that again and again this guy who supposedly has a nice touch 'em\nYou know and make made huge business errors and had to be bailed out by his daddy this happened repeatedly that's happened with his casinos and this happened with other businesses so this idea that he has some sort of um\nYou know special insight into how to run a business or or how to cut a deal I Believe he is charming I Believe and you know and and I I Believe he is probably an effective dealmaker in the sense that he can bully people into getting what he wants but the idea that he is self made is just bogus\nJust bogus well let's play a little bit of a what his press secretary Sarah Sanders had to say during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday a you know the report headed accused the president of questionable tax schemes and as you say Dodgers threw out here's what she had to\nTotally false attacks based on an old recycled news story I'm not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring fourteen thousand word story and the only thing I Will say one thing the article did get right\nWas it showed that the president's father actually had a great deal of confidence in him in fact the president brought his father into a lot of deals they made a lot of money together so much so that his father went on to say that everything he touched turns to gold\nEverything he touched turned a goal Jack Beatty when you read that story if it confirmed things that you already believe a or not or what news do you take from from having read that that peace\nWill choose the dimension of his um bogus self presentation\nYou know he was he was a gilded diaper guild diaper your red diaper babies there was a building started her baby and you know the one phrase that sticks out as self made sham or just the degree of this and then with the points to Catherine made\nA email questions of legalities which seemed to be there and outright fraud which some evidence of it's just the the his his upward failures you know you just keep failing and ... ... plaza hotel bust\nTrump airlines bust casinos fail or in other words displaying in finance and business the bad judgment about economic matters that were to use president\nAnd a and and and and David Farenthold who is really got the franchise on his taxes and so low points out that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches

never say anything against her daddy I'm Glad to be a ...\nA Jackie could sense when you think about this story about one of those things that strikes me is that part of my fascination is is that the president didn't release his tax returns has been done nominees of both presidential parties for the last I think forty years\nUh what repercussions if any other likely to be on the hill from what we've learned at least is this significant ... behind the Kurds\nWell yes and your abs and one of the biggest takeaway from the story and this was on this point has been made but the this gives us the best picture of Donald Trump's financial situation I'm In the past that we've had yet we don't have anything recent now speaking of recent it really a lot of this depends on who wins the midterms\nBecause Democrats say both Richard Neal and Senator Ron Wyden they will be the top of their respective committees and the house in the Senate that could request his tax returns and both of them came out right away and said that's what we're going to do we're going to get him to go if the Democrats take over if they try now they're going to be told though right\nLet's turn now to something that Trump's uh uh the president gets to Harold as big good news ah he's just a his administration has just been able to strike\nOr a new version of NAFTA or as he puts it to a brand new deal a with our neighbors to the north of Canada are neighbors the south in Mexico for this trade deal a on Monday Trump addressed how's rocky relationship with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau might've affected his ability to complete the deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada\nWe had very strong tensions if\nIt was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody is a much different deal to renew do not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal\nJustin Trudeau had his own thoughts during his press conference a speaking about the trade pact and hero the deal is a victory for all three countries as things North American trade would be in a much more stable place\nThat would have to preserve the fundamental principle of the original agreement which is that when you're trading partners ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\n... ... is this a brand new deal you know so why not\nThere is some stuff in there that is slightly more protection as there is some stuff in there that it's slightly more trade liberalizing but for the most part this deal looks a lot like the whole deal in fact it's kind of two deals to trade deals that Trump has previously called the worst trade deal ever\nSmash together that is NAFTA and the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP which\nObama had negotiated with eleven other countries and Trump immediately pulled us out as soon as he became president but yeah I mean it's funny we spent basically to last year and a half\nAlienating our friends and allies punishing farmers and manufacturers with rounds of tariffs and counter terrorists and busting apart and is a hard fought alliance that we had to try to alienate China and ended up basically in the same place we would have been had we not done any of those things and just\nProceeded with TV and more ... dealt with Canada and Mexico who were by the way quite willing to to update NAFTA or they themselves had said many times are both as part of the TPP negotiations and otherwise\nThat NAFTA was old and needed some modernization you know it didn't it didn't include like e commerce and a bunch of things that didn't exist in the early nineties so we're basically where we would have been um had Trump not brought all of this damage and destruction\nSo I don't exactly know what the pay office I'm given that we have this long term damage to our relationships with our allies to\nI mean there has been some praise from even some liberal consumer groups like consumer union I think praised as there are some other folks who say there are some things here that are good environmental when we were that was all in TPP so this is all you're saying that that\nThere were they may have been some benefits this but the way you see it as that at the cost in our relationship with our trading partners is actually the ...\nNo more than eleven hundred listeners joined the any PR family last week thank you so very much if

what forces did they say you're going to be shaping this election\nWell it's been really interesting to last a day or two on me starting to hear some nervousness from Democrats I'm On the hill and elsewhere about how this Cavanaugh a confirmation was playing out initially because of all the allegations that were coming forward I'm from I women in his past\nThere was a thought that a vote for Kavanaugh would cause a backlash among women um with Republicans that said as the average has gone on and that so much more it's come out there is a feeling I'm within Republicans and I don't care where what part of the party are talking about at this point that he's been under attack\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce

you're starting to see the Republican base wake up\nAnd really get back to get engaged and to get involved which is exactly what Democrats do not want so yesterday you were hearing from Democrats okay let's just get this over with so we can go on and start you know go back on the campaign trail and refocus\nOf people on other issues now will that momentum from the cabinet vote should he be confirmed today we do not know that yet\nAre I'm Sorry tomorrow um we do not know that yet but ... but if if he is confirmed will the anger on the right to be able to sustain itself for five weeks I have a hard time believing that just because of how fast the news cycle tends to go\n... you know we talked about the legacy of Anita Hill Clarence Thomas and his uh sharing she of course has been on the bench ever since uh is it your sense of things have changed in any way as a result of these terms in terms of the conversation about uh about allegations of sexual assault and the way in which they're handled\nI think before the hearings I Would have said that yes we take these kinds of accusations much more seriously today in the wake of me too and the way have greater awareness of the prevalence of um problems like sexual harassment and sexual assault\nYou mean as a result of hardy once I hardly yeah\nRoger ales known yes so many major figures who has been accused of various kinds of\nA sexual misconduct and have had a fall from grace as a result uh and I would add plenty of other you know Bill Cosby amongst others you know people who are like blood figures are very powerful figures now ... yes exactly um who have\nBeen punished to some extent for their behavior\nThat said the way that these hearings and accusations related to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have shaped up um suggests somewhat of a different lesson which is that it's not so much that I'm\nA people on the left has become more fired up they were already fired up about issues related to me too and sexual misconduct instead you have people on the right more fired up if you had asked me a month ago whether I thought that having a Supreme Court nominee at a Trump nominated a Supreme Court pick\nA credibly accused of sexual assault whether that would be good for Republicans\nI would've said no but that is clearly not the lesson that we have seen we have seen that the the right as Jackie mentioned has become much more energized by this fight the last was already energized a again before all of this happen on these kinds of issues but now the right is and if you look at the enthusiasm gap\nBetween Democrats and Republicans going into the midterms it has greatly narrowed I think that the whole fight has in fact I've been good for Republicans ironically\nJak where do you see this do you see this end up playing playing out in the election or do you think that it's more likely when what we were talking about earlier about the economy\n[noise] I I I don't know I think ... probably just write about the dynamics that you know the Republicans going to have left to be indignant about the indignation now will pass to the Democrats\nUh uh but uh but to get back to this you know ... this this the the the whole accusations against judge cabin or you know what we saw in two thousand sixteen the character didn't matter to Republicans\nA group of political scientists who study the president's paddle\nA couple of hundred of them uh last year so that the president was already the worst president as an American history where we can't do that but he's certainly among the most of the worst characters who've been president who's lying all the stuff with women and so on but that\nDoesn't matter to Republicans now do you mean we can voters or demean folks in the party check\nI I I mean I'm In I'm In Republican voters they essentially made that that is what Hillary Clinton's campaign was all about he's a bad man look what he's going to do you can't have what were you told your daughters about him it none of that mattered a and it it was ... it doesn't matter either\nGetting some response from people on line of listeners who are saying uh uh one Sandra asks do Republicans

achieve their hope of taking over the house\n[laughter] oh wow I'm All right so um I Do not have my map in front of me right now I'm you know what if you\nThink of a couple of key key races ones come to mind\n[noise] um you know there are ... when you talk to the party chairs um which I have they talk about other Republicans talk about um several states in Minnesota that they thought our\nOur bellwether as there are two open seats there are two seats that have current members and I'm I'm pulse and and Louis\nUh those seats are safe there watching to see how how the tide turns um I think any district where he and I think Texas is going to be very interesting not necessarily because of the Senate race there but because of you are seeing record a voter registration and Texas\nAnd you're seeing in the house seats where perhaps the turn out\nThat a barrel Rourke is um generating might end up toppling some of these Republicans who have been there for quite a while and we have to wait and see again a month is a lifetime right now I'm In a in this cycle but I you know anywhere where I'm\nHillary Clinton won in a Republican seat keep an eye on those seats on anywhere where you have 'em in a suburban women are going we're all going to be watching them and what they do and the next ... a month or so who they're siding with independence\nI'm really uh it it's going to be fascinating I'm asked to you know where where we see 'em movement but certainly um suburban districts as well\nJackie you know a lot of uh you saw a number of Republican retirements in districts uh and I think in the Senate level as well where lawmakers had discomfort with Trump or were being a opposed by sort of pro Trump figures within the party primaries\nAh what's ah\n[noise] ah what are you seeing in the general elections to how closely are Republicans tying themselves to the White House or distances themselves from it\nI think it depends on where you are um but all you need to do and Jeff Flake said this week I think and they all blend together so forgive me if it was friday of last\nBut this week Jeff Flake said that he couldn't have done what he did in that committee um with with Kavanaugh had he been running for reelection so there really is um is there really is a thought in particularly in places like Arizona\n[noise] the president evangelical supporters are working

about her new memoir world days will touch on the comedic topics and tougher ones including the themes of surviving trauma in workplace harassment and think a little bit about the ways we learn from ah sitcoms\nIn their handling of burning issues here right across from me in Studio here in New York City is of course the repressive will Eli Kemper Emmy nominated started the Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right there you heard the show's theme song A L e a\nKimmy Schmidt it was as you say in your book and rightly so it is\nCrazy pitch of a series or just you know the two sentences tell us to set up of of of what Kimmy Schmidt is and how she writes in her ... ... ... ... you know where she is when she writes at our delta it's\nInsane so she said the backstory of Comey is that she was kidnapped\nWhen she was fourteen years old I'm held underground in a bunker for Fifteen Years and then rescued by the FBI or where she is a brought back into the world and decides to make a new start for herself and of course New York city\nThat we start so I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it ... um [noise]\nI certainly thought when I heard the idea for the show that someone somewhere with ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the set up for an extremely tough tough drama that's exactly you know you could imagine HBO tree you know the guys who did the wire doing this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet it at a rubber car like Tina Fey made it into a an extremely funny show\nSo tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the sets did your outfits like everything is incredibly bright almost pastel right yeah and you could not be um you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as ... character yeah but you could not be basically a more default sunny earlier\nI Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girlish she wears bright pink pastel pants much you might like LA's chagrin because I don't I don't like this\nBut she wears frightening shorts floral shirt she wears jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and at at the same time she has this fierce\nTenacious warrior who has been through something to think of all and I'm so difficult that I Can't actually imagine what that must have been like\nAnd yet she continues\nTo choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that sort of tenacity up or or if you had a forced to develop it during you know at a test\nLike the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah uh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are ... and friend Titus a tries to give her a goodbye hug on the first day of school\n[noise] I don't know if you're a tie it might be other on the

do you look at this rather dark comedy with such cheerful is\nI I don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as as very serious as the one\nUm that can eat the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it is and the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's an it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know ... ... fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so and it was that I went abroad anthem Eichler it reflects life but it does\nWell so you decided to flee show created by Tina Fey done initially for NBC and leave it was a Robert ... who's the head of entertainment I guess he was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's fill this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this right I\nI don't and I I think really don't know the conversations that takes place so I\nI get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again a you know I I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus was sending her off to school because she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up till till you're twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I think China has gone on Instagram before you honestly honestly where she's [laughter] I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been her her adolescence stunted it's it's Arrested Development and she's coming out\nUm as it [noise] twenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life no big deal done I think you are but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\n...

others Tina Fey Amy Poehler meaty killing a camper started to Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is with me in the studio thanks for being with us again thank you for having\nMe so I just want to pick up on something that we were talking about uh uh during the break a which is where's the line you guys joke about me to you guys make clear her feminine or you know can be Schmitz feminist higher\nYou know and also yet you have her be sort of the comedians do fit a almost backing into being a complete sexual harassed or the workplace\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories ... operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications they passed dot edu\nAnd the ... been struggling with them and sort of wondering about that every day because it does seem like so much is changing in comedy and um you would never want to trivialize or a little anyone's concern and so I don't know\nI don't know where is the line between making a joke and making a a an observation and so\nUm I think it's it um it's a it's an enlightening time and it's a powerful time because it ladies are feeling a comfortable and secure and coming forward and and of revealing what has happened to them and there's nothing more powerful than owning a truth like that\nAnd I I don't know if you know it's it's jokes that I think you could've made\nYear ago or two years ago art are no longer funny and so trying to figure that out is a good or bad for you I I mean luckily a lot of my humor does not go into like you know\nUm that that kind of material so I I'm up by that I mean like I'm not known for like my fence it bold comedy but I think that it is\nWhen writing the book I was I was very my editor and I were very concerned with how on something might come across ... again it wasn't writing a lot about like um [noise]\nUh uh subjects that were enormously sensitive but at the same time something that you might just think oh I'm just rattling off a little joke it might not be\nSuffering point is it like Michael Jordan who's like look I don't get involved political stuff because Republicans are by sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from\nFrom that stuff to things yes I Am the Michael Jordan comedy yes I think that's very your icon on the logo [laughter]\nThank you for recognizing natural and second [noise] yeah I mean it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't mean you ... you can't not be political now it's the too crazy and\nA momentous a time so I think you can't just say well I'm not going to get involved\nBut I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with them so I I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because\nThere are in some ways like the last question on this I Want to ask is you know do you think that Kimmy Schmidt ultimately in the way it handled this in addition to getting laugh in addition to make sure the humor was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we were to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to me I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to make these points um both political and feminist points\nWhile also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I I Would no I I think it's too crazy at time\nTo avoid that we played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids which itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... ... ah apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch way ... ... talk and yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you said that you've been asked not just by fans by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes some women are funny\nAren't funny I [noise] it's it's hard to have some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you know some women are short it's\nBeen like to ride the train well others prefer to take them we are different\nFor more than eleven hundred listeners joined the any PR family last week thank you so very much if you didn't get a chance to step up you can join anytime by making a contribution at our website any P. R. dot net thank you very much\nAs well as from from the right I think women are different from one is in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different ... and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from our borders standards you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully some of them was muted than others\nBut I I think that is that when bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know if reporters have a conference of what happens but everyone decided like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay we are so women can be funny but I have\n... being honest\nI never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was based on the box office success and bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you can make\nA very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it what are you talking about yeah they've always been funny\nIt's funny when after a delay Christopher Hitchens who knows the noted British an intentional controversial as he actually wrote this thing for vanity fair's ... obviously women are not fun and they don't need to be a ... something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in the two thousands with that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv I think and I said it did a less of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen it's from white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed that the movie was funny and I thought get out of my inbox because what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised\nMe furious because but I I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue if someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nSo you know ... on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money back that yes [laughter] sometimes you work with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig a\nOh what did you what did you learn what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of I think public we tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians we'd be like you know you got to be tough to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\nThat what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Tina Fey or just by watching her because that women lead by example and she doesn't complain and she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "06"}
