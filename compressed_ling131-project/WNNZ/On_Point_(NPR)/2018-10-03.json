it right now it does not look like she Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking out specifically denies the allegations are the key line here is\nMany decades ago the IRS you inside those transactions and then she goes on to it\nThan New York times or was it just to me is that there's not a clear denial of the things that the New York times accuses President Trump of doing that being said the New York times

himself as a self made a self made man who went from queens to Manhattan and made it big and made it bigger than even his own father do you think that that is actually going to have any kind of impact at all on the president's standing\nI have stopped guessing a long time ago with the with the president or you know I I my\nOwn personal theory is if you're on the left and you don't like rather than chump you got any number of things do not about to get you to the voting booth the the million dollar question of course is what the Trump bait feel about him with all the negative news coverage\nAnd if there is something that could sort of\nPull apart the glue between Trump and its\nBase certainly a possibility he went out this is the complete opposite story that the president successfully\nSoul to the owners in two thousand sixteen then he'll run the country and like he had to jump empire\nRight yeah and I think go ahead and I wanted to add that like a a mate\nLast summer there was also a New York state that's occasion that charity was run as a fraud and so if you look at these together in the picture of a remarkable lack of integrity of the credits and far\nRight now I should also point out that New York state um put out a statement today saying that they're going to be taking a look at some of the the the allegations that are in the New York times report let's move now to do what's going on with the FBI ... of\nThe allegations against judge Kavanaugh Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said today that this whole thing could be wrapped up later today if not tomorrow and Dr Christine Blasey Ford's attorneys have been now have said\nThat they haven't heard from the FBI from a process perspective amber\nHow can how can Senate Republicans actually wrap this up in it by Wednesday and have anyone believed that this was the process that senators flake pollens Murkowski and and and Coons and others are wanting to have happen\nDoesn't critical political question here and that's the question of also determined just kept an eye fate\nIs whenever the FBI investigation wraps up\nI however salt or not and bought the White House was guiding the FBI investigation who ever they talk to it\nTo a handful a Republican and Democratic senators who decided they thought it was there and that and they've made very clear he mentioned over the past couple of\nDays they want a fair investigation or they're calling deals that to consider voting for cats and I and as this week\nSo amber I have a I'm a\nBit of a not a conspiracy theory but a theory because it involves um again

Collins and Murkowski and flake in order to confirm judge Kavanaugh his nomination goes down the Republican Party base is enraged\nAnd that gets them to come out and potentially help save\nOr or at least preserve the Republican majority in the Senate am I going too far in my thinking here\n[noise] well I'm\nOn the opposite side of what would happen [laughter] okay in the right we're all trying to guess right near\nIt cannot doesn't get confirmed because\nHow do Republicans go back home to voters and say we can show all of Washington and there was a slam dunk Supreme Court the that would

seems to have done with a lot of controversial decisions over the Justice Department including whether he left the top guy attorney general Jeff Sessions go\nA house Republicans as sort of picking up that mantle for the president do they want to interview Rosenstein and talk to them about whether he tried to\nWiretap the president or get cabinet official to impeach the president and the real danger for Rosenstein because House Republicans a group of than it already filed impeachment articles against them\nOr is it possible that the president could and maybe he has cooled down and could convince House Republicans to cool their jets when it comes to Rod Rosenstein\n[noise] you know that's a great question I watched the token poll closely between President Trump and his allies in the

Eighteen to twenty five and they're saying that they are ... are they is specifically saying that they are afraid of being accused of sexual assault for do they feel targeted just for\nYou know micro

just rumors start tapping into social media runs wrap it was something that can't even see\nAlso it's Carmen more common than we want to believe that that age group of people up bread I become legislators\nRent I Want to thank you very much for calling into America on the line Brett was calling in from Rogers, Arkansas Brent gave us a lot to to think about there and that gets to the bigger question that I wanted to ... or bigger topic I wanted us to discuss in that is\nAs Brad was talking about there's there is a swath of the American electorate that feels like Brett and Brett's sons and they're going to be going to the polls in thirty something days\nAnd the president given what he said and given Brett Kavanaugh's a performance last Thursday\nIs that really is this really a thing have we hit a cultural moment where where straight white aggrieved men are going to view this moment as they're rallying cry to show up at the polls\nWhether or not they show up at the polls is as one question but I mean I don't I think we shouldn't rush too quickly passed the the meat of the thing that brand is talking about because I haven't heard versions of that\nRepeatedly and reporting on the United states and finally when we've been talking to to Trump supporters and to sort of alienating white people in general and um and the problem is that there are ... there there are more than one things have one thing happening at the same time one you know there are not\nAh these questions about accusations whether they'd be false or not\nA exist outside of a world we we don't have a world in which we have actually created systems for dealing with sexual harassment and so everybody all of us having idea about it than Israel because we have done a terrible job of creating systems for dealing with sexual harassment period and if we actually had customs in place and nobody would have to feel\nAnxiety about false accusations are true accusations 'cause there'd be a system set up for dealing with it\nAnd so that's one set of conversation that we should be having as a society but we can't have it as a society because we have the president of the United states\nAnd one of the major parties when the two major parties using a megaphone to to to rile up\nEight this this white male greed that sniff identity politics a white male agreements that makes it impossible to have an

subjects of the Russia investigation and the story of how Russian President Vladimir put and tried to undermine American democracy it's a story so complicated so nuanced that journalists then investigators have yet to get to the bottom of it\nBut you've gotten close if you have gotten closer than Pulitzer Prize winning reporter\nGreg Miller he covers national security for the Washington Post and his new book delves into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen presidential election it's called The Apprentice Russia a Trump Russia and the sub sub in the ... version of American democracy and I spoke with him earlier today\nGreg Miller welcome to America on the line thanks very much so the title of your book is a play on the reality television show that citizen Trump made famous but how are you using to monitor The Apprentice your new book\nWell you're right so it's it's the name of the show that propelled him to such great fame I think that it works on a couple of other levels you know obviously he came into the White House pretty unprepared for the job never held public office before I'm needed a lot of kind of um\nStaff and expertise around him to function in the job and even then it looked pretty clunky at times and then of course there's this other aspect to it ah this this civility that are characterized as his relationship to prove or seems to\nUh and so you know he's he's an apprentice president in some ways sometimes he seems to behave as if he's an apprentice to boot and that seems to be his model that is who he often that's who he admires and sometimes it's who you emulates how does that ... that\nAdmiration for the Russian President how does that go over with the national security community that you cover and have been covering for years\nThat's a really great question and I think that the reality is that a that\nThis this is a schizophrenia administration you have a head of state the president who believes one thing about Russia or who rejects most of what his advisors tell him about Russia let alone what all of U.S intelligence agencies have concluded about Russia [noise]\nUh but you have this whole separate um entity [laughter] I mean he would call it the deep state but it's not that deep I mean I think these are his many of them are his advisors who work closely with him in the White House\nThey see a completely differently and they do their best to try to minimize the harm or to try to keep the Russia policy or on ... make it resemble what it has been a through our recent history\nCannot withstand a president who is bucking um decades' worth of practice can't can that or other part of American government withstand a President Trump\nThat you know that as the big test a lot\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farm stand small ones farm dot com\nAnd enormous stress test right now I'm In the White House with this president and I think it's an unanswered question so far I think that um\nWe don't really it's hard to know what the what the damage to these institutions might be beyond Trump's term however long that ends up being\nI think that the Justice Department and the FBI or under particular stress and you could point to a areas where they are holding it together and doing well right the Mueller investigation has racked up all of these indictments had have made him has made it an incredibly compelling case that Russian interference was real\nAnd yet you know Trump is doing everything he can can much of the time to discredit the FBI as an institution to make it look like it is politically motivated um any surface some real stuff right there had been problems that he has that have been exposed to all of this drama\nUm such as well the the tweet the a tax between these FBI agents and so forth they kind of I'm In ... the the\nThe drama around McCabe a former FBI deputy director I'm Around the uh Rosenstein and his you know impulse is to to put a wear a wire and meetings with the president you know this is weird stuff\nIt go it goes hand in hand with the Trump president\nDo you do you believe that um deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in the story that um that's been out there\nThe pushback has been Rosenstein was joking but the reporting is he wasn't joking where do you where do you land on that\nMy sense and I write about this in the book I don't write about um his proposal to wear a wire but what I Do write about in the book is how um\nHow disturbed she seemed about I'm sort of emotionally\nAfter what happened in the county fire in his hand in it how he was used right the White House makes this decision Trump makes this decision to fire James Comey but then pins that decision on Rod Rosenstein is deputy attorney general\nHe writes this memo that the White House points to it says this is why we're taking the step Rod Rosenstein says he's the terrible FBI Director\nRosenstein in the in the aftermath of that is just aghast he sees his reputation he built up\nOver decades in the department just going up in flames and his reaction or in the in this moment um he's behaving a bitter radically at times he's sending messages to colleagues that make them concerned about his emotional uh wellbeing\nAnd so I I kinda think that he I I tend to believe that this did happen that he does propose it in a serious way he sees this is a crisis right um [noise] uh and he uh he um he

television host of\nShow such as men versus wild which aired from two thousand six of two thousand eleven and a host of running wild with their grills he's author of the new book how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation\nUm end up before the break their break a fuse me before the break a bear people tell me that talked too fast so maybe I should say here I'm a you were telling us about a couple of friends there in the studio that was a little unexpected to me because we didn't know that we have anyone else with you on your end in London but you know what even inspired me about\nA this is talk about the survivors mindset and getting outside your comfort zone so we're going to get outside of our little radio comfort zone here for a minute good if we can you re introduced us to you too who your friends are and he said they have an incredible ... survival story [noise]\nWell what I was saying it's a survival is this is so much about the spirit you know and the rest of it is the arena that we ended up playing and whether you're stuck in a life raft or whether you're on a plane crash or whether you're dealing with bereavement illness or whatever it is all about having that survived a spirit\nAnd you know a a it's a it's great I Love being yeah love to hear about this I'm excited to to get questions from your list is but I always try and kind of\nBringing inspirational people as well and I'm been assigned to\nA couple that I've met they reach out to me that you'll hear the story in a minute but I really wanted to meet them and I say hey come and join me fussing few because this is a fun one and I will take some questions and all of that but what they know about is is togetherness and an holding on uh-huh okay though and Ben is aged\n... eleven fellow then Simon is is that ... ... ... a little bit about your ... well hey man I'm Sorry for the first of all since I don't know who you are not our listeners don't know can you just introduce yourself a little more fully what what's your full name and where where are you from\nI'm I'm Benjamin almost a uh I'm from ... in England I Am\nAn eleven okay and your dad is Simon sitting next to you there in London yeah that's correct yes hello Simon what's and what's your full name also from Cheshire I presume I guess Simon ... okay well the great to have you with surprise guests on this show so so tell us a little bit about what bears talking about what's your your survival story\nI'm telling you okay if he's a bit nervous or the wind or it's all in an unexpected\nBent bend has quite by ...\nA he can be costs hospitalized for about four days out of time I'm being able to breathe I'm\nSo he's on a regular ... medication for that but he he wants to get better and fights and so\nHe's he's tried boxing but most recently um says program on this new book especially as inspired him to go out and about so he loves going climbing into my own since he's always pushing himself\nOr ... every time we go um he he uses an inhaler ... on using the inhaler now so he's really pushing themselves getting higher up in the mountains like literally on\nYou know using the inhaler last he's he's really pushing him so she knew spirits\nWell that sounds great and and and Ben let me just turn back to you really quickly so uh what is what is it about about bear and what he's done in his book that inspires you to to push yourself why why do you want to do that I'm very inspirational because\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\n... stranger okay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes ... I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven to ... from an episode of ... man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next\nTime they drink my I had never done before and I'm going to be pretty horrible [noise] but I Need to keep going and [noise] it may seem disgusting but your own urine is safe to drink [noise]\nFair\nGrills or re high grading in Western Australia in two thousand seven uh then\nYou and I forget that I'm going to let you off the first time either entirely that bend you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky I've got about a novel that I Will do stand would you go so far as\nYou're in if you had to stuck on a mountain [laughter] deep fans [laughter] probably a little bit Simon thank you for big our surprise guests this hour uh ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA lot of things in survival of disgusting you know but I have learned you leave your prejudices behind you go to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to taste nice ... nice and survival fluids need I taste nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and\nI'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for the future if you ... a few of them over the years and I kind of make a swift exit if I get ... by somebody tells me they do it for fun I don't\nThink in your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still is that if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia being dig\nA hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it and the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cup\nAnd you say you stay here if you you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still moist junior year and will condense into clean drinking water but why didn't you know that\nThat's the thing is if you really de hydrated\nDrinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make us so it was still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that paying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get fluids out of that but\nIf you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in a survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out those fluids ... clear\nThat that can actually help hydrate you so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways maybe paying onto your clothes and wrapped around the head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know neat things about the bunch of times I mean it was my love looking back on it because if it was a crew the guy ... thing for the next few days we moved into my ... just wrapped around my neck in a on a head scarf of pay and you know but he said let's see if it's about whatever Italians in it\nAs you mentioned your crew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew is there with you with their equipment having to go through the terrain as you are I mean how how how much do you ask them in terms of er of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nYou while they are they're incredible they really are there with me from day one small team you know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thinking about them is true\nStreaming of New England public radio

got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation a bear before the break we heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces out of here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training and he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now [noise]\nNo festivals the respect for your service\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSo right there the bathroom for survival is won or lost in the mind um the C a training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is ... tough\nAnd the time on your own or I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're into this you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and\nI she found ... ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this as a lone survivor to look up to yourself and again you know when we now is the crew you know women filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting a shell to getting a fog and someone else would be needed just to put a first on that well you do you know the bow drill the everything on the right to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through the\nThe days on our and it was just doing ... and ... collected firewood repairing the setting snag is doing that you know\nAnd by the end is how you\nSaw it on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beat you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they are doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere just one more thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training as thinking he's\nReally highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly mace spending three hours trying to lie to five but that is often the reality set in the old days when the Memphis while shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing that so you know hours and hours setting ... ads and all that I Would say that she was going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited ... bit of music and ... got a fog guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said ... the show survivor of summed up three was never give up it's all about that too nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why\nThe rule to we've got to do get that determine your next Saturday that the British and the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round of quick quick way here for by the way to rabbits for a few people\n[laughter] that's got to be ... ... ... yeah I I I've seen is Seventy says we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave them nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm editing themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like counted showing that they like stream weight loss\nThat is the reality is survival is yes you're starving you de hydrated you're frightened you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation it's survival situation how misery\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed to the installation

they desperately to hear about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know so\nUm but on the whole ... you're not getting the land ... by the failures then you next time I got ... to ... that one again\nAll right so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingested a poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine in the ... made big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and then ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if there's doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that ... like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one side great film you know the end of the Wyoming the Alaska insight into one day and I had a ... hour on TALK ran to get it wrong ones out there\nYeah by the way if you have it from folks have already Jon Krakauer original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise] well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress of a good thing she's going to snap in the wild and she's often dislike made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity [noise]\nUm and actually some of them they have the

R. dot net\nIt's a um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nYeah they're they're low overall um recent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of more contiguous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean ... white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election naturally gonna what's\nProbably drive any kind of success that Iraq fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challengers the congressional level many of whom have a really harness this vote and could potentially do well\nBut I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better or work they don't treat it typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being a out of luck poor partner places like Ford been county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another\nLevel of success that Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card in elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always sad vagaries and that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it's because it's a non voting stay so if you get all these populations who don't usually vote\nThat could change what Texas looks like if you change the electorate you can change gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and\nAnd angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats are likely to vote during that time so if if that's a different this year like this could look different than most mid term yeah and so I'm seeing is for example\n... wrote to 'em a couple of Saturdays ago it was quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever showing up and listen to you talking to to to voters or or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so it was he hoping\nTo dry out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the taxes that we've seen in other places we saw that in New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nIf he's betting on yeah yeah that would go had written and I'm Sorry I'm\nSorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout is in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about thirty percent which is\nExtremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million on register Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about thirty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there are still some fundamental voting demographics and make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nWell I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should know that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools and as a creative non

his\nContentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax kind of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and

are are listening and listening to end and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nOnly wear shorts every every\nYou know\nThe George Washington actually run for mortgages\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an add that to rub of Senator Ted Cruz of campaign is running\nOr go\nTo Jim you\nLive in\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz brand of running house that that Ted Cruz add ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership of the ideas that\nI'm a ... you may be liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the techs told there because it's for our country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign to understand how to run in Texas they know that there's a certain size guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep me to people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican support\nIn a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work\nOr walk past a tangible you make up about a million votes and that just hurts God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in the term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and prime conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air Hi\nGood morning I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I voted for Donald Trump\nAnd um I grew up in a conservative household and they had then it's conservative my whole family is but I've been very encouraged and I and voting for that to the work that election in November just because people can be on party lines and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in the day and age aren't like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is going out there and and making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine catch a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did okay so what's changed other hand\nIn that I'm really whenever he within twenty they fail action\nAnd how you get like the talk that whenever I can do\nUm president trial they can get how like how he's steady getting fan and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that\nYou're a true um I think it's important that pregnant true colors man how he just\nWas really again President Trump's nominee for him like\nThat show you something about how many personality you know I really appreciate how that he'll work is just\nUm he is who he is of course the owners that few\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that

over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he in the review he wrote some I'm\nAn unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts or need to say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it ... and um I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for some college I I just don't get that for a long names right\nYeah ... ... I I just want to say I don't know it was a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably is what gets us in trouble so\nWho thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be the Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talks the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenge of\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar thing I from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women had been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough ... than I Do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscored that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came up from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military in Oregon ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated frankly with people like me and the vision of public trials and power who have been able to resolve it brings jobs just for what has been drawing and just offer to January dropping in this country and I've only\nPeaceful while the country are watching these games they drink on me to Reno rejection that are ... to this problem to ensure that we know why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more American than before [noise]\n\nAshley Lopez or as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "03"}
