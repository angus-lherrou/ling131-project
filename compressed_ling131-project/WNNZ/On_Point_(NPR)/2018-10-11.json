O T L\nK joining me to explain what Medicare for all really is and what it isn't is Jonathan Cohn senior correspondent for half post\nJonathan Cohn thank you for being on America on the line thank you for having me on the show so Johnson the Democrats failed today to pass a bill that would have eliminated what's being called short term health care plans but don't cover pre existing conditions what are the short term plans and why did Democrats wants to eliminate them\nShow short term plans have been around for a long time and they're kind of an artifact of the old you know the old Arab before we had the Affordable CARE Act um and\nThey were designed as basically a stopgap you know you're between jobs you ... you know you you you're going to be a couple of months you know between this dish employer an employee or your insurance is going to lap and you could pay out of pocket\nFor these policies and they weren't very good right I mean they cover some things and you know maybe it's some doctor visits or maybe they didn't didn't some hospitalization up to a point on and they wouldn't and it and they were ... like the old policies were right you couldn't get them if you had preexisting conditions and ah if you\nGot one of these policies and they discovered\nThat you got sick but you'd actually had it before you bought the policy they wouldn't pay for that either are they charging more for your pre existing condition um you know a four to ... comes along Obamacare comes along and now everybody can get a you know it's supposed to be able to get comprehensive real insurance right you know the kind that you know would cover any medical service you might need and\nYou know has a limit on you're out of pocket costs and\nThe Obama administration said okay well you know now that we have this we don't need these short term policies anymore you know and they kind of let them linger but they were really\nCareful to say look they only last for three months and maybe it was basically they didn't want people buying these policies in part because a lot of people would buy them and not realize they were basically buying like a piece of junk coverage or something close to it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un university graduate schools MSA in creative non fiction writing and rolling now for August twenty seven applications at ... dot edu\nRegulations that made you know ... brands have insurance available to everyone regardless of pre existing condition they couldn't do it right I mean we we all remember last year you know John McCain John McCain with a thumbs down and they mail it to pass\nA law so they've been trying to figure out ways to accomplish their repeal by executive action and and someone had the idea that well gee what if we just let more people buy these these other ... short term policies ...\nBasically they lifted the restrictions on them so you can basically take out one of these policies now and keep it for a whole year and renewing and um [noise] you know the idea is that these policies if you can get one they're going to be a lot cheaper but that's because they cover a lot less and if you get sick you're going to be in real trouble and if you're already sick you won't be able to get one\nRight and and and that's the thing so is it that the short term plans are really good if you are basically healthy\nYeah I mean you know I I don't know if I Would die I hesitate even to say they're really good if you're basically healthy um because the reality as we all know is that you're healthy until you're not healthy\nRight right well I should have said John who was there ... there are less expensive as you're healthy\nAbsolutely and look if you if you're healthy right now and you buy one of these and you know you you go through the year or however long you hold U.S policy and you don't get a serious illness and you don't break your arm and you know you don't have a kid born with a congenital disease and yeah you know you look at your bank balance than at the end of the year you'll have more money um\nBut you know that's that that's that's a that's a that's a roll the dice and it's a big roll the dice and the thing is you know look I cover this is my beat right healthcare I mean I've been writing about this for almost Twenty years right now I get I can I went through one of these policies and the guy and I don't understand all the exclusions\nUm I I there's just no way people buying these policies most of them really understand what they're getting and in part because most people in their heads they know that Obamacare is still the law they know the Affordable CARE Act is still there\nSo there's an assumption that you know if you buy insurance is going to cover what you need and you know the plan\nTo have to have a disclaimer and it's in the fine print but I can tell you I even got a telemarketing call from one of these companies and I can tell you it's very confusing and I I'm willing to bet money that a huge number of people find names won't know what they're getting and that's not pure conjecture because in the old days that used to happen\nAll the time insurance commissioners will get flooded with complaints\nSo let's talk about the president's ah that that was published in USA Today on Wednesday today\nAnd it's been slam hum by a lots of fact checkers and other folks as being filled with false hood and mischaracterization that some might even say lives but in his\nOp ed he slammed the Democrats were taking away health care and trying to turn America into Venezuela and in and he also claimed that he wants to protect people with preexisting condition um\n... what's really what is the president's record on that\nYeah I I you know that's a total lie I mean I I don't really know how to say and um I actually try not to use the word lie except in cases where I think someone actually actually know that they're not telling the truth is deliberately missing the people and I think this is one of those cases um\nYou know a President Trump spent last year trying to push through that repeal legislation and repeal legislation would have undermined the existing protections for pre existing conditions now it had some features in there that you know they threw when if you may remember\nBack when when they were writing the bill that said well you know we'll have a special provision you know for example won't actually let insurance companies deny coverage because of a preexisting condition but you know they would still let you know it you know they would let in certain cases they will let insurance charge more right\nSo yeah you have diabetes and\nThey can't deny you coverage but they can charge you a lot more for it so much they couldn't afford it so that's you know that's effectively the same thing I mean can you talk to any expert they will tell you can't have just one piece of the pre existing protections you have to have them all together\nSo you know that's what he was doing last year and now this year I didn't mention we were just talking about the junk insurance a regulation that undermines protections for pre existing conditions but there's even more crystal clear example which is there's this lawsuit down in Texas\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you in all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nFull legal expert who think it has things that has any merit\nBut there's a lawsuit that was filed by some conservative Republican state officials\nCalling on the federal courts to throw out a the protections for pre existing conditions and normally in normal times when someone sues uh just clear federal law unconstitutional the Justice Department defense that law in court and doesn't matter whether the administration likes it or not that's\nThe way the system works at the Justice Department it's unless you know allies like agree just fully unconstitutional you you defended the Trump Administration\nYou know this is the Trump Administration they don't do things like people usually do it they just had a nope we're gonna we're not only we are not only will we not defend the law we're going to file a brief in support of the point that so they are the Trump Administration right now has its name on a lawsuit asking\nA federal judge to throw out the protections for pre existing condition so I don't know how you can have your name on that lawsuit and then get up and you know USA Today or what you know Fox News or wherever and say hey I Want to protect\nPreexisting conditions I mean this is just you know this is crazy\nWell let's talk about the politics of what happened today in in the Senate\nOr not only in the United states around the world because if the central bank is not independent or its its independence is questioned even if it is independent people don't believe it\nAnd you run the risk of people thinking that inflation is going to grow um that there will be pressure on the fed to keep rates low just like Trump wants them to do\nUm and that ... ... again people will respond to those expectations and and you can't keep inflation under control this isn't a very bad news for Trump to the job on the facts\nAre we we've got to take a break will probably come back to this at another time when we return more with our panel and more of your calls at ... for for seven four five eight to five five you're listening

radio stations across the country this is a show about politics in the mid term elections and\nNow the election day is twenty seven days away we want to check in on key races here what the candidates are talking about and share some of their notable commercials still with me in Studio to do that are Brian Lehrer hosted the Brian Lehrer show and WNYC\nAnd Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell before we jump into calls and commercial Brian you want it in on what we were talking about in the ... at the very end of the last of segment about the fed and the president attacking the fed to things\nI think that the tension that's going on in the markets right now shows how the interests of workers and the interest of owners are sometimes at odds and raises the question which one is the government including the said I'm going to favor this happened back in the nineties as well unemployment would go down\nThe fed would raise interest rates so that unemployment didn't go down\nTo quickly uh and spark inflation and progressive at that time what how all at the fed for raising rates because it was like the fed Alan Greenspan in those days wanted enough unemployment why does he want workers to be out of jobs that's not progressive\nAnd if we're looking at Trump now putting pressure politically on the fed is hardly unique I pulled out this article from Nineteen Ninety three just as Bill Clinton was taking office\nFor the New York times and it says Mr Clinton and the governors of the fed or on a collision course because of the central bank wants to economic growth to continue its slow takeoff hoping to keep inflation heading down or the Mr Clinton's advisors have a quite different goal for faster economic growth\nTo fulfill his campaign pledge sound familiar\nYeah but I mean I don't know where we did you say that President Clinton did President Clinton directly attack the fed\nNow it was it was Leon Panetta with one of his official right as a job that sort of move yeah with who job on the fed and he was on largely um\nAdmonished for that by economists than other she said we again we need the fed to maintain it credibility\nIt has been ... hard won credibility one over the decades and you can make that disappear quite quickly if you don't believe that the fed is independent if you believe that the fed is subject to the day to day political when\nI'm Out of the populace and can be sort of strong arm into doing what politically expedient for the guy in the White House so actually after that those comments were made\n'em and I think Panetta actually make a couple of times um there was some sort of rule implemented within the White House saying\nOkay from now on we are not going to publicly comment on fad policy now or the value of the dollar and various other things said [laughter]\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you in all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nHave stepped down there happened deviation including many Maurice\n... as you were speaking Edith Bunker singing those were the days was rolling through my head\nThat's going back to the question that I asked our listeners at the beginning of the show does Medicare for all seem like a good idea or one of those too good to be true promises that politicians can't really deliver on ask you to call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five ban in West Chester thank you for calling into America on the line [noise]\nHi how are you can you hear me yes I can\nOkay thanks for taking my call I think that I have free points out I'll Try to be quick one I think it's funny that this has\nBecome such a partisan issue I mean we have the right that's very far or against it in the left is it's for it in France my wife is from France my son was born in France it's not a right or left issue you can be very far away and an anti immigration anti euro zone 'em but your love your health insurance you that that's something that they can agree on\nAnd I know that this was going to sound bad but I'm sure we were to kind of ... down Americans' throats so to speak and universal healthcare which is something that we accepted\nLike you go to church on Sunday and when you're Twenty one is a tricky thing we can continue to fight about everything from immigration and abortion and gun control but we will have this thing that really works very well we have an example of that\nUh the second point is that a is a law suits on the medical insurance so what happens in\nIn France when my son was works I had a son born here and Francis on\nA born in uh in New York a midwife delivered a my son they don't have an OBGYNs see the thing the philosophy and the French system if you will see Trump you try to provide the best quality care at\nThe cheapest price having an OBGYN there is a very uh extensive we have more C sections in ... in America than we do in France why because people are afraid of getting suit my son was very sick the other day he was like vomiting a lot the doctor said okay just taken here\nI got chickens we are that might be expensive why did the doctors say that because of one percent chance that something bad happens to my son he's going against suits that just doesn't work that way than with ... [laughter]\nYeah so the third point is a small business owner\nAnd what you do you hire and fire people big deals you have insurance do you offer insurance in my school district I send my kids to bed for central school district they had the great idea to do insurance in house in other words they said we have a big enough pool of teachers that were just going to kind of do our own insurance what happened a couple of teachers got very sick or they had cancer\nOr prices skyrocketed and now I literally have to pay more taxes if people don't understand the effects of this there are companies that large companies like it was American Airlines recently that the legacy that they have to pay for older people the pensioners are not who no longer work for them I don't think that universal healthcare is good\nFor business and it's not good for individuals skews me out of the current system\nBanned I I Want to thank you very much you get [laughter]\nBeen gone for a lot of material Brian Catherine dive in\nWell my two kids were both delivered by midwives\nWith the doctor on call if something went wrong and it was better for humanity a kind of you know human scale with my wife and me and it was cost effective so I support the story that he told with respect to France but\nOn the larger point there's a basic tension in health care economics whether you go liberal or conservative that there is so much medical technology available in the modern world\nWe could spend an infant and the amount of money to cover everyone for everything so every society ration health care\nBut you can laugh at like Canada or I guess France where basically everyone is covered for all the same things and they have to decide how much they're willing to be taxed\nVersus how much they're willing to go without for the most part you know everybody gets to the same things are denied the same things preexisting conditions is not an issue because everyone is just covered\nIn this country there is a tension between these two ideals that the two parts\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools and as a creative non fiction writer and rolling no for August twenty seventh applications a pest dot edu\nIf you require insurance companies to charge everybody the same price and for insurance and ... to cover all sorts of conditions and as a candidate at the very least a you know these essential health benefits\nUm and not turn people away\nFor having a healthcare problems that that can end up itself not necessarily solve the problem because if you don't require people to buy insurance only the people who need insurance by it to help the people don't buy it and then the prices just spiral out of control so I I think you need those protections are people but you also need requirements that people buy insurance\nIs Catherine Rampell Brian Lehrer thanks so much for being here tonight I'm we're going to play that Ted Cruz and one of these days the really funny one that people can talk about we have to take a short break and when we returned foreign policy is a political issue too isn't it you're listening to America on the line\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the N.

thoughts on this question does it really matter to you if America is no longer the global leader it's been for Seventy years do you like the administration stated\nPolicy of America First call us at eight for for seven and four or five talk eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five our next guest has a great deal to say about America's leadership role in the world Robert Kagan is a columnist for the Washington Post a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of the jungle grows back America and our imperiled world Bob welcome to America\nOn the line thanks for having me well I'm\nI Am thrilled to have you on a and especially to talk about your book because one it's terrific and it is a great history lesson\nTo sort of remind people of uh we're how the United states became the so called leader of the free world and I want to I Want you to explain what you mean by the jungle grows back and I want you to expand\nOn on this one line that's on page nine of your of your book you say that the creation of the liberal order has been an act of defiance against both history and human nature\nTalk more about that\nWell sure I mean you know if you think about the great a sweep of human history uh most people have lived under tyranny in poverty and in the state of constant warfare that's pretty much the story of humankind going back as far as recorded\nHistory and I'm sure back before that as well um and the period that we've been living in since the end of World War two a has been entirely different that's been a time of incredible prosperity we've seen for a million people move out of poverty into the middle class\nOr it's been a period of incredible explosion of democracy like the world has never seen before and it's also\nA been a period of great power peace we didn't have the kind of world wars that we saw 'em in the first half of the twentieth century so it's an extraordinary period but we have to understand that historically it's an aberration\nUm and the point I Want to make is that it really requires active efforts stain it because nature in a sense\nA loss to tear it down in the international system of the national order is chaos and conflict um and you know human beings don't necessarily go toward democracy so this is something that requires active efforts we've done it for a long time and we need to continue to work at it\nIn fact you write if the liberal order is like a garden artificial and forever threatened by the forces of nature preserving it requires a persistent\nAnd ending struggle against the vines and weeds that are constantly working to undermine their from within and overwhelm it\nFrom from with out of you know later on in the book you talk about the fact that you know Americans actually question why their country needs to be so deeply involved in the rest of the world this is something that while President Trump ran on that you know in America first agenda\nThis that sentiment predates President Trump doesn't it it does I think\nEver since the end of the Cold War I think Americans have been asking why they need to shoulder this enormous burden of\nOf sort of maintaining peace and prosperity and the liberal world order and it's not surprising that they would because it really is an unusual role of no country in history has ever played it before and I think most people thought that when the Soviet Union collapsed that they really we really didn't have to continue doing that\nI'm a unfortunately the sad reality is is we're seeing all around us the jungle does grow back there all kinds of bad actors out there and if the United states does not continue to play this role then eventually the jungle overwhelms us and even overwhelms Americans\nAre one of the things that you and I've talked about this before [noise] excuse me and you've talked about the fact that um the United states ... ... at least within the last Seventy years it has not banned\nStreaming of the wing length public radio is funded by you and small ones from a certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farms down small ones farm dot com\nNormal nation is a nation that looks after itself first and really only most nations in the history have looked after their own security and their own economic well being and I had not taken\nResponsibility for a larger world order and the key word here is responsibility you know people talk about Americans being isolationists they're not isolationist they're\nAlways heavily involved in the world the question is\nDo they want to take responsibility for maintaining a certain kind of order and I think that is the great challenge and it it it does require\nAll it's costly if it costs lives and it also has a moral burden because when you exercise power it's impossible not to exercise that to some degree a morally it's the nature of exercising power so it's entirely understandable that Americans would want us to look\nOffload this responsibility unfortunately the world is considered on such a way\nThat if Americans do offload that responsibility than we had\nBack towards chaos and disorder and tyranny and all the things that we saw\nBefore the United states began playing this role\nNow you write towards the middle of the book about how there are rules of the road here with this a liberal small D democratic uh order that um we've been living under for for Seventy years and that basically it's a sense of fairness\nUm that even though the United states is the a military power and and and an economic ... power by and large it doesn't use its power to run roughshod over other members of the of the global order do I have that right\n[noise] yeah so ... and I want to ... to to uh make clear that that doesn't mean the United states doesn't sometimes take advantage of its power doesn't mean we're not selfish that doesn't mean we're not had the critical it doesn't mean we don't make terrible mistakes because where humans and that's just the nature of these the by and large\nThe order we created in order to be successful\nHad to be one in which the other members felt that they were getting a fair shake that we weren't exploiting are enormous power to sort of get it over on them and when every deal I mean we allowed Germany\nTo do better than we were doing in the production of automobiles we allowed Japan to do better than we were doing in some areas of technology at one time or another and that was part of the deal in a way Japan and Germany gave up their geopolitical ambitions which is led the two world wars and an exchange they were allowed to thrive economically\nUm so they made the deal only works if if if there is a kind of a level playing field in the economic realm especially\nNow when when you and I talked to a for my contacts with the Washington Post earlier this year you said something that I found a intriguing you said when President Obama ran and was elected he correctly believe that the American people wanted to kind of retrenchment of American involvement in the world and he carried that\nKeep Republicans keep

transracial adoption and and her search for her identity and what difference it made her when she actually sought out the truth of the story of her biological family were one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nUh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life\n[noise] um but but there's just the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think\nPart of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not opened up of adopted children mind you but and I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race\nI mean thinking about that from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is um I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just\nThings I Wish I had in my ... but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way it information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with them about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nThat maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you ask many questions just nobody really was telling them either some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nTalk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to ... to have those conversations I think okay\nNow so I can hear a fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about a was with something to difficult enough to handle 'em or no one knew what to do with her how to come through that\nBut in addition to that ... was there was there all along and that you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an empty nest or something that you felt that needed to be filled because of\nYou know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're complex and as you saw with your parents\nYeah I think it was it wasn't so much an empty necessarily I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly um I in a way I got used to be like one of the fee or one of the only ones\nStreaming of New England public radio was willing to go you all energy solar hoping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nUm I don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about it it was sort of like when I left my home town it\nHad a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt that I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers to what may have finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced that I would've actually search no matter what you know it's not something I have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered\nUm I had gotten a little bit of information that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names no addresses but like general very general information\nI got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve um but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting\nAt um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and you and I don't know I had no answers it was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and childbirth it just\nI don't know something about my ... knowing my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah my first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and it can only those questions really become far more acute when there's so many\nOn answered a issues in in the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers

children and blended families\nFor more than Thirty years a note Nicole just I Wonder if you could just\nBriefly tell us what happened when you finally we're reconnected with your with your biological family because I imagined that growing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know it was that that that I deal wasn't wasn't fully realized\nI mean it's all in danger idealized and people you've never met [laughter] I'm In a lot of ways it it really was died of a ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is for the bar you in a university graduate schools ... enrolling for October ... applications a pest dot edu\nHated it um and it was interesting you know I\nI hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective and what it must have been like like what factors could have led to the adoption that was something\nI guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them up maybe emotional maturity or knowledge of the world to really consider what they might have gone through I was not expecting to find\nYou know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adoption you know things that were just difficult that they were dealing with um that you know this might have been factors in the adoption certainly that weren't like directly caused by it for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them and I did so via a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed in at the time I search to had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identifying information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer um but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd I'm so there's like two different reunions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one and like not easily I had always pictured like talking with and meeting them or reconnecting with him at least like together\nSo that was I was interested I was my first surprise um and what I found initially or was that they hadn't never told my sister my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed and they'd never been told about the adoption they'd been told I died at birth\nAnd right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a it was a whole family is sort of reconnection ... as I mentioned segmented into like different different branch um that was it was unexpected\nWhoa I mean so Joyce adoptions are so complicated right because you're dealing with the lives of the the lives of so many people at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that\nThat her biological parents hadn't even told there are other children I mean how how do you would\n... I don't know how long is that unusual no really\nIsn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment birth parents get the least\nAnd they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so at this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean him this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every story is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sisters did ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did the process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family did it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications that they passed dot edu I think\nThe primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched or just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about\n'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family that was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is\nOne of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister's especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information I'm In a she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand on these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please Phil and medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that\nSo but Cindy Cindy was and this is her family family the only ones you've got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answered\nAnd that was how I began to learn more and fill in those gaps and knowledge [laughter]\nWell this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives

tell him\nJoyce you have an answer for John well I you know they're at the huge question but one of the answers is to make sure you around yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American\nUm you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for role models for him and that you look for\nFor you ah you know the best people to help you

excitement around immunological therapies\nFor treating cancer and we're joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in physiology or Medicine He's Jim Alison and he shares that award with ... of Kyoto University his work in cancer immunotherapy was recognized by the Nobel Committee this year and ... and his also\nChair of the department of immunology at Mt Cancer Center\nAnd I want to bring in another voice into the conversation or Mr Alison if I could joining us now is Dr Monica ... she is president of the American society for Clinical Oncology she's also chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center\nAnd professor of surgery at Harvard Harvard Medical school as well and she joins us today from Washington just for Britain usually walk into on point\nI make great to be here it's great to have you know you you heard Jim Alison describes his research and also a you know meeting the first patient that he had he had met one on one who had undergone immunotherapy for her cancer\nA really moving story but I'm sure if you could sort of described from the point of view of as a fellow researcher so sort of how revolutionary is it that that were sinking or focusing so much on using the immune system rather than external chemicals for treating cancer\nWell you know there is nothing more exciting I'm a biologist researchers in our field than to see something some understanding from human biology finally revealed that we can really use it to help patients and that was an incredibly moving story that you know fortunately we're hearing lots of these stories and\nYou know that it was it's a couple of decades now in the early nineties that um there was a first clue that the immune system could do this um [noise]\nThere was some work done by Steven Rosenberg at the national Cancer Institute where he found that giving um natural drugs called cytokines that could really jazz up the immune system\nCould really read eliminate tumors in patients with melanoma in Reno cancers and and you know it was it was just a glimmer of that this might be possible\nAnd then it took decades of really careful work in the laboratory and understanding the biology to really make this something that can help patients and so it's just wonderful to see the Nobel Prize awarded in this field and even better to see this brand new tool that we have to fight cancer\nNow or are we are talking about treatments and fighting cancer here is anyone thinking that you may know therapy might lead down to the root of a cure\n[noise] so we do see some purists from him you know therapy what is cure mean you know to to clinicians cure means you have someone who has a tumor\nAnd your ... somehow something we can do is able to eliminate that tumor and they it doesn't come back in their body um that's what we mean by cure and some of these initial immunotherapy is perhaps the patient that Dr Alison just described\nShe lived her entire lifetime with\nDreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nCautious in using the cure word but what really matters to patients is that they live a long long life and never have the burden of cancer in their life so that's what we're seeing and we're seeing that with him you know therapy okay\nA gym Alison let me let me turn back to you here I mean that was what do you what do you think about what Dr ... has said is it or we should we be talking about potential cures\nWas you know for a long time it's been considered ... program and appropriate to use words treasure ... for ... and early ...\nMelanoma Persians to receive a repeat of them are just as a single ... single round of treatments for directions for over twenty percent of them are a lot at least two years after a string of treatments are\n... after a time people to\nQuit looking over their shoulder every religion I'm Wondering if some judges looming for them or down and move on them and that's what makes me so happy about the sure about Sherman's experience because she was told bird positions don't cover the children after off our shoes or none of them are more troops are normal life\nYeah oh Monica Britain usually uh I mean how many immunotherapy is our ... are out there right now well\nWe have um Fifteen cancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using him you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally thousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drugs agents approaches\nThat are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field and it's just been blown wide open by\nA by the proof of principle that untangling this biology can have a true transformative effect on patients lives and I've just been hearing a landslide two thousand currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different ... different components of the immune system um are all undergoing clinical testing across the world\nAnd when's the last time cancer research has seen that kind of explosion in potential therapy is\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of ah industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nI mean I Wonder if I ... I Would I Want to just\nInject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago\nThere was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman research and Andrew genesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting line of research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example\nUm you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things that I'm sure Dr Alison can will time in here too is that that work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Allison's group has developed with a with came out of his work and\nThe combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it was activating the taking the breaks off that the south is produced", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "11"}
