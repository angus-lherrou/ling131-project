that will shape our next two years Missouri Nevada\nAnd New Jersey but first a quick update on the news of the day this afternoon President Trump acknowledge the Saudi journalist the Washington Post columnist Jim ... is likely dead he said the evidence seems indicate that the show he was murdered but stopped short of blaming the Saudi crown prince and he made the comments to the New York times\nAnd they quoted him as saying of Saudi Arabia\nThey've been a good ally and they bought massive amounts of various things in investments in this country which I appreciate and meanwhile let them are potent is weighing in on this ... the U.S bears a certain responsibility and he wonders why the Saudis\nHaving been punished as the Russians were for alleged use of chemical weapons so what kind of being fooled by Vladimir Putin's\nAnd tonight ABC News reports a crucible that secretary of state Mike Pompeo was played that tape of ... being murdered and was given a transcript of it by Turkish officials State Department denied that he had heard that tape but did not address whether he had read the transcript of the recording\nAnd meanwhile the Dow Jones filling a three hundred pounds today after dropping eight hundred points in a single day last week\nAnd if there's an October surprise for voters it just might be what's happening to their four one K. this month\nAnd the Republican Party survey by the polling from public opinion strategies which was leaked to Bloomberg Businessweek\nFinds that the upcoming election is mostly not about the economy jobs trade or any other issue the report says research indicates the determining factor in this election is how voters feel about President Trump\nAnd that's our question for you tonight is your vote whoever you're voting for or against it meant to be a referendum on Donald Trump and\nEasy to his policies or his tone is personality that you aren't reacting to so when you go to the polls are you voting for or against Donald Trump even though he's not on the ... give us a call\nAid for for seven four or five park that's aid for for seven four or five eighty two fifty five and you can also send us a tweet using the hash tag eight O P L okay\nIf get started with our battle ground field reports we have three reporters standing by the update us on the campaigns in their states three fascinating states we'll hear from New Jersey\nWhere there are some races the Democrats hope will be the key to flipping the house then we're going to go to Missouri for an update on the Senate race between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and a Republican challenger Josh Hawley and finally to Nevada where there is a tight Senate race between incumbent Republican Dean Heller and Democrats Jackie rose and we're going to stop\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed to the installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nYou live in the studio right now so thanks for coming in to push it it can shoot near the what is the state of the race in the Garden State lots of bugs that Bob Menendez might be in trouble where we're at tonight well\nHe's he's still somewhere around ten points up on his challenger Republican ... who's a pharmaceutical executive um some polls have had him down into single digits but he he's been depending on the poll bouncing around I think ah from all that I've looked at Democrats are\nLikely to hold their noses and vote for him because they are concerned about Donald Trump and um you know the the biggest problem the Democrats face with Bob Menendez\nBesides the fact that they didn't offer up a candidate to primary him when they should have is that\nThe Democratic seats in the house that are up for reelection aren't competitive races so your ... your democratic strongholds in the state aren't going to see the kind of turnout that we're going to see in the five Republican held districts where the turnout is you know they're expecting a democratic surge\nAnd so that's gonna hurt Menendez but uh I think when all is said and done I think he's going to get out\nOkay well I Want to come back for more details because this has really turned into a a nasty race even even buying New Jersey standards let's go to Missouri now an Allison ... of the Kansas City star or thanks for joining us Allison appreciate it\nThanks for having me well let's talk about what's going on in in in Missouri right now I'm Claire McCaskill always seems to be in sort of apparel is you know the perils of Pauline always seems to be waging uphill fight 'em how she faring as of right now [noise]\nRight well Missouri is a state that voted for president Donald Trump by something like Nineteen point so um it's a difficult state for a Democrat to win a says one of the most important Senate races in the country one of the closest Senate races in the country I'm In right now it looks like an absolute toss up the cook Political Report has that has a toss up the last poll I saw\nHad Holly ... polling at forty five and McCaskill at forty four\nInterestingly in that poll they asked undecided voters are voters that didn't answer where they were leaning and got the exact same answer Holly forty five McCaskill forty four\nSo it's a very very tight race um and pretty much every poll that we've seen is within the margin of error um it's also one of the most expensive Senate races this cycle out of the center for Responsive Politics had as a second overall most expensive race and the most expensive race in terms of outside spending\nAnd the closer we get to election day I'm the nasty or it gets you know we've got just an onslaught of political ads the ads against Holly or calling him you know a lot of climbing politician and the geo piece golden boy\nThey've been going after him over health care\nAnd the ads against one call a McCaskill are accusing her being out of touch with Missouri\nI'm Holly campaign of trying to pin McCaskill two Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi um he's been on a stop Schumer fire Claire to wear and his campaign bus has um himself on obviously and then McCaskill Schumer and Pelosi\nAnd of course now we have an undercover video which apparently we can't have a campaign without one of those so\nI was more to come back to the zoo and just just a moment and finally I Want to go out to a Las Vegas in the ... of the Nevada independent um look I mean there are a lot of states that have crazy politics but ah I mean you're right up there [laughter] and I want\nTo that one of the crazier states to cover that's for sure but yeah we have one of that one of the craziest Senate race in the cycle I'm Andrew governor's race was pretty nuts to it\nOur governor's races crazy too yeah we have quite quite a lot going on out here in in the west [laughter]\nOkay we're talking about let's talk about the Senate race because all I think a lot of Democrats thought that the incoming Republican Dean Heller was dead men walking that this was the number one and number two biggest pickup prospect\nFor them um ... the last poll I saw would suggest that ... is is the head or even but what are you looking at\nRight so a lot of the whole set by the cycle of really had that candidate you know ... ... ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was going to go you know all the energy solar hoping homes businesses owned firms in western New England SUV motor ... was solar power all energy solar dog ...\n... there was one poll recently were held there was a little bit ahead but everyone on the ground here really things it's still a toss up you know this could go either direction but like you mentioned\nYou know Heller was considered the most vulnerable or won't have a role in our little Republican and the Senate and and he still is by he's actually been able to get around some of the issues that were really big Thornton aside at the beginning of the campaign one of the big issues that Jackie rather than who is a political newcomer\nShe the first time Congress woman she was recruited by Harry Reid to run for the house and twenty sixteen she doesn't have a lot of experience but she's been going after Heller really hard\nOn health care um Heller was one of those\nSenators came out initially when Senate Republicans were debating repealing and replacing\nThe Affordable CARE Act and said you know no I have some concerns about this but then he eventually voted for that motion to proceed voted for the skinny repeal of the Affordable CARE Act to get rid of the individual mandate so Jacky Rosen thing going after him saying you know you flip flopped on the Affordable CARE Act she's been running these really memorable ad\nFeaturing the orange inflatable to man the kind of thing you see outside the car repair shop that sort of I come here a type deal she's been running ads accusing him of being senator spine left but the thing he's been blowing with the winds of Washington and that sort of been her biggest attack against him is that he's caved\nAnd the um the holes in for that and how old's on legislation and that and the judges and they seem to Sherry and that's why I Want to keep Bob Menendez\nIn there at least ... one more Democrats on the Democratic side and not let the conservative majority that has such a chokehold on the federal government and the bureaucracy in stronger so fond I'm a very pragmatic in the city I'm voting\nFor I think maybe for the call and then that's what you were describing a little bit before Nancy that that was the quarter the real politics are you seeing from a lot a lot of voters I'm\nJust an a you know thanks to all three of you for being you're in a miracle on long we have to go to a break and when we come back how much money to the Saudis released spend them the United

Sharon her most recent book is sex matters\nAnd it does doesn't it more [laughter] I think so either I'm somewhere where should we begin and we we we have so much you know town you don't want I Want to start with something that I'm slowly obsessed about\nI'm a little bit obsessed about a story that I don't think he's getting um is getting as much attention as the law to\nSteve King Republican congressman from Iowa for reasons best known to him so\nJust decided to endorse a candidate for mayor in Toronto who is I was on a show a little bit earlier the today show was described as a white nationalist which does not really captured\nUm faith goldie is really somebody to flirt with neo Nazis she was fired from her very right wing website job because she insisted on going on the Daily Stormer I mean this is somebody who ... the infamous fourteen words\nAnd yet for some reason\nThis doesn't seem to be generating the kind of reaction that you would have I think in other news cycles given Steve kings prominence in in in Republican politics and in in in Congress and I'm certainly not seeing and I I maybe I missed it but I don't see\nComments from other Republicans around the country saying I'm this is beyond the pale so motor we'll start with you on all of this um\n... Steve King is and if we could go through all the things that that faith goldie stands for but I mean here you have a senior Republican member of Congress who is essentially endorsing a neo Nazi\nAnd it can sit and listen to the other things that we've known about Steve King over the years he's made other comments that were really a disgraceful [laughter]\nUm but you know he's he has an opponent and\nHis opponent jade de ... not very much political experience perhaps but he's gotten a ton of money from people who find um king offensive and I'm I'm waiting I looked on line I haven't seen the ads highlighting this latest outrage from a\nFrom a Steve King from his opponent I Would expect that would be the first place to start the voters of I don't know what's going on but\nAlso I Would expect that there would be people calling up other Republicans saying what do you think about this so what are what\nTo capitalize wanna get your your your take on I ... I have a theory this kind of depressing but you have a cat or any explanation of this will be depressing look Trump has been flirting with neo Nazis or for the last couple of years are starting at least with when he initially did not just on the endorsements\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOver to the window at this point I I think is is sadly a little ridiculous right like we have become accustomed to the\nVets exactly that's exactly what my theory was going to be that\nThat having seen all the things that were considered quote unquote acceptable or two years ago that we have in fact move the window of acceptability that was something that would have been a massive controversy just a couple of years ago is is not and apparently\nIt and it doesn't appear to shock the conscience of of Republicans who apparently had been in a word to this kind of you know hyper ...\nAnd I also agree with that and it's sort of on brand in some sense Steve King in particular\nMaria it's the normal life you know the normalizing of it right it's it's absolutely the number of it the normalizing of it um regarding Steve King I'm I was recently in his district about a year ago that somewhat recent in political terms um he's his district is majority Latino in Iowa\nMajority Latino residents I Know your eyes are pie I had not not voters but in terms of you know the fastest growing demographic in Iowa hello Latinos and letting us\nJust in terms of context by the way I also met a Latino there who was pro Trump so just a little bit of context but in terms of\nWhat I'm ... this notion of a it's it's normalizing white supremacy now on the other side you know before you could not say the word white supremacy without just just\nThis kind of horror of people like we have to talk about white supremacy we have to talk about what it looks like structurally and what this raises is precisely the question that you're asking Charlie why is it that people are not speaking out about you let me\nRespond to that I don't disagree with you but I think that\nIt that often in terms of racism and which ones are thrown around so much that people have a nominee effect so that when the real thing I mean you're talking about an actual neo Nazi white nationalist comes along\nThat we don't we don't calibrate our responses in the in the same way because this is I mean this was this is something that that ought not to be you know not to be controversial is not close call here\nWhen I don't think the problem is that we're too quick to call the\nNow I I really don't and and and frankly that like\nPeople don't walk around throwing the term white supremacy I'm a journalist I have an analysis I'm looking at things structurally I'm hearing what people are saying most people are not out there saying that so I I Want to caution about well everybody's kind of an ... I don't agree\nI'd I disagree with my esteem colleagues on this I actually think that there has been a a permit skinless uses terms like white supremacy\nAnd racism over the years and I think even some you know conscientious liberals have acknowledged it in the era of Trump and said you know we called\nMitt Romney racist and we called John McCain or racist and that was unjust and you know we regret it now because now we really need the term to have the same moral force a and it doesn't because there there's the boy who cried wolf problem and now there's a real wolf\nOkay well I Want to move on and we'll by so many things I'm I'm Sorry but I sort of brutal took us off on an on on on that direction um cat and I want to talk to you about the about money and what about the the Saudi money issue this obsession that Donald Trump has with how much economic value the Saudi Arabian connection has for us\nAnd ... and to tell me about that and and how\nDeeply it appears to be influencing the administration's response to the brutal murder of ...\nI Would say that the United states has always had to some extent a naked like transactional relationship with the Saudis but\nTo Trump that's like a virtue right\nMeat and he he sort of believes that the fact that he doesn't prioritize American values that instead he prioritizes American economic interests are financial interest that's a good thing and you know a lot of supporters believe that as well I mean they they said he's not eating illogical that's a great thing he can make great deals for us well he's focusing on the great deal he's not focusing on\nStreaming of New England public radio was ... all the energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThe kind of money that is being spent now in this ice industrial complex I think might be a place where we think okay well how about cuts here I mean that's pie and this guy but I'm just saying if people buy into these policies [noise]\nThis is at great cost to the American economy\nDisorders we don't have the wall but I'm but I'm not sure that that's going to solve the problem and you know Kevin you had a piece today where you basically showed the fact that you know you at the economy growing in the deficit growing at the same time which is a nightmare scenario and I don't know where we're going here in foreign fortunately\nWould have to take a break here and we're going to be back with his panel I'm going to take a promise to take more of your calls in just a moment you're listening to America on the line [noise]\n\n\n\nNews throughout the day this is AM's exporting the N.

to and here's the question I mentioned this poll commissioned by Republicans that concluded that\nThis election is really not about the economy stupid it's not about other things it is about how people feel about President Trump's so do you agree\nOr they're in a positive or negative way would you vote are you voting for or against Donald Trump or is there another reasons you can call it an aid for for seven four or five talk that aid for for seven four or five eighty two fifty five\nOkay just the question with his family in me to hear\nHow do you think it is that the Republicans work the Kavanaugh's confirmation or how they flipped the script on this how does it become a story about mob rule smear tactics and and the and the smearing of of an innocent man well Christine Blasey Ford\nWho everybody said was credible and compelling when she was testified has really just disappeared as a factor I mean it is being a couple of weeks and that almost seems to be invisible so I mean ... this is this how Republicans win the battle is no more I I Know you may have a different perspective on all of this\n[noise] yes I um I actually think this was ... on the part of the Democrats um they piled on too much they embraced um implausible and even outlandish accusations along with a serious accusation that his forwards and by so doing they diluted the strength of her\nAccusation and they allowed I'm both an Kavanaugh and other Republicans to say well the Democrats are just flinging all of this mud and they and Michael ... was a gift to them [noise]\nUm so that they could then just say throw in the Ford accusation with the less credible ones and um and deny that any of them had credibility Jasmine\nI it's true if you had asked me a couple of months ago if I thought it would be good for Republicans to have their Supreme Court pick at credibly accused of sexual assault I would've said absolutely not no there's no conceivable universe in which this could be a political positive and clearly it has been it has become such a thing\nUm I think it's maybe partly that Democrats and you know did give too much weight to the to like the ... claim which had to walk back\nBut I think it's also that Republicans are just willing to play dirty or to some extent and Trump himself you know he was warned don't attack a lousy Ford's credibility don't attack her personally and initially he didn't\nBut it to some extent maybe it was the turning point that he went after her directly that he that he doesn't have any qualms about attacking a credible that can or sexual assault and and that somehow\nYou know I'm I think a lot of women I'm not sure what this is going to mean in terms of the midterms but I think there are a lot of women who are still\nStill kind of trying to catch up with what happened\nUm in terms of the nomination and confirmation of Kevin on um I mean it's still as I travel across the country since um since he's been confirmed I'm continuing to hear the same thing that women are still coming to terms with things that happened to them um and the kind of shock of it all and again the normalization of\nOf now justice Kavanaugh um but I think that how did this happen that the narrative shifted\nSo I'm ... again it brings me no joy to say these things but I think that um if you think about who is actually running America's newsrooms who has a kind of maybe and understanding of let's let's be concerned about the young men in the world America's newsrooms have become\nLess diverse since September eleventh ... they're not more diverse\nSo we have to think about how certain narratives are picked up and and that they become the central narrative which is now now that we have to be concerned about young men as opposed to what women are experiencing so I just I think in terms of a structural perspective\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local governance stolen roof ground amounts and do all

twenty eighth Nineteen sixty nine and now there's a new movie out of that largely focused on Neil Armstrong and it's based on the book first man the life of Neil Armstrong which has been written by James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and professor emeritus of history at Auburn\nUniversity a professor hands and I just want to hear a little bit from Neil Armstrong himself here because it back in two thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong at one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham I've a mess you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in La Crosse if something goes wrong somewhere to go back out actually wanted to ask you to lift off is really a big surprise [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five a Jim Hansen\nYou eat and you write in your book and the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character his demeanor and there's a boom in the book where\nYou write about why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on the moon and and not Buzz Aldrin and and if I got to have to ask if I had this right Chris craft to is the chief of flight operations in Houston said ah that Neal was Neal calm\nQuiet and absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meaning what\nWill they knew that [noise] that the the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who is going to become a global icon the one who stepped out and represent demanded to use the first step onto another heavenly body\nThat this was going to be a big deal they may imagined that up correctly\nAnd uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft ... corps and George Low who was a one of the big officials and the manned space program and Bob guild Ruth who was the director down in Houston it was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you don't find this in any records only an oral history coming from draft\n'em and and that was that they were having a discussion and they knew that this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that the person going out first asked Ron going out first would be based on really the interior lay out of the ... the way the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the ... and\nThat always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronaut says to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first because the way they had to open it would be difficult proposed to beat the first one out\nBut in truth this you know just meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know could could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense to what a you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong or but it was also kind of a comment on bus I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well and they knew he was a very very professional astronaut but they also knew that person\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nYou know he was there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's the commander of a ... eight\nWarm and made it very clear to me that he had told 'em um Dix lightened that he would not accept buzz on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a professional astronaut though they were just elements above his personality which were a little difficult\nAnd Neal can handle them a man and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic wow\nInteresting well let's step back in time considerably if we could tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years I see here that did you first start flying at the age of six\nAnd he took us at first airplane ride and lay right okay was sick I ain't got his pilot's license on the sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile he had little interest in automobiles which is kind of surprising for avoid back in that era but he had been become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did\nTo buy a model airplanes and he built in in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure\nI'm some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true I mean you don't need to get interested in that until much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career you know he may as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea then becoming a test pilot he really what led him to space was really not any you know Germany passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology at in in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night but he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying a or didn't fall but he was just hovering in\nHistory he he didn't have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um I mean there was a spiritual side to him but he wasn't the sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became\nAnd so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because you you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much fat you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of type of proto engineer looked at things\nThat he was saying like profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this in a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion floor space and space exploration necessarily that drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it with space that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he he growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation\nAnd of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights of that era of the post the pre World War two era and he kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter] course he didn't realize that there were all sorts of things yet to calm\nWell so campaigns and I

I really appreciate markets all do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell um it feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh everyone is going to be thinking in discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what\nJake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually give 'em\nA really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states a with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is us getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all those really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran or who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the u._s. got involved in other people's business wealth\nOr because to promote democratic ideals and to um to try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also save to live and be a dissident and express your views on to try to have word around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana a about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... regardless of how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic basis a moral basis very few people are going to vote on that a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line and the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ...

President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow of the shah in Iran and its evolution to fifteenth century theocracy a as described\nThere a couple of listeners weighing in I wanted to turn to another element of the midterm elections which was the question of turnout and particularly turned out to Latino voters\nDemocrats talk about this a lot I think are in Texas they had been staking at the idea that they do work would somehow benefit from that his\nHe is fluent in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are\nAre are said to be even though\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent ah Fernando ... how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that teen\nLatino turnout was very very lowest twenty seven percent and twenty six scene went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nPew um has a pure research Hispanic trends came out this week with their\nWith numbers on the you know a vote this chair they they are saying that there is a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low or in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas Beto O'Rourke probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough I'm interested in clay for instance Univision just a interviewed last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as though he always does with Spanish language media didn't and Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um they never likes to talk in Spanish and public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout was going to be traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week would there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection and they'll let teen vogue we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hinge on on the turnout\nAh Fernando or they're in a couple of other races that you would point to his ... in which do you think that's going to be politically important\nWell we have Florida ah and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I think the conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly and the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case [laughter] there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis on the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have

still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor Julian Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the midterms because numbers have shown that the rate is at what he said is not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that his campaign done six months before an election or by any one or two candidates you it's going to take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get all the animals registered and then the turn out to vote a\nAnd until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot of\nMargaret ... seems to me that almost every cycle we shared the importance of Latino voters in the idea there's going to be a surge but there is a even if there is greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually laughter in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know a everybody's asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be what about young voters typically in the past it's been very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I\nYou know I the the polling attempt to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday

again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... kind of a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... and I'm Andrea I lame on they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work
