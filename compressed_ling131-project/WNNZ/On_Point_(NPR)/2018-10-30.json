O T L\nJoining me now in the studio is Julian zealous or professor of history at Princeton University and co author of the upcoming book fault lines a history of the United states since Nineteen Seventy four professors sellers are generally and\nWelcome to American America America on the line thanks for having me here I'm actually I'm going to ask you about the the ... to quickly talk about what are the fault lines in America since since Seventy four do they lie on on\nPolitical issues are cultural issues all of them I mean we have big political ... which we talk about every day between the two parties where the center has disappeared\nAnd where their fundamental differences in terms of what the party's stand for and the kind of politics they practice there are social divisions are and even though many people are optimistic about what they see at home or in their community\nOn big questions about gender about race about immigration I think we have a kind of pretty big ah areas of separation that had been growing for decades at this point and that's why they're so hard to resolve\nA and then in the economy we have literal division a of economic wealth and economic well being and that's the problem of inequality that we talk about the thinning of the middle class\nAnd the growth of of wealthier Americans and lower class Americans with as many divisions that are circulating that play into moments like these\nSo on on Saturday President Trump said quote you wouldn't think this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR are done that\nUm the murders in in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh and and I'm asking this question because I Want you to talk about anti Semitism in the early twentieth century and white terms like nationalist and nativist our dog whistles\nOh sure anti Semitism has a long history in this country even though sometimes ah people forget just how bad it was the turn of the twentieth century\nOr you had first nativism which was this ah attack on immigration was often aimed at Jews or Eastern European Jews coming into this country\nThey were often the targets and the rhetoric was horrendous about the character of Jews and about\nUnsavory elements of the Jewish community this was used to close the borders are essentially to shut down the entrance of immigration and then nationalism obviously are in the United states and then in Europe in the Nineteen thirties\nWas connected often to isolating marginalizing Jews as the enemy of the people\nAre meaning the enemy of of the nation and that term directly connected to Nazi isn't the fascism and so and that term is invoked or it means a lot it carries a lot of weight to the president is right in terms of learning from the past but question if is if if he's learned from the past it off\n... at a at a rally I Believe it was ... it was last week or maybe it was the week before last at all runs together but he's stood on stage and said flat out\nI'm a nationalist and a lot of people freaked out and and lost their minds and I'm sure there were a lot of people around the country who we thought well what's the big deal as he explained he use about\n... he's about America and America First and America First is a dog whistle\nSure America First comes out of the Nineteen thirties it was a isolationist movement to keep the United states out of war Charles Lindbergh the famous aviator with the spokes person\nAnd it was anti cinematic very often including Lindbergh or with an admiration for the Nazis so even the term America First which people now\nIt's kind of common place it has a pretty powerful history and I'm not sure the president as being totally straight or I don't think he has I think he understands these votes certain things in the policy and I think he's trying to capitalize on this for his own political benefit\nOf this actually gets to question I was going to ask you a about something that you wrote last week in the Atlantic where you wrote quote the president has built his approach around as simple proposition Republicans will always come home and at the president President Trump has tested this approach\nTwice now ... can you break that down for us and in your answer talk about what it means when the republic when Republicans come home\nBased on language that is mired in fear and have and bigotry\nSo the the basic argument was we we are we are very polarized country and social scientists argue that Republicans have actually become more polarized they're more ideologically a homogeneous they're more loyal to the party than Democrats there's less division\nAnd this is a phenomenon that's been developing he understands this and he is not trying to unite the other side he's not trying to win over voters from the other side he's trying to solidify\nHis standing with in the Republican Party and he's counting on the fact that in the end and he's not wrong Republicans won't vote for Democrats they will come back so you do everything possible to build your own coalition rather than to expand it\nAnd I think part of that is appealing to extremist elements are and he's he's trying to get them to turn out by talking about immigration restrictions and more\nAnd then part of it is the assumption he can do all of that and the other Republicans are still going to vote for him and that is what we saw in two thousand sixteen we see it with the Republicans in Congress and my guess is you'll see it again in the mid\nWhat what's interesting here is that you said\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual Jim this baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first to the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your tickets today at NPR done\nLike opinion polls the president's job approval rating is bouncing in the high thirties low to mid forties nationally but when you look at his approval rating among Republicans it's stratospheric it's\nHigh eighties maybe even not Ninety percent among Republicans so is it that Republicans are coming home or is it that he's doing this to make sure that Republicans go vote because I Would argue they haven't left home\nHere now they they they look what I mean is there some complaints along the way and you have someone like Senator flake warning of a threat to our democracy\nBut in the end it in the polls you're seeing they aren't really going anywhere\nAnd you have to curb the eighty percent because we're talking about him doing things that are really unconventional I still have\nA that that percentage are so part of this is all I mean by coming home is come voting day they're not going to vote for the Democrats and then the rest of it is exactly what you're saying he's just trying to make sure and it turned out battle which is going to happen next week he gets as many people out there as possible\nAnd and we'll see what happens obviously this week changed\nAnd once you do it\nYou know ten Fifteen twenty times and you have been criticized you have to think there's a conscious willingness to go there for whatever reason and so that's when I see what happened the horrendous events that happened I don't think we can white that away\nAnd and real quickly how damaging is all of this to the presidency\nVery damaging the president doesn't respond with sorrow nests and moral authority the presidency is weaker than where it was a year or two ago\nProfessor Julian ... thank you so much for coming on the show being on America on the line

it's not what you're seeing your the problem actually I'm the president is you know the what about isn't as we've talked about Adam ... is an item um but I think it it really does scare some people because we now\nAre seeing that there are a lot of Americans living in a really constant state of fear and what really brought it home not just with an African American communities but talking to a lot of my younger students\nUm and seeing how growing up in a culture of guns and school shootings has really changed your outlook on life\nAnd I think now we're seeing more and more Americans

Brunn must be doing something right or is he\nWell he's a Republican and a Republican state in a which is at this point a pretty easy thing to be um he's he's running as an outsider type candidate he served in the state legislature for a few years and didn't have a huge impact there but um and he served on the local school board but he hasn't really been involved in big time politics before this but says he was inspired to run\nFor the Senate by Donald Trump because he sees them as having similar profiles outsiders not allowed to Simon politics Mike Braun has a very successful auto parts business here he's a pretty wealthy guy who has put a lot of his own money into this race\nSo speaking of outsiders me even though senator Donnelly is ... is a Democrat he's a bit of an outsider when it comes to his party he's pro life he's an anti tax Democrat who's not afraid of running campaign ads to emphasize his conservatism like this one\n\nI flew in my own party [noise]\nJust for funding for for the last\nThe liberal left wants to ... no way\nI'm not into a fair fight some about giving our troops\nVoted to extend the Bush tax\nThe ship jobs to China\nI mean Brandon Trump's border wall defense spending Bush tax cuts and his uh his opponent ships jobs to China\nYeah if you didn't know Joe Donnelly was a Democrat you'd have trouble sometimes knowing the Joe Donnelly the Democrat which is quite frankly which is quite frankly why at a lot of campaign events whether it's Mike Braun or a member of the Republican Party they they call him Democrat Donnelly\nA as if to just constantly remind people hey don't forget he's actually a Democrat and not a Republican despite what he's trying to tell you what Joe Donnelly will tell you is that he doesn't belong really to either party but he stands for Hooters but he's they're hired help that's his line\nSo how was he view\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nFavorably by some certainly I mean the reality is that Indiana is a fairly conservative state so I think a lot of Democrats even if they don't necessarily agree with Joe Donnelly on a lot of these issues\nUnderstand that in order to win a statewide election here you have to side with the other side if you will um from time to time at the same time that the ... Donnelly has ads like that though\nUp to the votes that he's most criticized for by Republicans here are two votes that he proudly stands behind which is against the tax reform bill\nAnd in favor of the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare he he talks about him himself being the last line of defense to save Obamacare in Congress and he's been that way since he served in the house or more than a decade\nAgo now see you didn't mention the one vote he cast that I that I thought you were going to mention that we that giving him in trouble and that is he voted against Jeff now justice Kavanaugh's confirmation\nYes he did and he's quick to tell you but he did vote for\nA President Trump's previous nominee Neil Gorsuch and he uses that to sort of defend why he didn't vote for cabinet which was it wasn't that he had opposition to him sort of on the ideological spectrum he talks about having concerns about his judicial temperament and his impartiality and he points to that\nNow relatively famous hearing of course in the Senate Judiciary committee so he talks about it as listen\nI'm an independent thinker it's not about I'm opposed to President Trump and his nominees because look I voted for Neil Gorsuch I voted for Seventy seven percent of President Trump's judicial nominees I was against Brett Kavanaugh as the person\n[noise] so ... in the CBS battleground tracker poll the libertarian candidate Lucy Brenton she gets three percent is she taking votes from Donnelly or Ron issue even a factor in this race\nYes yes and yes or to all of those questions um I think three percent is low she ran two years ago as well for the U.S Senate against\nHaving by and and now US Senator Todd Young and got five and a half percent of the boat which is usually which is about right for what we libertarians are getting in those sorts of races here in Indiana I Would say if she can only get three percent that's very low\nI Would expect it to be more like five or six or even seven percent and yes in a margin of error race like the one we have here she could absolutely have an impact the problem is\nThat from what little polling we've seen that tells us if she's drawing from either candidate she's actually drawing from both\nUm obviously you think of a libertarian you think of them pulling votes away from Republicans and there's some of that but she has some messages\nI'm On things like medical marijuana or cannabis in general that appeal to a more liberal voters so she's probably drawing from both of them so we'll have an impact probably will be toward one candidate or another harder to say\n\nTo dark reality that I don't know in June in America\nHad been in the kind of all we can hang in there and then something like that would be possible\nVigil are being held across the country for the victims of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh [noise] how much is a national climate of hate and division responsible\nWords matter and rhetoric and kind of climate bigoted rhetoric matters that's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nThe second hour of on point is next\nThis is the any PR news network WINZ am six forty Westfield WINZ FM Ninety One Seventy airfield WFCR eighty eight five eighty three Amherst\nW and then you eighty nine five great Barrington W.

huge turnout for early voting so what do you think that means\nWe want to hear from you or what are you seeing from campaigns and from candidates in your state in in your district in what do you hope for the outcome in these midterm elections were at one eight hundred forty three eight to five five and I'm joined today by Janet Hook\nNational political reporter for the wall Street Journal and they think it's all his editor and publisher of inside elections and Nathan before the break and it was talking about how in Florida that gubernatorial race\nIs garnering a lot of attention and potentially pulling a lot of people to the polls and we heard a caller say exactly that so I was wondering if ... served as an example there are a couple of key states where gubernatorial\nRaces maybe yeah sort of more of the political center of gravity and who might that attracted to the polls\nYeah I think it's a specifically to Florida in specifically with Gillum I mean I think his ability if he can turn out a younger voters and African American voters in the mid term the way the interest in times when Democrats have struggled to turn out those voters in midterm elections I think you could have an impact\nOf further down the ballot you know when we zooming out when were you have multiple house and Senate\nYou know when we have multiple competitive races on the ballot sometimes I'm not sure which which raised was driving what about what I think is interesting about the house in the Senate maps going back to the two Americas is that there's actually not a ton of overlap between the competitive U.S House races\nAnd uh in the Senate map that Florida is Florida is one of the the exceptions to that were there or at least a handful of competitive house races but elsewhere you know the the pockets of the places where Democrats can make big house getting such as\nUm New York and California I mean they have ... but they're not particularly competitive\nI see well let's take a quick call here and Gary is calling from Clarkson Michigan ... you're on the air\nThat you were having me on ... thank you a panel for taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what threat for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well you know one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously the heavy manufacturing state\nThe state that kind of gone through with a lot of it the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so just a progressive guy who was an office there but\nI Want to ask you this question and in terms of you know what does\nPotentially what looks like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in or what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that went over there is a proposal ballot here that will actually\nUm you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very\nPerplexing here which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground\nGarrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty oh for sure\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nIt's probably Michigan if only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which ... ... seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm potential leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was by such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems that question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy and the next two years and how that might that have an impact on uh on on Michigan on on Michigan in Michigan workers\nWell it depends a lot on what happens with the tariffs that he proposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternate between\nA talking about imposing more and more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it I kinda don't know what's next\n... or or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's out working you can just turn to do one eighty and or I were going to we're going to do something else and\nWhen it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty raised in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what is it a contrast between approaches and styles and in their view on the economy as well as\nHow people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that\nFar right you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races are happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race well\nIt's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day okay\nSo this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a roof feuding uh Brian ... statement that he\nHas not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot sheet raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voter suppression feed the narrative because voters oppression and only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in

the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nMagnet thanks for taking my call [noise] um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other big top big issues leading up to this election and it it's just so ridiculous to hear these claims\nDreaming of New England public radio was won't be brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nWomen have said just the opposite I Know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeks leading up to the election [noise]\nBut I mean you have you have to be to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting condition ...\n... thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said\nWell if a NATO was right in talking about how central the health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important and winning issue there is nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue\nUm in past for the past I don't know six election the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there is one issue that has really broad residence for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah the Democrats realized that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between uh the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen\nA asking senator Heller to tell in a vat of family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and to protect their health care and that what you would protect our protections for existing condition\nAnd then you went to Washington\nAnd you broke his promise to cave [noise]\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera\nAnd what they want me to ask him with his best to look in the eyes\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you for all care promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against in Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nYou can say it's time for you to under jobs you consider it a thousand times it's just not true\nI wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican forward I noticed Jeffrey what's remote villages that bill includes pre existing conditions hell's angel identical to send in the eye and tell them to try and it was sort of on\nThe debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Megan ... she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't point radio dot org Megan welcome to the program\nI thanks for having me so how much is health care factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nAs you just heard during that that clip it it's been a huge focal point of the race\nUm you know like like you all are talking about earlier that is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in the ... press conference that happened last summer where\nA Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerns about\nThe first repeal repeal and replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward\nBut then he ended up actually voting in favor of as you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the the repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run numerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nUnless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act stay with it but it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nWrite that this race is still really close and you know if you if you listen to folk talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jackie resin should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was\nConsidered going into this cycle you know the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing reelection on you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the bowls and most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wires I think you know the big question and and we're going to be seeing as how that message resonates with Nevada's nonpartisan are independent voters here um you know whether they do have a significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really is the top issue\nFor voters here and about it now like all\nOf the nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why to Republicans have a chance to gain seats is I'm not convinced for Dean Heller is going to lose so much for much of a cycle I really you know we had it as a toss we I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're we're probably keep it there but in in the back of my my like I said you still going to I think he's going to lose and so that matters to them up but\nIf he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to ... feet in Arizona\nThen you know that increases or ability to actually gain seats but has been interesting in a plug all plugged in Nevada independent from Megan in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone\nWhich which struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two\nCompetitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending ... third district and the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term Nevada enough presidential in mid to Nevada tends to be more Republican maybe\nWhat do you think about that I think that's that's exactly right and that's\nOne of the interesting thing we can sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen and which we saw a complete red weigh ins in Nevada and\nRepublicans swept at you know control all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive house seat I truly was you know a red wave um which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happened in twenty sixteen um but but that point is exactly right you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well\nYou know talking about the United states we have a slightly they run out of time digging David of take a UK tried

your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry Diamond Michael very clearly saying that the problems in Brazil so overwhelming that\nBoth the more just ... distasteful parts and he may not approve of in both narrow fall by the wayside well\nI think it's great to Michael called in because we now have a direct expression of the frustration and anger that produced the victory for this extreme right and I'd say fairly exclusively authoritarian candidate\nAnd the problem is that when you as a voter a turn to or feel that you have little choice but to turn into such a blunt and Savage against them or as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy you're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna or when we look at what's going on in the world now but also the history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office they know failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about his authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is that severe risk right now\nI'm I'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying or Larry Diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo ... their\nUm who was has been very outspoken about his crackdown on drugs and violence there\nOr to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and in twenty sixteen he actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers fitting\nBoss or the millions you know it's the meal\nBut uh [noise] I mean I think\nThat's Philippine president Rodrigo de ... saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to slaughter them uh but Larry Diamond I say we've got some comments coming here from listeners I'm wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the other end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but Sean me getting says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he says I'm outraged that citizens of a foreign country can vote their free will\nAnd someone calling themselves ... ball says is it really a pushback on democracy if the strong man and questioning democratically elected in a legitimate election what do you think what\nI'd say a few things I'm number one uh ... actually has presided over the extrajudicial killing of well over twelve thousand people on the streets with the Philippines\nSo um when autocrats signal their intentions are we we have to take them seriously\nSecondly although there is rising despair\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for

caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action\nTo reform and Clinton's the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change but they are\nBut that doesn't give both sonar license to close down the Congress to close down the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties and I think Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant\nBecause to be great if skateboarding you have to be willing to

me just get some callers in here Alice is calling from Norwalk, Connecticut Alice you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em it's been reported that Steve Bannon was an advisor to both an arrow in his bid for the presidency and as you know he was chief strategist for Donald Trump\nAnd his twenty sixteen presidential election are kind of appalled by uh the fact that Trump utilized him a given the fact that\nBannon is as he says a populist but in my opinion is is actually a white nationalist and I wonder what your guest thought about his influence on in this election um it's disturbing to me that he also supported Marine Le pen um and\n... you know her bid for for a her election in France\nWill look at me just let me let the tissue as a good question let me let our panelists respond thank you for your call oh Laura king of Steve Bannon is uh still working to spread populism throughout the world what influence or role did he have to play if any in Brazil\nWell in terms of Brazil I'm not I'm not I'm not so well versed in that but I Would I Would say that one thing that's been interesting about Mr Bannon is that he's he's encountered some some rejection and some resistance from even some of the European national is with\nWith him he's seeking to make an alliance um some of them are in effect just telling him to to stay out of it and and uh and that does kind of reflect their their sense of of\nOf a ... a homegrown homegrown um tradition but didn't ...\nDidn't they just read though that a ... a Italy's deputy prime minister I'm actually joined a band and his organization called the movement that he founded to spread populous politics in basically undermine the European Union the happened recently right\nI Will miss Japan and I think has has thought actively to to export his what he did for Mr Trump to to Europe and that has that has pretty much been a driving force behind what he's been doing since the since he left the White House I see\nSo let's go to Jill who's calling from St Helena island South Carolina Julie you're on the air\nI make now um I just wanted to say that a strong arm tactics network in the short term\nHowever they are not sustainable over a long time you may get a few quick win but the only way to move forward and not end up and down Nate is to actually up to ... and build relationships with the people you need to work with\nUm the then if you look at it and then you're dealing up process redesign we need to get buy in from all members of the team\nAnd if you don't own any skip that work of relationship building you're always going to have people working on their mind progress even at the progress benefit every one\nMm Jill thank you for your call Larry Diamond um do do people do politicians have the time though to ... to build those those relationships to garner that consensus that Joe was talking about its requisite for a successful democracy\nUm will ... blood to take it back to Brazil or think the question is smoke time boat a structural and some of those particularly if you want to make government work which really important requires making Congress work we have\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools an essay and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pass dot edu\nNoting a fundamental structural impediments\nTo a decent governance in Brazil which is that you've got now Twenty one party's sitting in the Senate thirty parties sitting in the Congress bows records for Brazilian democracy at least in the current era\nAnd because of this extreme system of proportional representation one reason why you had so much corruption\nIn Brazil is the president's need to throw throw around money corrupt lay in order to set a assemble\nCongressional majorities out of this mix and as the former president Fernando Enrique car do so said they've got to fix this system and create a more rational smaller party Congress\n... uh Laura king is to just if I if I can I mean we've been focusing on Brazil up because it's a very rightly points out it's just happened and there's a lot of specific things to talk about\nAh regarding Brazil at the moment but you know should have done this earlier Loren I'm Sorry that I didn't but I Wonder if he could just sort of briefly tell us what countries you would consider um you know part of this\nRise of the strongman trend we should we saying we've talked about the Philippines and talked about Brazil um we you know mentioned the United states even Russia China what else would you would you include in that list\nWell I did have a chance to spend time recently in Poland and Hungary and certainly count them among among this trend and ... I'm Still in touch with some people in Egypt in Turkey from the time that I spent there when I when I Lived in those countries and\nThere's a there's an intensive real alarm in a real sense that things are getting worse and worse\nTo turkey in Egypt as well okay now Larry earlier in the hour mentioned a moody in India to the fall into this category\nOh I think my\nAnd Larry what do you think\nI think a Modi is in no way a as blatant a photo of democracy is ... ... ... you know really believes\nAnd invest in elections a and is never spoken about closing down democracy but he's certainly leaning hard on opposition\nAnd on civil liberties and that's a warning sign to really watch carefully ... well let's go to Tony who's calling from Seattle, Washington county you're on the air\nHigh that I was wondering how much this might be a reaction equivalent thing recently I Know in central and South America it's quite a macho culture I don't know if there's something ... around which I'm\nSure I Know when it's ... and also um which advocates for other civil rights causes\n... threat to the arcade ear authoritarian strongman dictatorships so I didn't have a sociologist there or is he saying anything in this case I'm kind of effect like reaction to that\nLevel a county thanks for your call Larry Diamond what do you think I think that uh our our\nEarlier there was a reference to the a threat from cultural and social change that's driving a lot of the some authoritarian reaction\nAnd it's not only three decades or more of the women's rights movement but gay rights in a in the grand rights and so on\nBut I don't think this can explain the immediate uh six or ... or other right wing alternatives it's very much response as well", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "30"}
