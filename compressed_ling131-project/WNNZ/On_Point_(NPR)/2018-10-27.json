hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nMy guests today are Daniel ... star some men came up the Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack\nBeatty up something in the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah\n[noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm In the president's framing of it as part of a ... as an issue of vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or is there a sense of dissent turning attention mid term elections I think\nThat that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here that this caravan while it is traveling we've kept the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away um you know experts in the region and on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions in their home countries\nAnd trying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these are asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states um I Do want to point out one new development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same national security rationale\nThat they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban and the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that band was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court and one option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border\nYou know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on and addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nGetting a bill or our listeners may or may not know that ... as well as reporting the for the star from Washington or you kind of bird dog the statements from the president from major officials are pretty much in real time in a rather extraordinary way\nI'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered the president's claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in with Central American migrants moving toward the U.S border here's what the vice president had to say\nThe United states of America he intervenes and prevents them terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable\nThat there was not the individuals from the middle east as a part of this growing Kara\nDaniel how accurate as the president and vice presidents from work's been in terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in like a logic class um you know he he was President Pence made a statement that his arguably factual bison based on the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all

from entering the country um had no obvious a connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry shouldn't\nUm has made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this caravan type that had no grounding it ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the ... the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise the number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out he said real power is I don't want to use the word see here\nHe's playing on fear\nA fear of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota there was an interview and the times with a woman in Minnesota who said you know if these people aren't stop their libel to come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabins that that uh people have a summer homes and and staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll be these these these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk the thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this is this is what's here is the magnification of deep seated American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country and you know in violent\n[noise] we've got a call from El Paso Texas said John is calling a John my understands you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew survey thank you for taking my call we we work with a a a little militia down here where mobilized and on the order to make sure that this caravan not make it into our country we're disgusted with what you people in the media have been doing we're sick of your rhetoric against the president\nSo ... you actually to be honest you till they're producers that your your uh uh trying to help [noise] well that's all right\nOh hey there's there there's a line that we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate is it good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air or we are going to return however to one of the comments that are that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star\nA and think about the question she flagged questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he'd been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here's a or just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air uh and she called President Trump his man he advises a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional liar\nDoes he asked the president is speaking mushrooms he asked the president is lying what he's doing it intentionally to incite surfing people which would include left leaning journalist and most of the left leaning politicians and so what ends up happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they say oh wow the president's lying\nAnd his face is basically laughing at 'em okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria if you call the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your peer group\nSo Daniel Dale ... compares a sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the

assisted treatment abstinence only in twelve step programs where white hundred for two three eight to five five that's when a hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose a chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to oppose it you've called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right we're either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death and our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges in human body for heroin and fentanyl are that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said even orphan methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower mortality rate we could take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nAh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at our needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication\nOr you'll get a prescription for it and I prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for buprenorphine\nAnd Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Mara Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place that mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner a and our prison system who needs it\nAnd I'll say briefly that if you look at that model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post in car sort of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the twelve percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where\nWe're trying all these things ah and hopefully they'll turn the tide um kitten O'Neill with\nWe have so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north up and get your blood red zone or get your tickets today at NPR does\nIncarcerated multiple times never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being treat you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight they often abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absence base which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know\nI'm Brandon just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when he was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking methadone or if you're taking the pornography and while you're not really clean clean you're not silver right\nAnd we just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and so denying people access or making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say people you know like you can't have this drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\nGet it was like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what could a saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we're headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically and if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduced uh the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict\nI used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on ... been working for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality is a losing\nProposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking a medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nKnow we've been getting fascinating and strong response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not choose to have either he post on our

South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call uh-huh I wanted to hear a little bit because I I'm Sorry I just want to hear you what your thoughts were about all this\nWell I'm I'm a recovering addict and I think an addict ever is here because I think for men were hard wired differently than normal people you know our one Tylenol and they'd be good for somebody ... five would be great for me um I went from\nI hated pain medicine until I had um oral surgery and they gave me opiates and all of a sudden I was in love I thought this what's happened I kidney span then they gave me I think drugs um and and that was even better I was like God heaven and are\nYou know and then they and they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're out there on your own with your body meaning for more of what you can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what need\nMhm thank you for that jaded we've also call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nBarry how you're doing okay I think the police chief from\nVermont is right on but I I I got to tell you if the drug companies that were providing the medicated assisted medication or pushing that drug as hot as\nPer do chemicals push the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because of medication as a fact of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like would have seen over the last ten years\nYou know the the uh pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back on the pharmaceuticals the front and all is being a flooded throughout the addiction a heroin belt in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people\nThat are stabilized on a on the medication and then what happens is that there are off and then they relapse died because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot up front and all of the they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a ... you know and they got a couple of them and they die now my history I was incarcerated because of my opiate a ...\nAnd uh I relapsed that day I got out had been read today I'd be dead because to twenty percent of the population that Iraqis living proven that have a addictive um a heroin histories die within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nLet me let me what the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this but didn't want to let you weigh in on a couple of things first you've heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a\nAn active part of the solution constructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not currently part of the problems or how does that a seat in with your reporting on this\n[noise] well um\nIt sits in in that um you know they just um that have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others in some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a ... a little bit and make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the cheap and what's happening in Vermont\nIs that's really unusual I mean my ... is just off to him\nBut in a state where uh we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently I mean we have we have a\nTalking forgive me you're talking about Medicaid expansion\nRight yeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nProgram we have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs I'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against a ranch exchange so\nWhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails and um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live or whether you get this lifesaving treatment or not\nBut we we have a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis is a reflection of American culture to disease of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstriction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia\nA you know stretching from the you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they could rely on steady jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a vet titled sign was being pushed ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are\nMental health issues and so ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book cause interviewed a or one of his teachers asked him in middle school when you want to be when you grow with when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you wouldn't be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... opioids were prescribed three hundred six hundred percent that the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nAnd recently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex aides are said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or he cited figure showing at two point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty Seventeen to march twenty Eighteen according\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose death seems to finally be benefiting\nIn the right direction plus telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nBritain don't pose a you know the number of Americans dying from opioids are related deaths appears to be a ... the number of Americans in total who died in the Vietnam War but it's the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this\nWell first of all there that's every year right so the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so\nI think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for America to fix it spiritual Malaysia's before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we're being derelict in our duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders they wanted to wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like mayor Weinberger here in Burlington or a a chief of police um you know we get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield",
