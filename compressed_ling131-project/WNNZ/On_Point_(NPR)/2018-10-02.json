P. R. you could win two great the ticket Boston opera house and then you have to worry that eastern standard\nAnswer now in any T. R. dot and not\nFight [noise] well you\nKnow they ah they take I think all of them take very seriously with a view of the the institutional credibility of the court it's it's well taught strong law schools they all know him very well that the\nCourts and the courts in general don't have an army at their disposal they they they simply a exert power through the credibility of their decisions uh and so the institutional legitimacy of the court is something that they all we'll talk about now what might\nThreaten it uh maybe different two different justices but I don't think any of them like the idea of a a a a very political and personal a fight over a appointing a an injustice I I Can't think that any of them\nUh feel this is good for the reputation of the Supreme Court which really does seek to say that what it does is different\nFrom what the other two branches of government do\nI'm Glad you brought that up we're going to be talking about this with the panel later on in the show but this\nThe the notion of the institutional credibility of the court and I keep thinking back to what um judge Kavanaugh said last Thursday where he railed against Democrats on the panel on the Senate Judiciary committee panel\nWhere he talked about a conspiracy of uh people trying to exact revenge on him um through the Clintons\nHow does talk like that from as Supreme Court nominee\nHow does that have an impact on the institutional credibility of the court I Can't imagine that the sitting justices liked hearing that [noise] well\nI you know I don't know what they were like I don't know whether they even watched it a\nMean judge Kavanaugh certainly came to the bench in the DC circuit where he currently sets with a very strong partisan pedigree but once on the DC circuit\nHe certainly took steps to distance himself from that passed I mean he he ceased to registering as a Republican you know ... he's an became an independent or decline to state\nOr he certainly no longer you know would have a you know contributed a political campaigns are done anything directly involved in in in partisan politics\nAnd he worked a it seemed very hard for a dozen years to develop a different reputation and that was reflected in his a very high rating by the American bar association and buy things that you know I and other reporters heard about\nHis his performance on the circuit court and the views of his colleagues even those with you know different uh ideological persuasion Z\nA his you know his work a teaching is higher you know we're grades from from students who he taught at a law schools\nAre so he certainly like many judges has a political background many of the judges on the court Supreme Court now at a political background I mean you know you gotta know somebody to get appointed by the president and that often as through politics\nOr budge recently certainly in the face of of these allegations are by by by Dr Christine Blasey Ford and and and the other ones that are very um\n[noise] uh I guess a sort of judicial a persona that he had cultivated fell away to a degree and uh you know whether the other justices think that was a reasonable or not and the circumstances I I Can't say but it's certainly will be in the mind of litigants who come to the court and are looking to\nCount the five that's the majority they need to win the case they're going to be thinking about what you know pushes each justices buttons and uh they got a you know perhaps more insight into what what makes a Brett Kavanaugh tick\nWell right now there are only eight justices on the Supreme Court so how is the absence of a ninth justice influencing the docket this term [noise] well\nJust eight justices it's eight justices who are divided evenly ah by general philosophy or judicial ah ideology doesn't mean that you will always have four liberals against for conservatives but in\nMany of the more a significant kind of hot button cases that is what the line up will be and so if they want to get to a majority there has to be some level of of consensus were ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co-op offering

what that looks like from the time that a Justice Scalia died and uh the vacancy persisted in Institute twenty Seventeen and the court took more\nModest steps that did last uh because uh you needed to uh to find a way that you could have people have very different views agree so if the court persist set an eighth justice a number for a longer period you know it it probably will look like that or if However I'm a\nYou know judge Kavanaugh or one of of similar philosophy is is confirmed than I think will the terminal look more like like last term which is very conservative\nAnd it's and most of its outcomes [noise] in the interim while you have eight justices what happens if they can't agree or at all or if they divide for for a than the lower court ruling stands as he is but it doesn't not or create a national precedent\nOf the court could also order ... argument after it gets a another justice that has happened from time to time historically and Nineteen I'm fifty three chief justice Vincent died\nEarl Warren was appointed as the new chief justice and he re heard they the court we heard brown versus board of education and chief justice Warren than than ... next term wrote the a

hearing and which Dr Christine Blasey Ford and judge Brett Kavanaugh testified wasn't emotional deeply disturbing display and judge Kavanaugh's tone was a far cry from his last appearance before the committee this statement in particular gave many people pause\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political fuels with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record rip van on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition\nGroups compare that to how judge Kavanaugh described the correct judicial temperament in twenty Fifteen at Catholic university\nTo be a good judge in a good umpire it's important to have the proper demeanor\nReally important I think to walk and the other issues whether it be the other litigants five voted against in the case the other judges to understand them to keep our emotions in check\nTo be calm admits the storm on the bench to to put it into the vernacular don't be a jerk I think that's important\n[noise] so I wanted to play those two clips because I just want to know if if\nIf this is a new normal for the for the Supreme Court and\nHave we ever seen the Supreme Court so politicized before and I'm going to bring in a in a presidential historian of Supreme Court historian a little bit later in this segment but I Want to bring in my panel now to talk this through and joining me in the studio is WNYC is Brian Lehrer host of the Brian Lehrer show\nIn Los Angeles Rolling Stone senior writer Tamil Smith\nAnd from Washington syndicated columnist Mona ... welcome all Bryan since you were here in the studio with me those two clips I'm back to back are rather stark\nCompared to like what we saw last week and I I'm just wondering how is it possible that one person can showed diametrically opposed temperaments\n[noise] I guess the question is which is the real Brett Kavanaugh and which is an act\nYou know there was a lot of reporting in the last week that President Trump in particular deciding whether to stick with Brett Kavanaugh or bail on him did not like how passively came across on Fox News interview we could go\nAnd tell them you better dial it up when he gets to that hearing or somehow got word to him to that effect\nI'm and show we saw a Brett Kavanaugh who really does have the judicial temperament that he's displayed in his years on the bench and in that second clip dialing it up\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western

partisan warrior 'em and Damascus come off and now he can't be trusted fund the Supreme Court ah to be you know even handed when things have partisan overtones and I don't know the answer which is which\nAre monitoring the same question to you [noise] [noise]\nWell you have to bear in mind that a\nWhile I was not crazy about the uh the invocation at the Clintons and the suggestion that this is a partisan witch hunt and so forth that the\nThat Kavanaugh engaged in here was a man who had been accused of the most gruesome crimes\nUm whose entire reputation which two weeks ago was sterling and the ... in their highest possible rating and people of all backgrounds um who have known him and argued cases before him on the DC circuit court that he served on honorably for twelve years [noise]\nYou know saying his praises and and reiterated that yes he had the judicial temperament and yes he was fair minded and and a civil and wonderful to everybody whoever appeared before him and on and on\nAnd suddenly all of that is completely trashed tea is being accused of these gruesome\nCrimes and um so yeah he was he was deeply emotional he was defending his reputation and as I say he probably dial up a T to use the phrase that was just you know he probably dial that up to high end down and it was it was inappropriate but\nTotally understandable when his entire life and reputation has been called into question\nYou know I Know you and I probably want to jump in and jumping on this day we learned today that the FBI investigation into the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nHad been somewhat expanded and the fate of his nomination may all come down to not whether he drank a lot as a high school and college student but whether he lied to Congress about it\nWhich President Trump didn't seem to get when he was talking to reporters at the White House today take a listen to this\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man [noise] with strength the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years because nobody said anything bad about him in many many years they go back to high school\n... this is what this is one of those situations where you know if you look on Twitter and social media and there are people who are pointing out the various areas where judge Kavanaugh his statements and\nHad been seemed to have been found to be a bit contradictory shall we say [laughter]\nUm [laughter] uh ... ... ... with\nThe president doing this to cow the cabin on the way he did it does the president help or hurt judge Kavanaugh on this\nI think the president is trying to redefine the terms of the ... and I think that he certainly I'm sure accomplishing that with a certain segment of Americans populist\nBut at the law in the long run it's not necessarily about the allegations themselves and whether or not they can be proven by the FBI investigation or send it to this year investigation and whatnot\nBut it is about how judge Kavanaugh reacted to those allegations how do you show your temperament how do you show your ability to not only remain composed but also to make sure that huge judicial a judgment not to you know double up on those words and\nYou can be trusted and frankly I think you know he's shown unequivocally that he cannot be trusted to\nYou know your case fairly high Trumbull to think what would happen should have Planned Parenthood ordinary role or what have you uh be involved in a suit before the Supreme Court

truth\nWould emerge and to that point there may be an incredible historic historical on any\nShaping up here with Kevin on having worked on the Clinton investigation in the nineties and having said that thing last week about revenge on behalf of the Clintons the focus may wind up shifting increasingly from what actually happened at the party that Dr Ford remembers\nTo whether Kavanaugh is being truthful\nAnd Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about sex under oath\nOne of the things the FBI is possibly investigating like now is whether Brett Kavanaugh lied about sex under oath set that contentious hearing last week there was a phrase in his year book were not an alumnae\nWhich he said was not a reference to a girl who some guys allegedly had sex with and they turned out that it was and the other lies\nRelated to sex that even if it turns out there's no evidence demonstrating sexual assault that they may be checking in if any of that turns out to be a demonstrable why real lie

I got to just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say it again this is the meeting a Monday October thirteenth he doesn't eat you say nine men stood milling around in the room men I should note right nine men\nFor and I really and truly some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you write I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it that uh you\nKnow who works for he does it if it ever worked for the banks are you know or or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net that get FDR said about insurance and fed access and all of that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government supports like Deposit Insurance can can offended by a risk taking and too big to fail\nDish really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's

joke [laughter] I Can't I Can't be little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I Do think\nThat it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just\nI I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at the ... the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and whether we fix said I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements and and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and\nSo we need more better tools and I think that's absolutely the wrong system that's the system we still have that we don't want to say that system that you would let things go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put back into a resolution process to break it up you know keep its bad assets\nOut impose the losses on the shareholders in the end secured creditors which is where the law so should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy to fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors are new management\nTo an end in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process or ... unique things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a\nDifficult to you yeah that's a tool we didn't have been to them we have now been hit regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this is the new process not bailouts but accountability\nFor going to ask you can you know of course many questions you live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis I mean as long as the banks are too big already won a\nBoy you know well up there are people\nWho have that view and I can understand that view and ah yeah I I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan and unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now that would reduce or three of the largest banks we have a reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed and in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress stretching\nRequirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought you know Republicans are market oriented\nButter Republicans trying to pressure the fed to reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter] that's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think today then again she loves her\nI said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just it can't\nLook look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two thousand eight crisis and and even you know the eight million a homeless lost nine million jobs lost you know the the terrible hit to the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ...\nDreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and

leave Syria quote\nAs long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and

you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is Kyle rent for he's a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by that we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the prior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary\nOf defense Mattis that us troops are only fighting ISIS\nHowever they do point secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country a\nBowl and kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdrawal is uh the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding\nOf like the mission parameters that waste\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John Bolton comment said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission\nAgain until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces command and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA bus but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and on its\nAffiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that the way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to cook it by saying\nThat us troops or a conductor and counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is this new language or or I may be to use ... raise cows description of it more over language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n\n[noise] well\nI think people in the Phoenix Prize Fight that suddenly coming out you can't survive on that we've seen that yet because as you and then a few months ago um ... check the chips were going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be ... owned by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate all involved in Syria that she's Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood has been expecting he likes to go and they think predicate Jeanette policy on us troops going the idea that that actually going to be staying ... definitely puts them back like\nIn ... when it comes to negotiate cheating and then to the mall and I think it should be on our Web that she'll go lead at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric on ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nYou cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceived\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nMeat week some lawmakers did question or the U.S military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and here you're going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton\nPressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission of fighting ISIS\nThe problem is that national security adviser John Bolton state of the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran\nEspecially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of a wrong not actions of ISIS or the defeat of ISIS\n... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what Congress and molten is saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're\nIn the region with the mission to balance against U.S forces or restrict those forces for him to maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has a show and a willingness to get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's the question of the Aspen brought up\nAh during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from too doesn't want it to happen to\nKnow Liz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to submit to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like can you tell us a little bit more about that\n[noise] well yeah I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a

or body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity and the public trust\nIn the United States Supreme court and whether or not the court itself is becoming more politicized overtime I'm joined today by Stuart Taylor he's author and contributing editor for the national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us She's court and law courts in reporter for slate and host of the economic as podcast as well\nAnd I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where politics definitely came into play a\nFirst of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October two days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a rubber book ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of the politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and ... and all of this is not to me nor is it to all of those who have stood vastly supported by nomination Andrew Moore I'm deeply grateful\nRather the damage to the ... the integrity of law and a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nCircles for national disgrace [noise]\nAnd from my standpoint [noise] as a black American as far as I'm concerned it as a high tech lynching for ... for\nAn anyway Danes to think for themselves [noise] to do for themselves to have different ideas that it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland a who President Obama nominated and um we can't play any tape there because he never even got a hearing\nSo that takes us then to where we are now in two thousand Eighteen and just last week present a Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort as very calculated and orchestrated political fueled the parents are about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about judicial record were friends for the Clintons\nMillions of dollars in money from outside\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries ... farms down small ones farm dot com\nYeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\n[noise] I I you know I think it it was a I think that it it's a funny it's perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake when he talked to really\nIn Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral I'm tired so in a sense what Robert Bork with being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost a mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual doubt China is standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot I have no ... balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork with the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is that funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very cold here very coherent that channel record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that but I think at least Bork\nWas honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advice and consent it did so knowing yeah that's gone\nWe'll Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that that naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight to zero I think maybe it was Ninety eight to to\nUh I think it was hero a Bork I understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible not to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nBut where the Democrats did was Bork and and what may ...\nWas the smeared him\nIn every conceivable way except a sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display\nYou know that this was how they thought they could win now which Thomas was more complicated with a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his a performance in front of the committee\nA he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges or or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a then mired him in terms of judicial temperament\nDreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar hoping homes businesses firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy

other day which totally out of character for Kavanaugh in this process I think drove them after\nA while and and and a done deal this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or ... the nuclear option button into them Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees and to thousands Seventeen that removed you know what was the most effective\nBreak in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this

Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is from last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and disrupt\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old is uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends this is the new norm\nYou better watch out for your nominee\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American lifestyle\nAre political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues introduced legislation that ends lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break ahead to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court and doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate\nTurning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them um and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justices but I think it's probably worth just treading into the conversation that justice is view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas\nNever fully recovered from what he thinks we're done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that\nIf Brett Kavanaugh was elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so\nThey are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is a perception that the public and that's something that I think we really do have to factor\nIn conversation I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there some evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justice his own voting or just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps uh I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we have justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be the perceived\nA preferred vote of the president that in the nominating them and put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nOf nominees to the Supreme Court the politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense but also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics politics in places are ruling the court\nAnd people often times do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the ideal\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and the firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nIs legitimacy is loss and no longer people are going to follow his dictates well\nLet's go to college here finally and thank you for ... for waiting patiently on the line was go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to see it so I'm almost be through it [noise] first of all I'm to the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public trust been lost\nTo perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repent replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public side now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a popular show in modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a\nGiven a perception of what is and what is not but [noise] to the last several months from Donald Trump in his a blatant disregard for for for the\nConstitution and Republicans with this film down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats in law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the court is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limited on terms now because this is simply a political position\nWell Erin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one side they're about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with\nJustice is well I think term limits as a wonderful idea I thought that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nA because it would require this may be a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be heard who's gonna who's people or older [laughter]\nYou know who's terms or later is it going to help the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going on I think that's what we're going to be seen from for a long time\nWell let's go to truly who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the truly\nI thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken for Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the Joe\nI I'm I guess what I figured that I called the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the question was going up work about how when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justice is whether or not I got the right to marry my dad\nAnd now I'm kind of seeing that play out of gang where there's a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more of the plane down to\nUm the ... the right it's actually just a code word for religious so it's a bunch of religious people on the right who want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some
