Democrats dangerous which is sort of an interesting in version of twenty sixteen rhetoric and obviously as a pretty full schedule out there right now\nI'm the one thing that we're we haven't been talking about and in any of the world this would be major news that was the un report that came out yesterday warning that climate change is happening more rapidly and with more serious consequences than anyone had thought\nI'm the president said he wants to look at and this is what he said who drew it\nThat's what he said in his in his words is this un report do you think something that um the Trump White house and the president in particular will take seriously\n\nYeah it's sort of an amazing combat and it's sort of amazing how much a story like that it's just not making traction over the un over\nUm Nikki Haley over the election um you know climate change is one of the issues that scene\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nToday and it hasn't really bad and maybe the Paris accord so you know it's hard to it's going to change\nA and one more a sin to leading issue to talk about speaking of the election going back to the election Taylor Swift\nAnd her announcement on on Sunday when she announced through Instagram that she was going to food to support the Democrat running for Senate Senator in Tennessee the former governor former governor rather than\nUm she encouraged her one hundred twelve million followers to register to vote and vote dot org experience and unprecedented flood of new registrations nationwide\nUm they're quoted as saying up to sixty five thousand registrations in a single twenty four hour period since Taylor Swift post now we talk a lot about the impact of celebrity endorsements but there's no denying that Taylor Swift had an impact here\nYeah I mean sending stand I Do think it might be a little bit of a taste of what I Would call\nPost ... ... ... in that day also happened to me you know the voter registration deadline in a whole lot of state which I Would think might also have a little bit to do at that age so certainly you know when somebody said that like kind of had an impact it a little hard angle that\nFrom jazz you know an election suddenly living and a lot of people encouraging everyone to get out there and\nOur Ryan REO Edwards levy thank you very much for being on America on the line and get so much for having me\nNow with the mid term elections now exactly one month from today we're starting to see more campaign ads and it seems like a good time to check in on the messaging and let's start with the Republican themes that are bubbling up themes like\nMy opponent is a socialist or the Democrats are going to impeach Brett Kavanaugh or the Democrats are going to teach President Trump or both\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell today thank the Capitol police for keeping senator safe from what he called mob tactics used by the far left\nLet's dive in to all of this with longtime conservative a commentator and writer Charlie Sykes he is in Milwaukee resident and he's also the author of how to write lost its mind a Charlie thank you very much for being on America on the line as usual here\nSo right now the president is in Iowa he at another campaign rally he is hammering away at at\nThe Democrats the Democratic party Democrats by name I'm Elizabeth Edwards\nA Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi you name it he's attacking them why is the president going after Democrats and also advancing this notion that you know the the Democrat is this law lifts mom when there are other things he could be talking about such as\nThe great economy why isn't he doing that\nThat's an extraordinarily interesting question and and and I think it reflects the the the nature of our politics which is dominated by negative partisanship look Donald Trump understand\nI think we all believe that that in order to get the conservative base riled up he needs a foil he needs to have an other an enemy\nSo the Democrats are not just wrong on the issues there for open borders they're going to let the MS Thirteen into your community or they're going to bankrupt the country they are socialists or they are joining up these mobs\nAnd you you can tell that that that does this has been a consistent theme for Donald Trump that Donald Trump um and and the Republicans have a lot more energy when it comes to describe what they're against what they are outraged about and what they want voters to be afraid of as opposed to what they're actually four and\n... will will disappear tactics work I mean you could argue that\nThey worked in twenty sixteen are they going to work in twenty eight teams\nWill fertile that's a key point that they did work in twenty sixteen by Mickey into a binary choice and the binary choice is basically you don't have to like Donald Trump you don't have to believe in Donald Trump but no matter how awful he is the other side is always worse and it's always scary\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nI think the Republicans are you know going to at least to the Trump divide\nRepublicans up it's who knows whether it's going to work or not um we may be heading into an election where we have a you know diverge results were it will work in Senate elections in red states but failed miserably in house seats where you have a lot of college educated voters ... college educated women\nNow usually in a midterm election um everyone looks at this as a referendum on the president and with this particular president ... is that is that the case or time's up ... and is this a referendum on Trump and and if so who wins if that's the case\nWell it is a referendum on Donald Trump or ... as you were describing a little bit or you know earlier\nThere's almost no other story that can get traction were not able to talk about you know massive stories that have\nHuge consequences will not debating the future of the national deficit we're not talking about national security when it came about global climate change we're not even talking about what happened to those children who were separated at the border right everything is about Donald Trump and so this election is very much a referendum on Donald Trump and then once again\nWho has a fantastic boyfriend I have nephews I'm not worried about them\nThey're they respect women I mean this idea that your boys are at risk\nIs ridiculous and I also want to join into what Claire was saying about the use of the term mob about women who were indeed emotional many of them sexual assault survivors I saw a mob in Charlottesville I saw mobs\nIn the Tea Party I didn't see any mobs in the Senate those men were not afraid of their physical safety unless they're tiny little man baby cowards [laughter]\nWound Joan ... we're we're going to take a

thirteenth tickets are on sale now at any P. R. dot net\n[noise] this is NPR News network some public radio [noise]\n\n[noise] I started in K party and you're listening to America on the line we're back with Joan Walsh of the nation and bug feeds Ben Smith so for all the talk of a blue wave but takeover of the house and maybe even the Senate there are complaints that the Democrats don't have a unified message\nAnd so my message to both or do they need one band\nBasically not I mean midterm midterm elections are typically to somebody you know they're driven by dislike of of the of the ruling party this case you know Donald Trump the house the Senate and that gives Democrats room to run very different campaigns in different places\nAnd so you see a Democrat in West Virginia run a campaign in which he supported Brett Kavanaugh for instance and Democrats in Florida and Georgia running kind of a much more progressive campaign you've ever seen in there and I think you know you you're going to see a very very wide range and\nAn end who wins and who loses in there we'll we'll we'll say it will shape the party going forward\nJoan I mean do do are are Democrats running national races or or to pick up on Ben Ben with her or highly localized races or a combination of the two\nI think they're mostly localized I I just spent two weekends with Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA you know watching her talk about Medicaid expansion which is actually popular among sixty percent\nOf Republicans are watching her barely mentioned even her opponent Brian Kemp and not mentioned I don't think I should be careful I don't remember her mentioning Donald Trump even once seriously\nShe talks about the cradle to career education she talks about losing eight million dollars a day because the state did not take federal money to expand Medicaid or it it's it's a national race there's a lot of national attention there's national money on both sides\nBut as she goes from you know appearance to appear and she's talking about why Valdosta doesn't get the same tax benefits or flexibility\nThat Atlanta does a and you know from what I see of Andrew Gillum he's doing the same so we you know here in the metropolitan elite a national reporters are obviously focusing on national trends and national meaning\nBut when you get down into the you know the but the state level and even more so in state legislative races you're seeing a very local message\n... speaking of your media elites and and our focus on non local issues one big issue is impeachment whether it's impeachment of judge justice cabinet or impeachment of President Trump's national reporters keep asking democratic candidates right leaders what they think of the issue here\nIs um house minority leader Nancy Pelosi speaking with Dana Bash of CNN a week ago at the Atlantic women of Washington series so\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nGeorgia may not have enough to go on my back to impeach the president and that was [noise] you know that's fine\nAgain with the information that comes forward and\nTemperament that is not judicial\nAnd I think it's easy for we we metropolitan elites actually maybe it's more than just people who live on Twitter you can sort of see these incredibly divisive national issues the central I think if you are running house races if you're in the house leadership\nIf if if you were ... if if you're thinking about a voter who is burning to pitch Donald Trump they're going to show up and vote for the Democrats and the voter that you are trying to get out as somebody who\nCares much more about a local issue cares about you know they're you know I think it's it's easy to forget that their independence of their swing voters that there are people who are less polarized and that's what Democrats are trying to pull their way and I think they know but I think none of them the impeachment as as as helpful in that meanwhile does get Republicans have said right\nAnd what about the conversation about about civility about um civility whether you know the loss of it or\nFighting because the other party isn't isn't being civil and and I am saying that because I'm a former Democratic presidential a nominee Hillary Clinton former secretary of state had something to say about that just this week just the other day here's what she said\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that twin civility can start again\nSo to me what I Love about that quote is that it is it's basically telling people when you feel that your your country and everything that you you believe in and stand for is at stake that all this talk about civility is out the window until you get to a point where you can restore it no\nI mean I agree and I think that all the talk about civility is another example of the mainstream media and a ban might have my back on this or might not\nYou know it just wanting to do a two sides kind of ... equivalents and we are in a situation where we do have children and babies in jail we had children being taken away there we have an amazing AP story today\nAbout children who will never be returned to their parents are going to put the put up for adoption\nWe know about the climate change ah information we got this week\nWe had a party that is so beyond being civil a that is so slowly into power were told that when we yell about\nUh the charges against Brett Kavanaugh that we were not allowed to ever talk about Merrick Garland if you ever if you're ever on cable TV or you know in a debate and you mentioned Merrick Garland it's like oh well all you want is revenge for Merrick Garland I don't want revenge and I just want it on the ... record\nSo there's no civility because of the Republicans\nI Want to go to John ... who is calling in from Raleigh North Carolina John thank you for calling into America on the line\nFight so you're you're a democratic precinct chair\nI Am so I made a low level Democratic Party official here in North Carolina um and yeah it's a little I'm loving this conversation that you all are having I'm On the radio and I just wanted to add a couple of viewpoints struck me here in the south the how quickly\nI'm ... yeah the the um\nWhat happened with sweat Kavanaugh and the way he presented himself in the confirmation hearing with outrageous um he did after getting um shop truthfully he\nUm and Republican senators did not represent 'em ... before getting it simply a women's issue and that's not

is in the reelection race of his career and joining me to talk about this bellwether state our our regular contributor\nMilwaukee resident Charlie Sykes author of how to write lost its mind and Craig Gilbert political reporter and Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel and Wisconsin listeners we want to hear from you call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five to tell us\nWho you're voting for and the issues that matter in Wisconsin that's eight four four seven four or five talk\nGet Craig and Charlie welcome to America on the line Charlie welcome back thank\nCraig let me start with you I'm clearly Governor Walker's reelection races that the high high profile race in this state and your latest article you report that while Walker has strong support from the conservative base he's struggling\nTo reach voters in the middle why do you think that is and why are swing voters so important in this race\n... important because Wisconsin's are really evenly divided state [noise] they swing by definition Scott Walker is always one independent voters in his victorious campaigns but he's losing them right now so his problems really go to sort of\nWhat we call it sort of true independents people that really don't lean toward either party but he also has a problem with with kind of soft Republicans independent leaning moderate Republicans a lot of these people\nBelong to that minority within the party that have major qualms about Donald Trump and the polling shows that they're supporting Scott Walker but by much smaller margins than the party base and they're also\nYou know not very mobilize there are a lot less enthusiastic about voting so\nHe's got a problem with soft Republicans and he's got a problem with independence is partly has to do with Trump partly also has to do is you know running for a third term being around for eight years having run for president right after winning his second term um he's got a lot going on there well\nEntirely that gets to the question I was going to ask you whether you thought a Walker's presidential bed or his current support of President Trump is affecting his chances in his current reelection bid for governor\n... ... crackers right in his analysis that there there's a couple of things I've been going on with us Scott Walker number one is\n... remember he's been around for eight years and he's been already been through three elections so there's a certain degree of Walker fatigue um and then of course you have the Trump hangover the wouldn't interesting thing about Scott Walker here in Wisconsin I Know Craig has written about this extensively is\nThey're remarkably few swing voters when it comes to a Scott Walker we we we are eight and evenly divided state but at the poll numbers for Walker generally don't move that much because people are so locked in place because the the political polarization after ... was so intense\nSo to a certain extent with the exception of the Trump factor\nThis election does feel like almost all of his other elections I mean almost in every one of those\nElections it looks like it's close it's tough and and then and then he they they basically grind it out and get it out based on turn out so you know what what Craig says about the turnout is absolutely crucial if Democrats turnout in numbers be above and beyond what they normally turnout Scott Walker's in in trouble if he can if he does not\nUm turnout his hardcore crawl through you know fire you know over glass a Republican base turnout than he's also in trouble as well because he always wins relatively narrowly and there's not a lot of swing voters and play\nI'm going to ask you another question before I go to callers I didn't mention that his Democratic opponent is Tony ... and his campaign's been attacking a Scott Walker for cuts the main to to education funding but Walker himself has declared that he is the quote education governor how's this issue playing out in the race\nWell it's a it's a huge issue I mean it's the one issue in the governor's race that both sides are talking about in their TV ads which makes it which is really interesting 'cause if you think of education is an issue that Democrats spend more time talking about but I think Scott Walker sense it was a vulnerability because\nScreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from a certified naturally ruined fruit from in Amherst with a farm standards for sixteen bay road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nIs education spending over tax cuts in Wisconsin so he tried to address that and of course he's running against the state school superintendent so it's a big central issue and and it you know it's going to have an impact on this race in the end\nI'm going to go to um I asked people from Wisconsin to Colin Colin to eat for for seven four or five eight to five five and ... from Madison, Wisconsin is calling in thank you for calling into America on the line\nYeah thanks thanks for having me you know just to expand on education there I walked over the last year by eight years is cutting millions of dollars and community schools and\nTwo hundred and fifty million dollars from the University of Wisconsin and they think about schools really anchor all these communities across Wisconsin and across Wisconsin but when the schools closed the communities really suffer\nAnd a lot of the families they move from those communities and an interesting dynamic here we've had dozens of referendum across the state where communities repeatedly had voted to increase their taxes to support their school so when they see their education\nYou know at their community school being cut and they have to go vote\nThemselves to raise their own property taxes just to keep their schools open it shows you a real dichotomy there and you know and you compare that against a Tony Evers who's a superintendent of schools and she's been talking about investing billions in schools and particularly in special education and it gives you a real contrast between the candidates\nAnd um you know this has also been playing out when you talk about infrastructure as well I mean our roads\nHave been rated the lowest here for years and you know for the last eight years he had one party rule in ... they haven't been able to figure out a mechanism to actually find our infrastructure and our roads are short of raising fees on electric vehicles\nAnd hide and go you just let me ask you a question because I've been able to point out that you are running for Dane County board district number six why are you running for office\nYeah so actually I I Am that Dan county board a district six a supervisor and I you know one of the one of the reasons I was just recently\nElected in April and one of the reasons I was really looking to run it because I think all politics is local and the more we can focus on local issues and we have to her real important distinction in these midterms\nIt's kind of boils down to a lot of the issues that matter here in our communities like for example and our attorney general's race or our attorney general has not test\nShe took years to test rape kits and if we think about what just played out with Dr Kavanaugh already and with Dr Ford and a judge Kavanaugh\nYou know after

all the moves he would make in order to conquer the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes\nThat effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth chai far Sally and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climb do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single movie\nUm I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know from my new for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the pitch I could just count on myself to to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole the whole face so many times that that are kind of just remembered most of it\nUm you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay [laughter] but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense of ... when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental armor ... what is\nThat I I actually um I actually don't call them in ... in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut I'm actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think it's I feel like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like ... if something has to scare you sort of get psyched up and like\nShields your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a sustainable way to climb all kept like there's just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall to wall and I am and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up for anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus and work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film and a half two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to show comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about it and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free soul is many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report discs\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm

have this mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nTown they're from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing ropes that has really that really drew you in [noise]\nAh yeah well good good question um I mean basically you know I mean to not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes free soul and can mean scrambling a beautiful ridge in the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for real plus climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an anti social youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the feeling of freedom the speed or the efficiency I mean there's certain joy in bin climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing and stole a small fraction of of my normal climbing yeah you know I'd I'd I climb all styles all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing in and free zone is always sort of represented this\nThis extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean yeah\nYou don't know I yeah I I totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climbing to me as well even though it's only a small part of what I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant in a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads and I mean is it is it is shown that you just cannot enter or experiencing any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a a a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know and on and in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about\nYou know every time that I did that I got a little better at and it's just like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my likes low level climbing\nEvery every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering minded ... feeling of\nConstant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone is seeking a slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly hurting than what you've done before so you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do\nBut of course which we only know the cost of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but never to blend\nWell I mean we were all facing in every way and I mean we're all going to die I'm I'm trying my best not to die climbing I very much want to move to old age and have a

Chivers Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor dangerous if they're who did that an MRI skin of your brain sort of talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about um you know that\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nUh you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nI mean not particularly um yeah I mean in in general I I have a strong sense of I mean I Am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first at the scan yeah and um and the take away to me was basically just that you know practice the that over time you can desensitized to things and that's that's pretty much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time it was nice to hear from I heard that she was at a one of the pioneers for for free so over that didn't get to see her rather than the other one in ... out with her more actually but\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you guys back in touch you know I I was really excited to have our too because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this are you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh and they just you just like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it\nOr I mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know and so I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call or who wants to a colleague who wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to get his calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nAttacks\nUm you know it's one thing to watch your preparing to go through the regular on the wall where you are in their every move but there's also the aspect of family and one that was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you prepare before going out of one of these ... feet why go\nTo a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're in that stuff is\nMulti thousand for them\nYeah I mean that those and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it that because in a lot of ways reselling is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis always sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level I just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\n[noise] well I mean as scarce was asking though in the middle of a big climb I mean well let's talk about your al ... ascent yes on ... how did you think of her or is it was you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the hardest sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing the moves and just performing but then on the easier dream um I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners huh\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nYou I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nYeah well I mean ... as you write in a free so does the movie does explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free cell or climbing\nI Want and I'm like I Want to have my ... you have any I mean the guy like minds on knew\nWhat we want to do over here in a tent hanging people die\nFeel like I Want and a half way\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst with a

make decision as to having\nHad some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan and like you obviously I'd have to give up so I got on\nWith me I can do you see that as an obligation now\n[noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have you know I respect that but but I Know if you are but you know\nIs that true allergy still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nYeah it's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have that struggled through the whole film there there's so many sections or cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top of all you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know if I'm if I'm thinking about others not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah\nBut but also I mean that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently okay for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio is what is was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and I've you know finish this crime and so you know moving forward and I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially potential so short or potentially\nSo I'm I'm sure it would be different and yeah I'm sure it would be different or I don't know which way you know\nWe've got another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nYeah greetings how you're doing a ... all

was this this kid who is free sewing it and you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier and a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop

based to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of the to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump\nThe U.S engages in multilateral is them\nOnly on us terms\nSince the secretary general meeting last year we have pulled out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states is determined to obviously the involved and multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in the way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivered this message about ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf\nUh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states showing the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to

Want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success was at the un impart by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying that there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said\nShe maintained her independence she struck out a on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable or ambassador for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nShe will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration ... at the you and what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I start with the\nUh on the negative side to withdraw from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration\nKind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that in every sent her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and vitamin ... in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs are there is an administration because of exactly what\nA admirals to read it says sat there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in ... at some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI [noise] I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that\nHaley did a very good job of trying to sort

independent voter and I don't want to eat the party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took\nAs sensitive to the un she stood up to a lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to let me see that characterize\nAs right wing country and you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian camp she when she went to visit the Palestinian areas and\nMaybe what happened was that chased so that they really weren't so bad luck and um that's\nMaybe why she decided to support Israel and moved to Chicago so on\nWill Vivian Vivian let me go let column respond to you to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nUm I think the I think that the characters isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nA and came to testify before Congress and made in a passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them that\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much um [noise]\nA mood by that by that visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving\nUm the embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem there was a Security Council votes in which um she was a she was cast the veto against fourteen hundred member she was totally isolated [noise]\nUm the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were\nDefying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states would really kind of um shifted her kind of orientation Rashid became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience\nWill I'm James ... to someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some context or this first to the ... the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support and the Trump Administration support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and um Bassett or Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington

president and an Vassar Haley I'm kind of surprised that in ... during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents\nThey lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose 'em you can't\nYou can't fully your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us and former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read it how do you respond to that\nI agree with Nick burns hum and I've worked with Nick on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years he's got a a a pretty ... view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years uh gone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partnering friend in the middle east but um friends need to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked for Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region and that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is\nHow do we close that gap tactically saying things like we're going to take names\nUh is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh as they are a lot of corn ...\nOn on that has a song and maturation in his cabinet ... through the town I'm

it's a bit challenging to understand but but and James to read if I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making it more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position in language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that to the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit day would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more than my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that\nOur allies partners and friends are concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a ... a good example would be NATO during the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not a particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an
