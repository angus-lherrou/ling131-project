in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country\nWhere here every Monday through Thursday night with the latest news analysis and your calls two weeks from tonight right now even will be getting the first results\nFrom what may be the longest midterm election cycle ever and while we haven't spent much time on this program discussing what the polls are saying we're going to dig into the numbers tonight with one of the most respected pollsters in America\nBut let's start with the news of the day with Washington Post columnist Christine MBA Christine welcome back to America on the line\nThanks for having me again so Christine news of the day and the big news of the day is\nThat the president once again um well actually last night declared that he's a national as much take a listen to that again\nWants to do not care about our country so\nWe cannot have showed it became a\nWe're not supposed to do what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nAnd today when given an opportunity to clarify what he meant ah Christine the president said it again what's going on here\nWell it's always a little bit a physical to say and this is actually a scary thing whether the president or actually just as ignorant um or if he knows what he's doing but in this case I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing when he calls himself a nationalized\nI'm sensibly I think he's using he says that he's using the word um to signify something sort of in the line of being America First which he sent in the past\nUm but the word nationally specifically had fallen out of ... because it's old fashioned I'm Italian out of ... because we now associate that with white nationalist a white supremacy and racism and I think he's using this is a dog whistle um to those\nParts of his base that yes want ah\nAmerica First policies but also a little bit more interested in racism than the average voter\nAnd I are there in the ... any indicators that it is actually working is do you think that this was one of the reasons why the president's job approval rating is we talked about a lot last night has ticked up in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll up to fifty I'm Sorry forty seven percent\nYeah you know it's it's a bit hard to say if you didn't fit the using the specific word um but one of the things that we have seen in the run up to the mid term elections is that President Trump is really sort of leaning into almost the ugliest\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories ... operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications at ... dot edu\nAmerica First rhetoric that demonization of immigrants and people of color a kind of stoking fears and angers I'm among his base and his probable supporters and unfortunately as we have seen in the past several elections or anger often does more to stir voters then contentment does\nThe president is ... is also talking a lot about a middle class tax cuts that supposed to happen in a in a matter of weeks how is that possible when Congress is an even in session\nIt's not possible okay [laughter] [laughter] it is not possible at all I'm\nPresident Trump has started saying this over the past out week or two um and it is confusing everybody who hears that because yes as you say Congress has not in session\nI'm the response from senators and congressmen who are asked about this as a general sense of confusion they usually try and punt the question back\nTo the president and even when the president has been pushed to talk a little bit more about what this tax cut would be or what it would entail as he was at today with reporters in the oval office he\nCan't even explain what he means you know he can't define what the middle classes it's not entirely clear what this ten percent would look like or what effect it would have on the deficit or who would pay for it\nBut because he knows that headline is reported oh possible ten percent tax cut for the middle class is attractive at cheers voters a and I think the president knows that that's the message that's going to go forth not the nitty gritty details like Congress being getting session\nWas speaking of nitty gritty details or um other things that the president um and people in his administration have been saying\nOr is that um you know this caravan that's making its way from Central America through Mexico trying to make its way to the southern border of the U.S Mexico southern border that there are middle middle Easterners and quote\nSomewhere in the middle of this seven thousand person crowd and when push to provide any kind of back up for this ... ... the president doesn't have any ... ... ... what's going on here if you can you can it all explain\nI mean honestly I think it's it's more of the same as the mid term elections are nearing and Republicans are realizing that perhaps they weren't as far ahead or as safe as they thought the president has really resorted to obvious salsa and\nUm so yes we have this idea floated of mysterious middle class tax cuts that will appear from somewhere over the next two weeks um but then also making out this caravan um which in fact happens\nAlmost every year there was also wouldn't last year and it's usually um and reporters have said you know this caravan too is of mostly families with children who have sort of banded together to try and cross the border in safety uh that's why there are large numbers\nOr this is being painted by Trump and by his vice president Mike Pence today\nAs sort of an assortment of criminals there going back to that language about\nYou know Mexicans being rapists and sending their worst\nThe idea that they're somehow terrorists hit in in this group of people\nObviously there is no basis for that support or no basis to support that but you know it's scary and again when you know we write the headlines unfortunately\nUh the headlines sake caravan it's coming or Trump says that there are terrorists in the caravan and that scares some people and that in flames whose base and so it works even if there isn't a scrap of truth to it\nNow uh when I ask you about something that is close to our hearts mine mine and yours as a opinion writers at the Washington Post and that is the the brutal murder of ... um here's what the president ...\n[noise] we're so much for last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rig zone or get your tickets today at NPR done minutes\nSaudi Arabia and it's sort of rolling rolling disclosure\nVery bad [noise] the original concept [noise]\nIt was carried out poorly and the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups Percival bad deal should another daughter [noise] somebody really messed up [noise] and they had the worst cobra ever\nChristine they had a very bad original concept was carried out poorly what on earth is the president of the United states saying here\n[noise] [noise] well honestly he is making is very clear that he\nDoes not care about journalists about this particular event um or about you know cooling any of the very close ties that he has to the Saudi Government\nI mean this is something that's actually pretty typical of Donald Trump when you think about how he you know talked about things is not particularly interested in\nUm you know this wasn't an event to happen we see it perhaps if the death of our close colleague a as an event that has really struck fear into the hearts as journalists and dissidents or\nRight I mean first of all the only poll that you should look at election night as the exit poll and that's done by the consortium of networks and uh other news organizations you should realize that the results come in waves\nAnd so so later that night progressive some more accurate that poll is going to be\nBecause they keep filling in um\nSample sizes and I mean\nAn exit polls are only the most useful when you're looking at racism cells right when somebody is winning by you know something outside the margin of error sir ray says so let's say the exit poll is going to be very helpful\nWell that is a very good piece of advice Jennifer Duffy from the cook Political

so where are you and\nThe confidence scale confident or nervous about your side\nBy owning I'm nervous I'm a Democrat um\nI just think that this whole lot of confidence in the blue wave is seen as like kind of a sluggish confidence by the right now like everyone's just so confident that the blue waves going to take over more win back the house that for failing to see like the circumstances that made Trump a viable option and the first place [noise]\nSo you so you think it's sort of um overconfidence of of Democrats are as\nOpposed to the president you know pulling out all the stops upped overturning all those rocks from twenty sixteen and in Jeannie up I'm the same kind of want to call it excitement as he didn't twenty sixteen\nRight well of course it's all that and you know is is based get fired up on anything he does so like he basically you can't go wrong to them so\nPeople that are trying to think here like\nWe got ... ... yeah yeah [laughter] that's all right call and I

tune in the last week or so we're just a few weeks ago the battles were being fought over who would or would not protect Americans with preexisting conditions\nNow it's about President Trump vowing that he and Republicans will protect Americans from lawless moms in the streets and Middle Eastern terrorists sneaking over the southern border\nTrump was asked asked again today whether there's any proof that\nThey should have those old in the middle east sons saying what's the real bad ones but there is a good well me there's there's there's no anything\nThere's no proof of anything maybe a sentence that describes a lot of what the president says but is it a winning strategy joining me now to talk about President Trump's increasingly fear based campaign strategy is Philip bump\nNational correspondent at the Washington Post in here in Studio with me is Jamie Floyd legal affairs correspondent for WNYC thank you both very much for being on America on the line\nSo Phillips can you and you've written about this ... is it really is as simple as it seems the reason why in the closing weeks of the midterm campaign that the president is\nTurning increasingly to a fear based campaign [noise]\nUm probably I mean it's sort of you know I I'm generally low to ascribe really nuanced\nPolitical strategy to press on trial for a variety of reasons but I mean I think that\nNot only does that make sense as an explanation particularly given the way that he has spoken about this when he tweeted just yesterday or the day prior that actually that the care of animal is an issue that he needed to vote against the Democrats because of these these people who are of approaching\nThe border I mean he's been explicit in saying that he is doing this for political reasons but as I wrote yesterday I mean this is also the third election cycle or we've seen Republicans really braces strategy directly and there was a twenty four teams of people on the Islamic state has issue that\nThey wanted to get out and then in twenty sixteen from reading your campaign on this idea that America was Congress\nThreatened that immigrants from terrorists worked for for for storming our shores and you know and then all of it is none of it came came to fruition obviously for a variety of reasons but\nThis was this has been played pretty consistently\nMostly because they're not storming our shores [laughter] I mean they go low we go lower that and that's in the Trump approach to things President Trump approach to things and you know we've been here before I I've been a Jonathan spending\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications that they pass

she was never sure there are a couple of bad poll from the Midwest which made it I shouldn't say bad boys but you know creative and expect the margin of error in the Midwest which made it seem as though she was going to win states shores are going to win which\nIs that what is there is no electric I've ever encountered my entire lifetime that it's been more studied more analyzing the Trump black person we knew before election day who go to compose that electric we know now who could prices that like what we know what motivated him to the polls we've done we saw any story about this or this become\nIt's become a like a means that we know exactly who these soldiers are we know exactly what motivates them and we know in twenty sixteen I'm like Nineteen sixty\nEight those voters were not the majority of\nVoters now does that matter from a standpoint of\nWho ends up being inaugurated no it doesn't play into it is not the case that we're seeing a repeat now what we saw twenty

December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that\nStates have made it for some of their citizens to vote\nIn Georgia for example where fifty three thousand ballad applications are in limbo because of a new law and other states like North Dakota Kansas Ohio having an acted laws that make it especially difficult for minority students and the elderly to vote\nFor former attorney general Eric Holder and making it easier for people to vote and to have their votes count has become his life's work he heads the national democratic redistricting committee and we sat down to talk about how it's going\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder welcome to America on the line it's good to be here thanks for having me this is so Democrats are focused on winning back the house but you're focused on winning legislative and gubernatorial races\nWhy well uh I I first say that I think Democrats for too long hair focus really on the top of the ticket the federal level\nUm without understanding or without remembering that are on a day to day basis people's lives will probably greater more impacted by what happens at the state and local level\nAnd so in terms of impacting people's lives that's why I think we should focus there but also as the chair of the national democratic redistricting committee a focus on the state and local level so that we can make sure that we have people at the table when redistricting is done in twenty Twenty one\nUh who are committed to fare redistricting and that is determined by who will be a ... and the governor's races who will win on the governors' races and who will ah when these um state legislative races or you\nCan talk about the significance of twenty Twenty one it has to do with the census\nWhile the census has been twenty twenty and we want to make sure we have a fair census but after one year after the census occurs a redistricting occurs on twenty Twenty one\nAnd then as a process controlled by the state legislatures so how many state legislatures right now legislatures and governors mansions are controlled by Democrats [noise]\nUm I don't know the exact number but the over ... they're pretty substantial number that are controlled by Republicans and our my hope is that in twenty Eighteen will start the reversal of that trend\nContinue with through twenty twenty so that when you get to twenty Twenty one you have Democrats at the table both at the gubernatorial level and at the state legislative level\nNow in in the twenty Eighteen elections you're targeting\nTwelve states I'm I'm not that includes Nineteen legislative chambers three ballot initiatives and six down ballot races those are very specific numbers can you talk about the the significance of say the six down ballot races what\nWe're trying to do is to we have done is to ... we did a fifty state analysis\nAnd in trying to determine how we can have the greatest impact on the redistricting process we identify twelve states and then um races within those states\nThat are critical governors always matter um state legislative races matter a great deal um but when it comes to Ohio for instance the state auditor matters a great deal with regard to a fair redistricting the state secretary of state in Ohio\nI'm In certain states the Supreme Court matters more than a dozen other places and that's why we\nSupport the candidate in was in a special election in Wisconsin with regard to a state Supreme Court seat we're supporting Anita Earls who's running for\nA state Supreme Court in North Carolina so we're really targeted focused on those races they will have the greatest impact and ensure a fair redistricting process come uh twenty Twenty one\nAnd that you mentioned the position of secretary of state and right now there's one secretary of state in particular who's in the news and that is Brian Kemp the secretary of state in Georgia who is also the Republican gubernatorial nominee\n... he's a guy who is a player and a game and wants to be the umpire in the game at the same time and this is a fundamental front I think to our sense of a democracy and simple fairness he should resign as secretary of state he should resign he shouldn't just simply recuse he should resign but I mean uh in other races where\nAh in the past where secretaries of state have run for governor\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nAnd what recourse is there if he if he doesn't resign and come election day they're irregularities or there are concerns about the vote in Georgia well you know a\nFirst I'd say that people have to go get to the polls and um [noise] irrespective of\nWhat the ... they might be saying in the newspapers or the the propaganda that they are trying to put out there people need to get to the polls demand a ballot go with the appropriate dumb id and demand the ability to to cast to cast a vote\nThere also lawsuits that are undoubtedly have been filed and I'm sure it will be filed to ensure again that a fair process a curse not only in Georgia but in other states as well\nUm [noise] can efforts like at the ... those that are happening in Georgia the voter intimidation aspect of it why isn't\nThere a\nGreater outcry in terms of the um the knock on the the fairness of it\nAll well I think that you know there is a growing awareness of the unfairness of it all when you look at what's happened in North Dakota with regard to Native Americans or when you look at what's going on in Georgia with regard to those I guess fifty three thousand or so [noise] um registrations that are simply sitting on I'm Brian Kemp desk\nThere is a growing awareness among the American people that are electoral process is not being conducted in a fair way I'm Kris Kobach who's running for governor I'm In Kansas has kind of lead the way here using his secretary of state position in that state's\nThe national um attention that he got when he was part of that ill fated\nAmong electoral commission that a President Trump put together that collapsed because of its own weight [noise] um I think people are really focused on the fact that in too many places um our electric or elections are not being conducted in um in in a fair way with the California model be a better way to go and do you think\nNot nonpartisan election yeah I actually think and I think the this is the view of the ... as well that's the best way to do the redistricting process was to do it as they do it in Arizona and in California\nWhere you take it out of the hands of politicians altogether and you simply have all these independent redistricting commission so I'm drawing the lines and too many places now we have a system where politicians are picking their voters instead of voters decided who their representatives are going to be and that's why the\nNational democratic redistricting committee exactly supporting these ballot initiatives that would create a independent commissions in uh Michigan Missouri Colorado and Utah\nNow we were talking about George or before and I want to come back to Georgia because that I Would like for you to talk about\nThe comment heard around the world and that was when you said

odyssey\nInto guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio\nDot org and and our gate and just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience at this massive gun show\nIn in Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we can spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your your uh your one time father in law are uh uh he ended up actually buying you again soon at the un chosen that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their son yeah\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father might buy you a twenty two rifles so you can go on the Web it's or or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly from me which was I mean my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color baby luck ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in\nSelf defense as much as any other part I marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about ... we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding with lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting up defensive shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad been gun buying firearms and a even as far back is twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yes yeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty tend to an eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and and it is I mean we have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if\nYou come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\nHuh [noise] I I mean I guess one thing I was wondering is ... ... just before\nA un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever enter the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks uh it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called um [noise] at the time or academy sports\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd gun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nFictitious were also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do\nIt does not matter if what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong you're going to irritate them and make them mad now make you there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation\nOr even before you know I I even thought that I might entertain becoming that good with a pistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where you talk about uh the day that you got home or or ... or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had\nHad purchased for you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am it's got a lotta Oxford comma isn't it [noise] um\n[noise] that day I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open to that the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear and I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so much trouble he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love\nFear the way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pistol no larger than life just it could kill me or getting me killed\nOpen the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intrude as it was the process of

let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey\nInto guns or an art J just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association a I I'm just wondering what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there's multiple there were a bunch of reasons why\nThe association was formed a protection to the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about\nA African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got to profile dug for the book you know\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you found a western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at

historical aspect of\nGuns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\nSo I'm just wondering I [noise]\nI I hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of uh African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise] but\nAh RJ did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was illegal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speech more to watch the n._r._a. should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like Doug Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nI'm going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member chaos you shut up\nAnd I have on a Black Panther sure Scott ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I have on a Black Panther ... what kind of stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have a lot better braided up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't gonna be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not um I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go around is is that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room\nIs not bigger than any elephant you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say\nAnd that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist than I Am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to find out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if he shared that desire you actually felt less safe a ... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma\nAnd he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh his attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect

workplace accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask for combinations from your employer uh and got them or were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm\nHaving your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your

an employer how much combination can you make and what are the real estate concerns that employers have about the limits too accommodating employees during pregnancy again we're at eight hundred for two three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there if you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas in two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't except you know because we have\nWater and see because the water fountains available to you I was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of becoming this big deal and they read history and I think my God I decided to go

stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common to experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me too has and\nWe were shocked\nStreaming of New England public radio was wounded boy you all energy solar helping homes businesses firms in western New England save money and the

story and miscarriage I can say that uh we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal than devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine the the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to the extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate meal go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah exactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again just when I talk to people who are still working at the warehouse so these are folks who\nAre at again\nGreat personal risk coming forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that uh the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their mid your second story most of them that where they work\nTo the company not also said that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently though their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were\nManufactured drummed out than exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned that\nNone of so with the exception of one on one end\nI'm Tasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record show we and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm\nA pretty basic set of disputed facts so for instance we describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as ... and window is\nThey just beat the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't have the sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than\nSay you know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now and there's an interior window I can see out into the whole way of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I can also see hot

I mean pregnant is\nStood on fours and watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know hey they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like pick somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs Ninety eight pounds\nShe can't lift like I Can't get to some of those are simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights they screw pick on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I share you actually in and I want to turn your uh called back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but a least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr and give me a second you just had this up right because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy young doctors that she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put at risk of miscarriage\nOr so she was told to stay home or me she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way it is up to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy young described what happened\nTo the doctor that with my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't have I ... for ... sake Hong ...\nI should say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but generally is my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent in that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr it's a really interesting to see that and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that prohibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees\nThen it gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer show first pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney pay pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions\nTo workers who cannot work because of childbirth which he says it's implausible that current federal law\nWhich elsewhere creates a guarantee of equal treatment here alone creates a guaranteed a fever treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true um does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad\nWe have so much one last year with new new New England public radio certain then you'll just be Nineteen twenties holiday party that or do you remember Bruce who do more open your blood red zone you use the euro does\nOr doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes needs to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because a pregnancy needs to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with the pregnancy\nAnd blue collar context and I think about what Joanna said she said we can do the work I remember reading a one woman saying oh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what Joanna saying\nI'm often and blue collar context women can do the work but the employer my sense and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these women in the first place and so figures great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on leave and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... not just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers Fairness Act and that's been a kind of center piece of um efforts to strengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination act\nThere have been efforts since so every congressional sessions twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced the pregnant workers Fairness Act\nSo far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the um help committee which stands for house and labor and pensions I'm not going to get the exact terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um\nIt has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support I'm\nKind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander I'm his home state is um where ex PO a where that X. P. O. warehouses made in Tennessee\nAnd and so you but you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any ... you'd have never even advance to a motor debate\nIt's never been put on the floor and now it's your right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop back to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking isn't the right direction\nIt's taken us in the right direction and in fact something like twenty two states already have similar provisions there should be a national law that says\nUm [noise] workers are sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do on the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do have sweeping rights and they actually have rights even if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so any pregnant worker who was in a situation like those described in the article or listening", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "24"}
