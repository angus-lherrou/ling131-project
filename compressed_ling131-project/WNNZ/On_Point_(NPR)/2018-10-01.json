we're talking with some top reporters about what to look ahead for in this week's news Caitlin Huey burns joins us she CBS News digital political reporter pure Thomas is also with us chief justice correspondent for ABC News\nAnd Michael Moore joins us to today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention a focus on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett Kavanaugh a and we've got lots of comments here on our website on point radio dot org\nJohn in Amherst says lying and allegations aside as someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone the Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday\nA and here's what he described he saw and Brett Kavanaugh's temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week\nWhen I heard him or her and someone who\nI Hope our would sound like if I had been unjustly accused\nAnd to see his family behind him is Chris and uh\nIt was there was anger um but um\nBut if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and correspondence Scott Kelly ask tunes are about the the claim or the assertion or the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made for his advocates and defenders on the committee made you wonder about it should be building\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to serve other bad\nThat's democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there\nAnd I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here are keenly he burns let me just pick up with you 'cause you're speaking to this point before\nThe break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focus on their call for an investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation and you know its current term they may not like but I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about\nThe Clintons 'em\nAnd you know that perhaps some folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nRight I think that paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because um remember we're talking about they see as the potential swing seats\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nPerspective but when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a part a sense I'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if that conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question in the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's ability for the court or the question though and that the point that I Would make is that\nYou know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about half an hour even before these allegations surfaced yet many Democrats come out as soon as Kavanaugh was nominated or shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans\nAre really cheering him on\nSo there is a question of you know how much the events of ... that we learned last week how much we learned this week\nHow much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering\nThat the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them in election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to cabinet as a personality and his fitness for the court\nWill Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nA man that I think if that's where the argument shifts as as Kaitlin suggest to might\nUm it suggest that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court ah to the Supreme Court I mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a ... that his uh his testimony his anger\nIn that are in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be\nWhat we're not hearing is any sort of analysis of his actual time on the bench she's a he said on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful or courts in the country and this claim about or his partisanship has never been made a\nPerhaps it perhaps somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't\nI'm a ... and I think Jeff Flake is getting it something here remember flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament of what really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski a and Jeff Flake a change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which\nCabinet responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so if if the the investigation finds out the capital has lied about this or has a lot about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators\nHall or take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the Iraq\n[noise] Ricky they're so high yeah go ahead ray\nAh I really don't have too much faith that he will not be pushed on a district court so I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps for civic lesson if he is a appointed and confirming\nUm when will he will have to decide how many cases yes to recuse himself because it is a blast it allowed to carry it or the uh Clinton years and there are conspiracy or to the other members of the court to\nDecide [noise] one of the recusal should and should not be used\nStreaming of New England

you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice Kavanaugh if so if he so becomes his ability to fairly Jew Decatur case like that [noise]\nYou know it's interesting um\nA lot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on the invoking the Clinton for example that some people thought that that was a a bit too much in terms of the judgment

I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office saying here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nBut we don't know if they have to go back to the White House who say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident can we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that\nUh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most again\nThe question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI pursues the questions that they want answered but at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right\nWell it's in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred or who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill a little bit different era now [laughter]\nSo so much has so much and yet so little at the same time as change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he\nTold Scott Kelly or that if he had been running for reelection\nHis decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCooking who have done this\nIf you were running out of ... or ... show\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and

that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael what I'm saying here also is just a recent study from Hugh that says that uh Seventy six percent of the potential midterm voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics is as much about ah who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you are not like who do not want to see\nIn power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been in organizing forest for Democrats who who sort of woken up uh in our own are expecting a a good election in the midterms um\nMy question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a have been energized huh I don't think the Trump Administration as it's gone on a has given him Republicans much to be excited about\nPerhaps a and we'll have to wait to see a polling is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week\nUm perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege many uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that ah that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite\nA view that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment\nUm ah as make them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters or in a way that uh that that that does energize them to get out of the ... ah in November ...\nIn fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his orders and saying you know if you want to\nPreserve the uh the futures of ... judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look at we've got so many comments on our website emptying yards saying\nThat's a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women at the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to
