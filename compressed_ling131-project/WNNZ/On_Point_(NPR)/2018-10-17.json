Associated Press national politics reporter Hi Lisa thanks for coming on welcome to America on the line\nBrian thanks for having me so this just broke a couple of hours ago and it was from an AP interview right how the president is comparing Saudi Arabia to Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nThat's right our White House reporter said sit down with President just a little while ago and we have a number of stories coming out this evening from that interview\nOne advantage have posted online now in circulating ... and he said you know the president has very Dan I'm leaning into this idea in Saudi Arabia some on his parents from a case that they've seen journalist and he called the um for portrayed ferret in the interview\nHe said quote you know I think we have to find out what happened first and here we go again with you now you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that he said we just went through that with justice cabin on humans and than all the way he's really kind of carrying Saudi Arabia\nOn that and whether or not they often\nI found that the government there in Saudi Arabia of life at all involved getting to the parents have ... the funny at the end colonel asked to have gone in to the consulate faring just involved and never return and he um president is\nIsraelis sort of questioning whether or not the government\nHere's NPR's offering us Federal Reserve will be a long term storage as baby overturning on Saturday December first grab your tickets no you're not\nThere may have been a involvement there and it is something that is of course a massive investigation right now in Turkey has they uncover what happened two weeks ago when that journalists went into the consulate on Henry King paperwork and and never return to\nTell us a little bit about what's been shaping up in that investigation today because with Kevin uh\nOne could argue certainly his supporters argue that there was some evidence but it was far from conclusive regarding Dr ... Ford how's the evidence been shaping up especially today for people who may not have been following the news during business hours\nRegarding the disappearance of Washington Post columnist ...\nYeah I mean these are just really two very different cases and that sort of conflate them as the president has just just just says it's just a different line of sort of thinking than\nThan the way a lot of people are thinking of the situation of course the situation with the judge happened\nYou know allegedly thirty five years ago in this situation here with the Saudi ... a writer it unfolding before our very eyes so I'm the a P has to report after stumble tonight that says that you know the police are searching the Saudi a consulate there and I'm\nI'm believe they have found um you know some evidence that he was in fact\nKilled there and they're continuing the investigation and so you know there is um a lot of pressure right now on Saudi Arabia to explain what happened you know constantly that you know it's a government building it's where you go to do\nYou know official business and to have a citizen not someone who is of the country going to you know their home state building there in a foreign country and have\nThem disappeared as you know Mary uh unusual and so you know why was the country um and I you know perhaps on able to um protect a\nYou know the journalist and in that country it just raises enormous amounts of questions and of course you have the Republican senators here in Congress which is you know where I'm at covering Capitol Hill I'm a\nVoting offices let me let me jump in on that because we have a clip of just what you were starting to refer to and here's one place where the comparison between tub and on and the Saudis\nCertainly breaks down Kavanaugh had Senator Lindsey Graham fiercely in his corner on this question of guilty until proven innocent he was Lindsey Graham today on Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman who Graham refers to here as in the U.S\nThere's a difference between the country and an individual thing NBS figure there's to me toxic he can never be a world leader on the world to what is the president do thank us up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm going to do on sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia\nSo once Trump being in in defense of the Saudis when even his own party in Congress has not\nYet you know um I I Can't answer that fully you know I think the country a United States and Saudi Arabia have long and deep ties of course Saudi Arabia was the\nFirst uh foreign visit President Trump made and twenty Seventeen after he took office so um and there's been a relationship there for a very long time between these countries in the relationship or have any turbulence and that relationship obviously\nI'm as difficult but that's exactly what you're seeing and this division as you mentioned between\nUm ... senators I'm Lindsey Graham of course being the most outspoken but you know a number of senators I\nCame out last week and signed on to a letter I'm sort of starting the clock on these sanctions that could could happen there could be fall on on Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI'm In a hundred and twenty day clock that the Senate started um um and the president will have to respond to that and decide whether or not to\nUm hold Saudi Arabia accountable 'em and see you know what what the decision is on on this\nStreaming of New England public radio is one of the un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nSenate here for the it was almost unanimously by the U.S senators on the Foreign Relations committee to uh to launch that I'm a hundred and twenty days sanctions clock but you know you barely see that kind of cooperation anymore here on Capitol\nHill right and so it was a real indication that I'm the president is a bit out on his own on the court secretary\nPump pale Mike compare the secretary of state uh went over to Saudi Arabia today um and he's meeting with NBS I'm been solemn um on on the issue I'm ... and and so we'll\nSee you know where the investigation goes um the the us than it is a bit isolated on this\nIs my guest is Lisa ... from the Associated Press a ... interview with the president was today was that late in the day that it actually took place\nYes it was just a a I think are the stories are just posting here within the last hour or so it was in the afternoon as a as far as I Know a\nLot of a little bit to track of time you know maybe a couple of hours ago yeah\n'cause uh I guess up until then like other Trump had no listed scheduled today and he seems to have spent the day tweeting or were you counting I Know some of the media was camping I think they were up to Seventeen and mid afternoon something like that which is high even for him\nReally began the process of building the machinery of spin as it's attached to the American presidency so before the twentieth century\nPresence really weren't out there all that much making public statements trying to mobilize the public and it was Teddy

mid term elections we'll talk now about how the steady stream of rough and tumble news about politics and the increasing tenuous relationship of things that are said to be fat and truth\nIs affecting many of us in somewhat less than clinical terms\nThe news is making it was crazy so we brought in an expert Dr Cindy bound Baker a clinical psychologist who is joining us from Philadelphia\nAnd her take is neither political nor predictable she's got so many scenarios of individuals from left right and other working through their feelings about the country today in various ways couples to so welcome Dr bound Baker\nThank you very much glad to be here\nAnd listeners will take your calls at eight four four seven four or five talk is the news or the political environment being reported on by news outlets stressing you out how are you dealing with it are you cutting back on news are you watching more news I think we'll hear his story of that as a way to cope\nFrom our guest healthy you're dealing with it how can your experiences help your fellow listeners to cope or what questions might you have for a doctor Ben Baker aid for for seven four or five talk eight four four seven four or five eight to five five eight four or five eight four four I'll do that one more time aid for for\nSeven four or five talk\nUm you have so many interesting scenarios let's run a few before went through a few before we take some calls from listeners\nI'm One of the stories you tell this off the air is one member of spousal unit is anxious so she's wanting to watch the news all the time the husband just turned off by that because watching the news is making him anxious can you talk about that couple and what they represent\nYes sure um you know anxiety management is been really a challenge for a number of people\nAnd we all manage her anxiety differently so for some people the more information they get the more they can reduce their anxiety and for other people the more information they get the more their anxiety ratcheting up\nAnd the problem happens when you have a couple\nA where one wants to be listening to the news and watching TV all the time\nSo that his anxiety can uh be lessened and his wife is somebody who when she sees Donald Trump or shares news starts getting more and more anxious\nSo it's affected couples it's affected individuals I I Want to piggyback on something David\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nOnly believe you know when the president tells them they haven't seen what they know they've seen and I would say he's not making us crazy but he's crazy making\nAnd it's in the crazy making that people are having difficulty if you if you think of anxiety right how anxieties felt sense of no control and unpredictable future a feeling of no escape\nAnd when people have that sense\nAnd if they start worrying and worrying worrying they can well we call ruminate are worried they're way down to depression\nAnd we of course depression is also the stuff I've lost so these are the things I mean I can give you a some clinical scenarios these are some of the things people are talking about a lot in my office\nSo let me ask you how you would resolve the first scenario um that you laid out where you have one spouse who wants to watch the news a lot to reduce her anxiety but watching the news makes the husband more anxious how would you counsel a couple like that\nIn a case like that um she's gonna have to be watching or she is going to be have to be watching the news um when she's not in the bedroom or in the living room um and it's a reduction in their shared time\nI'm a you know it's the the best way to do it I'm there I had one couple that just decided that the bedroom with off limits\nFor the news\nAnd um they sort of you know like we do with little kids and we said there are certain rules that you can bring your toys and in certain room the cat there are certain ruined in this house you can listen to the news in certain ones you can't\nLet me raise one other scenario of yours for listeners before we go to a phone call is\nI'm ... and this really crosses party lines is is not about you taking a political position as many as are and so you've talked about how\nMany Democrats are feeling betrayed\nAnd ending by their representatives to sense that yes you know somebody should open their mouth\nAnd say this is crazy but many Republicans are feeling Shonda and rejected and wounded and not understood and they're feeling even silence because so many Democrats are feeling this rage can you compare and contrast\nWell you know everybody's pain of course has their own pain I think\nThat if I'm at somebody who works with a couples as well as individuals with couples oftentimes it's helping one understand the other the communication here each other more I think the issues run deeper now in the divide I think\nThat um as you say Democrats are feeling really betrayed and Republicans are feeling so rejected and miss understood\nUm and nobody's trusting anybody so when we're we're living in two worlds right we're listening to two different news if that's even the word I don't know how many were holed up yet is now um [noise] and we're told the\nPress is the enemy of the state so then\nWho can be trusted so people aren't trusting each other and with how a sense of trust\nYou know our whole socio emotional world becomes a very dangerous place\nAnd and you see an outgrowth of this and it's sort of sense of paranoia [noise] um and and you see this and the object of being a phobia and what's happening with the immigrant families in separating the kids and people in tent cities is terrible or Charlottesville as a\nYou know an example of that so [noise] uh\nMaking a lot of people certainly\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay past dot edu\nFor the people who are pinning their hopes on it um\nBecause it is a perfect example of this and I I Hope this addresses it a little bit um I I went to get lunch today I was in the elevator and I wear this button that says moms demand action from gun control\nAnd this stranger in the elevator said to me you know the trouble with today is that we're in so much trouble and there's nothing we can do\nAnd that's exactly what you just said to me I feel this sense of learned helplessness like what can I Do and boy oh boy November better come

suffered as a top tier NASCAR driver\nA he's a two time winner of the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR as most popular\nDriver award and a earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand twelve but those were not his first I mean in the book Dale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race and his head hit\nSo here's two and he was offering a special treat he'll be a long time for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December first grab your tickets no you're not\nThe eight

pause that's what everyone hope that all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a beer than in the car was the only thing that really helped me decide\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was and how long I needed to get better so I Know better next time I syndicated as sacred as much as I did but\nYou know I didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't a serious I guess everybody has made it out to be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program\nAnd he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve he also wrote the forward for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on point\nHigh maintenance or it's really great to have you because obviously as as Dale writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office I mean you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes\nI mean what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him shut deal twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale we actually got Dale better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was very sick with these issues that we commonly see with concussion\nAnd quite honestly I I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd I just jump in here though because I mean the the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems uh all the all the things I hand eye coordination all\nThe things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving at two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life um\nYou know it's a racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar initially saw Dale and\nAnd you know we really identified will learn a lot about concussion and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the labyrinth signals coming from and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with Dale and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and set amount of course of rehab that um that eventually got him better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh but Mickey Collins who I think one thing that surprised me about what they wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nPerhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when a brain as healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment we've actually identify now that there are six different types of concussions and there was some types of concussions were quote unquote\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nProfile of difficulties the way you treat the problems that Dale had is actually ... training and so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach a whether the rate regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again whereas the average single coming from and then and then matched the right treatment to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous because this is thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah well Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\n[noise] yeah actually that was so ah interesting I guess I'm you know a\nHearing from retire drivers or even drivers that had a just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and looking and just really just to be able to contact Mickey had to get to Pittsburgh where he was in and see him [noise] um that was\nI think the beginning of the reason for writing this book and Mickey has told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know\nEncourage them through the process and then I made some pretty good friends to\nSorry to interrupt you there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nUh you are so concerned freaked out really about uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve that that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did not why was that so profound for you\nThat you know he did that on a couple occasions\nHad I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I

Harvard shows a pattern of marching down Asian American students for for no real reason other than\nPerhaps bias shore so let me address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first statistically\nThey're saying the Asian Americans are consistently rated\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSo they organize the data by academic desk dial which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA and they're saying that\nAnd the students and the highest ... who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups but I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic dial because it doesn't\nNecessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic dial than there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you and sort of a step back here for ... big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the back of your case and in two thousand three ... three ball injure Harvard's admission process these have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions at the right way to ease racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that you see\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was a fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell who was Powell was the only one who looked harbored\nAnd fought the its approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him at the point that remained in the category of Supreme Court ducked the all the way the two souls and treat when in the ... case\nSandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect polls eccentric opinion and makeup law the land\nSo now the U.S Supreme Court house and not instance said that the the pursuit of diversity taken some code of racial preferences would be a suitable thing the colleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but that they could do it\nAnd that's where the law stands on those who was reaffirmed in the Fisher case a few years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been the steak all along which is should the United states be a country that all ... law the land is titled six of the\nOf civil rights act like teen sixty four that no person in the United states show on the grounds of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in order to nudge the benefits to

that harbored which has the dome and meld thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and manner that could accommodate students who are qualified and leap long in as students\nUh Nicole gone to what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nSure so I Do want to push back against um this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consideration in the admissions process is objective and I think there's a lot of
