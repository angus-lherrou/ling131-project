H. eighty nine three immersed\nIn partnership with Amherst College and UMass Amherst it's eight o'clock\n...\n[noise] from WNYC radio and Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line alive political news and call in show about the midterms from WNYC and public radio stations across the country every Monday through Thursday night where here with news analysis and your calls\nWe want to hear your opinions on the issues that matter most to you know coming up we'll be joined by one of the Democrat's biggest funders Tom's dire who's best known these days where his knee to impeach organization\nIt's not winning him a lot of popularity contests within the Democratic party in fact party leaders seemed to be running the other way\nBut let's start though with the political news of the day and for that we're joined by the Washington bureau chief for huff post Amanda Terkel Amanda welcome back to America on the line\nGreat to be here so as we speak actually the president of the United states president Donald Trump is in Texas is doing a rally for a man he used to call lion head but now he calls him this\n\nBeautiful Ted Texas Ted Amanda please explain what's happening here\n[laughter] while Tetris needs to win his election against a very charismatic fat or work and Trump is still popular in Texas so she is following his pride he is letting Trump campaigned for him and he is for getting the fact that Trump during the campaign uh\nBasically accused Cruz's father of assassinating JFK and talked about how ugly cruises wife was I mean\nIt's a little gross that Ted Cruz is willing to just move on and overlook all that's really awful personal\nSlights and and you know that Trump bluffs it you know Trump is out there campaigning for people like Cruz who ... who didn't like him and now they desperately need him in order to win so basically a Trump is more popular than a lot of Republican lawmakers and they are embracing him\nI remember him in and maybe you were also there in Cleveland in the hall when Ted Cruz spoke at the Republican convention and criticize Donald Trump from the podium and was booed off the stage at my how things have changed in the last two years\n[noise] yeah I Do remember that too I mean there was it was an intense Republican primary and I was also there and I remember that bowling and now you know beautiful tad a Trump I think his approval rating in general is up maybe a he had that for for a\n... his approval rating four percent more favorable unfavorable and you know cruise is not a great campaign our federal rockets out they're racing record amounts of money getting people in Texas excited getting people around the country excited\nAnd in the last debate he went on the offensive against crews and Cruz is sort of doing whatever he can and we are seeing some of that is just overlooking everything he ever set about Trump and just for getting it happen now here's the thing ...\nWe're so much one last year we're doing it again New England public radio certain and you'll just be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the who to vote in your blood red zone or get your tickets to anything or ... minutes\nPresident Obama raised a\nAt all at one point during his presidential runs\nAnd as you said he's very charismatic there seemed to be a big wave of enthusiasm for him around the country and then a poll came out about a week ago the shows that they don't work is behind Ted Cruz has always been the dynamic in that campaign that this really is\nA race for Ted Cruz to lose\nAbsolutely I mean there is a very good chance uh\nEven though Cruz is not running the best campaign and he's not a great campaigner odd that he will still when Texas is still a red state he is still a Republican and he will probably win but the fact that it's been so close and Republicans are so worried about it and watching it so closely\nJust shows a sort of the strengths of Beddoes campaign like you said he's raised a record amount of money it's more money than Jeb Bush raised during his entire presidential run in twenty sixteen and he is really changing things for the way Democrats and maybe Republicans\nFundraiser going forward relying on small dollar donors are treating his\nSupporters and funders with respect sort of different than some of the spam that you see coming from the other party committees\nSo his influence will be felt long after the race even if he loses\nSo amendment ... there was some action uh in court along the lines of cases involving voter suppression was there not\nRight and we saw in New Hampshire\nFar from Texas out judging right Hampshire\nOn today today black to state law that would have required additional documentation from voters\nWho moved to the state within thirty days of an election and we're starting to see this pop up in a few other places Georgia most notably wherever voters who said that they're going to be able to vote suddenly aren't going to be able to if they don't fix something and might not be able to at all because\nThere are discrepancies in Georgia for example uh your your registration what you fill out the form must match exactly what the state has that file and there ... all be start to clerical errors there might be a drop tight fitting there might be a small\nA number issue if that doesn't match and you don't challenge it you can't vote but the problem is that somebody said that they never knew there was a problem and so they may show up on election day and they may not be able to vote and the real\nIssue here I said it's predominantly affecting voters who are minorities\nAre looks jumped from New Hampshire\nAnd voter suppression in across the world to to turkey and the latest in the investigation and the latest on the the murder\nOf ... my colleague at the Washington Post and the opinion section of the latest news Amanda is that the CIA director Jenner hassle is on her way to turkey what's the significance of the [noise]\nWell it's significant because I mean she's ahead of U.S intelligence services obviously and Turkish officials so far has been a little leery about sharing what they have which includes the audio that captures the killing and so\n... Gina Haspel supposedly will be able to hear and see what the Turkish officials have which is they say clear evidence that the Saudis\nWere involved in deliberately killing change could show key and then the question is whether this intelligence and what the CIA director cheese will be enough to convince Trump and his administration that sure enough the Saudis and the crown prince were involved\nNow the Turkish leader everyone is promising details tomorrow at least in our time should be early early tomorrow morning any idea how as to how forthcoming or the Turkish leader will be in those details\nI don't know yet but you would ... I think that they are going to be increasingly forthcoming I mean the the details we've learned so far\nAre just unbelievable that they brought a guy who looked like James ... so that they could pretend he wasn't that he could dress in his claws\nStreaming of New England public radio was fun to go you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nMedical expert who specialized in autopsies and then you have the Saudis out there saying that no no no this was just a fist fight that bad\nI said the details that Turkish officials have released so far I have been pretty incredible and now I think what some people are waiting for it that this initiative audio to show them talking about the killing\nAnd now let's bring it back to North America and the story that I'm sure the president has probably brought up in his rally by now and that is the caravan of migrants who are making their way from Central America through Mexico trying to make their way to the ... the border between the United states and Mexico\nThe president is saying that this is all the Democrats fault I'm\nIn fact today\nSarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary told reporters that President Trump was quote app as\nAbsolutely she says credible evidence or Middle East middle Easterners in the Margaret caravan have we seen any evidence to back that up\nNow there is no evidence to back that up a that's just simply an attempt to make it seem that these people are are scary that they are trying to come here to commit violent crimes if not terrorist attacks it's just honestly racist fear mongering [noise]\nVoters necessarily want to see him in the south or particular states this may be a very targeted effort for him to go there but I think that you know part of the larger problem with the Democrats right now is that\nSo many elected officials are focusing on Trump is be Trump is bad\nBut they're not necessarily putting forth a vision healthcare has passed and you know we see the Republicans consistently trying\nOut we well we've got less than a a less than a minute we're all coming back in the ... in in the back half of the show will pick up all of these things because I also want to ask all of you why is it that President Trump's approval ratings given everything that's happened\nHas ticked up to forty seven percent in the NBC News Wall Street journal poll they talked about that is it still would have enough of them will talk about that after we come back on the panel will be back later in the show when\nWe return as promised Hampshire one of the Democratic party's biggest donors here to talk about the chances of blue wave and it's personal project impeachment you're listening to America on the line\nOr news network is funded by you and the willingness to Northampton middle school hosting an open house for grid seven days on Monday November shift from six thirty two eight information that will ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield ...

from WNYC\nAnd public radio stations around the country\nYou've seen my next guest on television or billboards encouraging Americans to join his effort to impeach President Trump Tom ... is the Democratic party donor and founder and leader of need to impeach\nAnd while need to impeach has six million signatures in his report it to be the biggest voter list in politics\nThere are plenty of democratic leaders who wish he would just stop talking about impeachment here's Nancy Pelosi\nSo let's focus on that would not be my plan\nWould not be your plan to charge them and I have enough people on my back to the president [noise] it's fine\nAgain with the information that comes forward and\nTemperament that as nontraditional that that will do the right thing\nAnd then there's former vice president Joe Biden\nAnd if Democrats win the house do you believe that they knew for with article I Hope they don't\nI don't think there's a basis for doing that right\nI think we should wait until the report comes out\nThere talking about Utah's dire welcome to America on the line\nJonathan thank you for having me by the way I knew that [laughter]\nAnd a reminder to listeners we want to know how you feel about candidates who talked about impeaching to president either for or against call us at eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five so yeah they're talking about you [noise] they're saying that this is not a good idea we shouldn't be talking about this and yet there you are there you have been for more than a year now\nJust a little over a year we started October twenty twenty Seventeen hammering\nAway saying the president must be impeached so reminder what what was it that made you deep dip into your own pockets buy airtime to say we need to impeach the president\nWhen we look at it in two ways Jonathan one is that she met\nThe criteria to be impeached and we've got fifty four constitutional scholars we had them on our website need to impeach dot com both in December of last year in June of this year and honestly it's all laid down hand I I think with vice president Biden is talking about is frankly\nNonsense that this was a president who has overt is the most corrupt president in American history he overtly takes payments from foreign governments on a daily basis something is absolutely prohibited by the constitution so called among all humans and ...\nHe said publicly that the reason he fired the head of the FBI was just shut down the Russian thing so I think that there has been an attempt\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot\nCom a practical thing before the election because they're worried that it will inflame Republicans and drive them to the polls isn't that right know let let's be clear here\nWe went and looked at five thousand Republican ads\nZero of which talked about impeachment so if it's such a great issue to inflame Republicans why do is zero out of five thousand ads talking about it what we should be asking is a completely different question and I think that we see\nThe midterm elections and what we're trying to do diametrically differently from the elite democratic people inside the beltway and here's what they think they think forty five percent of Americans vote in a midterm election\nOne to two percent can't figure out if they liked the president whether Brett Kavanaugh is not a responsible person to be a Supreme Court justice and so we should cozy up to that one to two percent we should be Republican light we should not say anything that will offend them or inflamed them what\nWe say something completely different we're a grassroots organization we're doing the largest grassroots\n... youth organizing Eighteen to thirty five which to me is used in the history of America this year we say forty five percent of Americans vote which is the past history in midterms that means fifty five percent don't vote\nSo rather than going to get the one to two percent in the middle and trying to make sure we don't offend them how about if we tell the truth\nHow about if we stick up for the American people how about if we do the right thing and get the fifty five percent who don't think it's worth it to show up to show up ...\nWhat time do you mean I I hear you when you talk about\nYou know Democratic Party elites in Washington who are against this and they don't want to do because they're cozying up\nBut there are nine Washington\nElites who don't like the idea of talking about impeaching the president the\nWell to me actually if you go to the videotape Jonathan and go to polls you will see that Seventy eight percent of Democrats want this president impeached and removed from office\nThat the other twenty two percent about half of them don't and half of them don't know so actually when you talk about Democrats and you're talking about normal citizens who are registered as Democrats they overwhelmingly agree with us\nThat in fact more Americans think he should be impeached and removed from office then dumped so actually when we're talking about Democrats it's overwhelmingly that the people around the country agree with us\nActually okay so I'm at the beginning of the show and before the segment I ask people to call in whether they are for or against an effort to impeach the president I asked people to call a a four four seven four or five eight to five five TI in St Louis called in the air thank you for calling into America on the line\nHere welcome so\nWould you like to see President Trump impeached for not impeached\nNot impeach ... anything that your

Want\nFor twenty twenty to show that the majority of the American people do not want that kind of leadership and any more [noise]\nGreat leaves me being not impeached already\nAt the ballot box T I

question well\nWe had a lot of talk about impeachment for the last what were the last twenty minutes I don't want to ask about that question anymore let's whatever is on your mind that is not impeachment related give us a call eight four four seven four or five eight to five five when I Do want to uh talk about is to actually go back\nA and Christina I Want to get your um your thoughts\nOn the immigration discussion that we were having at the beginning of the show to Doug Doug gave his thoughts Maria gave her thoughts but when you are listening and are shaking your head and not and so I Want to know what you were thinking or what you think about all this\nI mean I I Do think that this is part of Trump's greatest hits you know when he has not produced the wall which is the main thing that his supporters in his base want but he can sort of whip out the\nRacist rhetoric whenever necessary and I do think that he will use these visuals to his advantage\nSo many of his supporters have forgotten that they to our children and grandchildren of immigrants they may not necessarily being from Latin America they may be from Europe but they've forgotten that they came to this country oftentimes not with matching often times of the country that didn't necessarily want them even though they were from Europe\nI'm thinking of people who were coming from Italy and Ireland and rain aries and all these other places we're now in Germany and Poland all of a sudden now it's time to shut the borders and I do think that Trump will use this visual because unfortunately so many of his supporters\nDon't see families they don't see children we've seen his supporters say you know these women don't want their children taken away from them and they shouldn't be coming to the border and what they are not understanding of the things\nThat America does to other nations that make it such that people need and want to leave\nI there's so many economic things that this country does to others um either starving them on providing them with you know propping up dictators are putting in you know sort of military regimes and the people have to leave their nation\nOr has been reported MS Thirteen at the president goes on about is actually a California export yeah when the folks are depleted and we know and resident\nDoesn't like nuance and so the fact that he will just throw in oh yeah and I think I see some Middle Eastern middle Easterners we also know that you know Fox News and in his talk radio Sarah gets will pick that up\nAnd carried as truth and unfortunately his supporters they don't need to look for facts they just want to know that whatever it is that they had in this country is quote unquote being taken away from them\nAt the the timing of all of this is also very curious how all of a sudden that jogging about thousands of people making they're making their way north if anybody wants to to to touch on that please jumped in but\nHaving said all that and this is something that I wanted to get to in the in the first segment of the the show and we couldn't get there's going to get there now\nPresident Trump's job approval rating after everything we have seen and been through has ticked up Doug\n... forty seven percent in the latest NBC News Wall Street journal poll ... what is going on here why is it the Kavanaugh bumps still or is it something else for both well I think I think it is important\nBumped up really brought a lot of um Republicans home um and some of that as natural as you get to the waning days of of Ryan cycle anyways\nUm it's also a robust economy that are basically every week we hear a more good news about and that's something that Trump can can ... and and run on frankly I Wish you do more about\n'em and I'll tell you Jonathan I saw that I'm told us pretty close up in um Nashville where I was about a month ago and um and how it impacts the Senate races people were [noise] ah that I talked to were very torn I'm even Blackburn supporters\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools MS and applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nWere voting for him and most voters think the person that they're voting for is going to win 'em and British and was was really hurt by the fact that for a long time\nShe wouldn't take a position on um the capital nomination even though that's something he would vote on um as a senator and ultimately I'm at the very end so that he supported them so he he lost a lot of credibility in the state\nUm and that's part of the cabinet bumped it has has affected trumping and certainly a lot of Republican candidates as well one thing I'll say is a point of comparison a when I was at the Republican National committee in two thousand ten\nUh our magic number for ... was I'm forty six we felt if he was below that on election day or that that we'd win back the house and\nYou know we're obviously not election day yet but I don't think anybody would think that the uh you know a year ago that Donald Trump would be one point two points higher than ... Bible was given that the districts\nToday are um more homogeneous I'm more I'm favoring incumbents then then that was the case in two thousand ten uh this is good news for Republicans in for the first time maybe they don't have windows their backs but they don't feel that they're running head first into a a very scary when Martin I'm Maria\nDi ...\nGreed that Democrats should be concerned and I have always been one to\nWarn against talk of the blue wave because we have always known that Trump is completely unpredictable we don't know what his effect on elections are we all thought twenty sixteen was going to do one lane and didn't\nAnd I I I think that it will still be a good day for Democrats are there are a lot of things that are going on in the district\nThat are heavily favor Democrats the candidates that we haven't been able to\nRecruit has been phenomenal they hadn't been running on health care they had been running on an economy that has only worked for the point zero one percent they had been running on a tax scam that Republicans have passed that has not help the middle class or working class voters\nWell actually we are they they hadn't been running on the on the tax cuts and that reminds me to\nLet her know Democrats are that are ... are now because we haven't gotten anything or will reiterate exactly exactly so I Am sorry to cut you off but no ... on Doug on on the tax cuts that was this huge\nAccomplishment or that the Republicans and the president got through there is to like ... on the rose garden of the White House and yet they're crickets\nOn the campaign trail when it comes to this why aren't Republicans running up to a midterm election championing the number one thing that they've been talking about for decades\nWell I think to some extent they are they're talking about the economy and ultimately the Republican argument is and you can agree with it or disagree with it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nPeople in his district face every single day in New Jersey with fewer than three weeks until the midterms repealing Obamacare as a major issue in a hotly contested congressional race in the issue is leaving many voters on the\nI don't know I'm a I'm a little bit on the\nThat's tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\nThe second hour of on point is next\nThis is the any PR news network\nWINZ am six forty Westfield WINZ FM Ninety One Seventy airfield WFCR eighty eight five eighty three Amherst W and then you eighty nine five great Barrington WMA nine Ninety eight nine Adams double UAIC Ninety One nine Springfield and W.

health care system may influence their vote\nOr in these midterm races which we can stay with Jonathan Cohn he's national is a senior national correspondent at huff post covering health care social welfare and politics do man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for\nSt Louis public radio uh and I want to play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristian cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally there a vote both are running for Senate in Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Eris signs are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha has voted to take that protection a way\nThat it's just a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics that they turn on TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Martha mix Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the bucks and I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people who find themselves in how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answers that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash or record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and just enroll everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good at figuring out how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people who have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full\nRange of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition so the problem with what the Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nWe're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop or insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen by\nRepublicans whether it's the house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley floats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will see it on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because\nI think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nThe health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who as well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn tries to explain well goes about explaining\nThe you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to that level that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick examples I've covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly okay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb\nOf one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions and he collars Holly and ask him about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd Holly's giving the answer that I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the foreign will CARE Act this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues [noise] fast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally now these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nPartisan events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Hawley had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him yes okay so So Jonathan Cohn that isn't this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know again because of the complications of healthcare\nUm it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nYou know we'll we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um as as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confused people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say X or y but\nHealthcare is one of the dishes where I think instinctively you ask your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your healthcare which like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats now\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and

party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people want to keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and this is what we have a\nWe even have a Fox News pull in recent Fox News poll from just the within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are ... Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare adapt and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did after the Affordable CARE Act became lied did after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\n[noise]\n\nThe honeybee or a news network is funded by you and make the gun McClelland designers makers and buyers are fine jewelry so that's Eighteen Ninety five purchasing stay diamonds gemstones and heirloom jewelry MC to Jules dot com\nAnd by the Springfield perking us or if he would send facilities downtown and throughout the cultural district details of Springfield ... dot com\n[noise]\nGo up like ... holiday party which he pointed where\nTommy wait till you see it\nWe're going to kick our heels to count\nThe hot [noise] throw back a few cocktails and have the bomb\nThat city years jazz baby holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton you're glad rags on to get your ticket today at NPR does [noise]\n\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from the listeners of W.

in\nA in two thousand Eighteen I'm doing today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering see a healthcare social welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois lands here on the air\nHello yeah I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and dealing with this whole healthcare thing for many many years and I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect\nI could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have gotten a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I have to get a share ministry yeah ministry a type of a contract live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee quickly slates you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nSo I'm kind of you know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there that they still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to ah pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah lynched thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn uh this I think it's this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that the AC didn't cover everyone who needs assistance I'm with health care and so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\n[noise] yeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frequently the people who had the insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial\nThere whereas in your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick he didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill said for a vote care comes and says we're going to change that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it well what happened was in a ... for people who are poor for or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and ah your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who is now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternatives so the question is how to deal with that do go backwards to the way it was do you just take away where do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare and Medicaid\nTo them these are the you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward but\nIs it the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation only here is should repeal replace or or preserve ... it'll be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternative next steps\nBut we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple towards either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side uh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they're all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medic I mean this candidate up in Michigan or this\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield ... Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation that really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally\nThis is the conversation we're going to have leading intimate twenty twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that they will CARE Act\nOr did not solve that the cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act where they say\nPremiums cost per family going to go down twenty five hundred dollars and then\nAlmost doubled since ... co payments they send you unless your doctor now we know that was his ally of the century you wouldn't lose your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it\nWe have one guy to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that\nHe favors the insurance for pre existing conditions exactly the opposite of what he has allowed this to the Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law\nThat is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I can to Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to um point Hi mega so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a a lot about what they're seeing and races that they've followed ... ... is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the\nThe most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just a Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there and Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealth care and and the preexisting condition argument front and center on her campaign to the Democratic superPAC that's backing her\nI a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions in health care and it's it's an issue that Democrats\nClearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have\nHandled the preexisting condition question uh so many of them are now vowing to protect\nA pre existing for pre existing protection preexisting condition protections that they have voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay to wrestle read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... which hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then the similar plant came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "23"}
