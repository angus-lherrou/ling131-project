what's your thought for ... were at one eight hundred forty three to five five to eight hundred for two three talk\nNow ... ... ... in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nWell all the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a coup can now oh talks about how Donald Trump as a superb\nGulf or I mean I I I have to ... chapter and verse in my book of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he's the savior of humanity I mean it's unbelievable this was a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support of about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed itself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have trumped the Kool Aid including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching and soul crushing experience for me to see what's going\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by

here's some of the the flattery\nThat members of the cabinet war heaping upon the president in June to thousands Seventeen I think it was president\nWhat an incredible honor is to leave her health

secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\nA no ... you know many of these people can you explain a they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel the to the president\nIt's it's really a cult in what I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nUh that that Donald Trump as an egomaniac who is also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on\nBut you know that that tape that you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting an on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this was not what should be happening in the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump is king he supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws\nAnd yet he is being treated by those around him as if he were the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this oh Max Boot is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to their country until the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against them he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people but worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better Toulouse reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see\n... but let me see I'm trying to figure out the way we'd ask it but it can't the argument be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles or what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your vote for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho ... who cast their votes for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of a of international elitism gone by

and they pass university graduate schools and the S. and applied laboratories science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nThey those same people surrounding themselves or or ... surrounding the president right now so was it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nThe mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that discredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I write in the Balkans in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way about my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with\nSeventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounce my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back and trying to figure out my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean brush the in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nIn I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nKnow and I think that other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you're going in but it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA an open the way to ... which you know I think is it was a catastrophe for America and the world far worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad he's undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us

report\nWithout much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government there's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know\nTry to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and I had in this race and has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president\nPulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states than agreement that basically all of the countries in the world a agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and or at least that's putting coal miners back to

climate change is not all people in their everyday lives to turn away from it\nThere's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claim to\nSay that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth and less they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't going to happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what a action has been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on the hill particularly Republican leaders [noise]\nWell I don't want an element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and a ... the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of a new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine a Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that as he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nUh and at that time the newly minted

Democrats may be so\nLike I don't like yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point er during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend I ... valley resident Dorothy nickloes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nThe Democratic party so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists\nAnd the ...\nAnd ... until\n... sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with silly paying on their heads and science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're\nAnd that's from one point said field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about how congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting the state's hotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but\nElectric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mobs than simply the people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly as a constitutional right that's hardly seems like mob rule to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools and essay and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nDairy and his rhetoric and\nA often in sight of a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to draw sharp contrast started the for Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexander or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised and hands or being robbed together and the Republican Party about while we can really use this because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left\nAnd you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are anticipating perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting because there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parallel but sounds kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled the left\nA among Democrats a and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries in races\nAnd also tension about how strongly to fight for a you know the political success or earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we don't even do anything if you don't do anything illegal\nBut we're going to be tough and we got to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king's Whitney Young you know almost all gave to us that can be taken way\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain a house\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams say in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end uh but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on and the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country of fate take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or
