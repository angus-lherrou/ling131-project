S. interested at all blows up in their face a so the Trump Administration like you said it does seem to be tried as\nA you know protect the crown prince and and then that Washington Post story you mention a Senator Bob Corker who's the Foreign Relations committee chairman said that uh his\nHis briefing for Tuesday has been cancelled and he's being told that the administration is not sharing anymore intelligence with the Senate for now which is a little bit troubling\nSo where does what does this girl I mean there there's going to be an investigation is going to roll out of the investigation the president has already the centrally argued that he would accept a you know the the argument that this was rogue agents he's talked to the kings are absolutely positively has nothing to do with it\nIs is this are we just watching a kabuki dance that's going to end with essentially a whitewash and the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia being on changed\nI mean I see some parallels in what has happened with Russia and the hacking staff you have from\nContinuing to sort of try to excuse to enroll in Russia's role well many in his administration\nA or a little more forceful and saying that no they believe Russia was involved so you could have this\nSort of talk within the administration of the president's wants president wants to do something and other administration officials want to do something else but I think where you're also going to see a lot of pressure from outside government uh you know the financial community for example is of great concern to the Saudi\nKingdom which wants to attract these foreign investors and not just you know not just banks for example uh businesses that Saudi a NBS has really want to diversify the Saudi economy so there could be a lot of pressure there and they could also put pressure on the government saying like you know you need to do something you need to have a real independent investigation\nGoing to circle back to the subject a little while with our panel but the other other than in other news um we've had\nBasically a hiatus from other reports some discussions about the Mueller investigation over the last few weeks as if it's been on on pause but we have a a new report out from CNN that Miller's been busy although quiet about Paul Manafort's been into the investigators' nine times last for weeks\nWe find out that Michael Cohen\nHas talked with Lou special prosecutor for fifty hours\nCan imagine what you're doing fifty hours to get a sense we're this is this is leading we also had the report that the um the Rosenstein is pressuring motor wrap this up shortly after the midterms he\nGives an interview to the wall Street Journal tonight saying that well as far as he's concerned the investigation is uh is is is proper incorrect so you have a few where this is going now\nA Robert Mueller has been full of surprise he tends to a a drop announcement when we're not expecting Alex he doesn't on Fridays interesting but I think you know sort of what you mentioned it seems like where it's going is this is not there isn't going to be some big announcement it's not going to be wrapped\nBefore the midterm elections are\nThe Justice Department now is very very cognizant of not seeming to get involved are are seeming to tip the election than in any way after the disaster with James call me so I think you'll probably see this delayed a bit although if it's something major you'll have Democrats really upset of why with it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nPart I don't know for how long it doesn't seem that Rod Rosenstein is going anywhere after they're at that initial scare a few weeks ago and Mahler it's continuing to get cooperation from people and I think it's like you said it's just every single little bit quieter now and it's not much of a distraction\nAmanda thanks appreciate it very much well let's bring in our panel joining me in the studio here in New York is Joan Walsh national affairs correspondent\nFor the nation in a CNN contributor an author of what's the matter with white people also in the studio Christina Greer political science professor at Fordham and in Washington D.

Abrams campaign has been saying since the primaries\nAnd lost repeatedly on this idea that you can convince these these former Democrats to be Democrats and she's like well no they're Republican\nYou know but we do have Democrats all over the state they just happen to be black people in rural areas and let's go\nNow Joe and you've been down in Georgia as well\nI had I'd been there a lot and I you know one thing that also needs to be said is that Stacey Abrams did\nFace one lasted ration of that old mindset that we've got to run first of all the guy to run a white candidate and we've got to appeal to white voters\nAre in her primary she had a primary opponent she was put up by a lot of the white power structure\nShe crushed this woman ... wonderful woman Stacey Evans have had a lot of potential still have potential I mean when you say crush she said that ... percent of the Stacey Abrams got Seventy six percent of the vote she ... the white vote she carried a hundred and fifty three\nOut of a hundred and fifty nine county so she kind of proved\nThat she can appeal to white voters as well and the lead them my story that comes out tomorrow or as an interview with a very conservative Trump voter who was voting for Stacey Abrams largely because he thinks Brian Kemp is to put it in his words\nAn idiot and he's very concerned that they're not renovate trumping campaign to extreme for Georgia and that you know Georgia is trying to attract the new ... or Amazon\nOr play you know every every city has going for on Georgia has Coca Cola and dealt a has a good does business climate cares about it\nUh Brian Kemp promises to sign a religious freedom restoration bill Nathan Deal the conservative Republican right now he vetoed that bill because of fears of the business climate so that's another advantage she has is that she didn't draw someone who was trying to moderate to do a real Trump being extremist\nYou really couldn't find a race that better encapsulates the where we're at\nPolitically than this I mean you ... ... there too right yeah I suppose so but just the the the the ... the ... in the person of Ryan cap and the person is Stacey Adams and in their strategy is kept also had no but if he wants was one of the primary uh but he out trumped the Republicans were\nWell earlier today we reached out to a one of the women who is working just for black women in politics her name is Linda car was a political strategist and cofounder of higher heights a nonprofit that supports political growth for black women Linda thanks for calling into WNYC\nSang for having me well tell me about your organization set so higher heights for America is a mess\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and other western most coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nI Believe it was to something like two hundred thousand or maybe with three hundred thousand black voters in Milwaukee could not get the I I by the way never bought that I ... you didn't know\nNobody bought you speaking of you know talking about turnout you know I'm ...

Republican and Democrat or three tribes if you count in independence so what if you were told there were in fact seven tribes but two of them roughly Fifteen Percent of us seemed to control the political dialogue for everybody else\nThat's the finding of a new study of eight thousand Americans that was launched by the nonpartisan organization called more in common\nThey released a fascinating report called hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscape and earlier today I spoke with one of the researchers Daniel Yergin thank you thank you for coming on the show thanks for having ms so\nThe most fascinating part of your study what how you describe the two groups with the most influence tell us about that\nYeah so what we have our two groups that really in total comprise about Fifteen Percent of the American population\nUm on one side you have the progressive activists that eight percent of the population there on the far left hand side on the right hand side you have the devoted conservatives those are also a smaller percentage of the population about six percent\nBut what's interesting is that those two groups despite the fact that they're actually a lot less than you would consider the majority of the American population are making the most noise\nAnd that's really what's contributing to our sense of polarization in America today actually these are the ... the loud mouth at the end of the bar who had right back later say that's it yeah and on social media on Facebook on Twitter all those things said it's got all of their race education economic status\nYeah so both of them are actually in terms of um socioeconomic status they're actually better off than you might expect so um you know I think there are some times this narrative that people in the um\nThe people who voted for Trump or maybe the people who are on the far right side of the spectrum are\nAre more working class but actually those are\nThey're pretty awful and on the right hand side and on the left so you have more they're actually more likely to be white and more\nLikely to make an income more than the average American I'm both of those groups okay so did I did find the terms you're progressive activists what are they really concerned with how do they how do you define them these are people that are concerned with the typical idea of social justice these are people that are\nVery active in the realm of\nUm sexual harassment about racism about immigration about things that are typically concerned um that you might see in um college campuses and this kind of thing where people are very very concerned about\nThe victimization of certain oppressed groups in minority more secular cosmopolitan highly engaged with social media exactly and when their their parents they value independence creativity and curiosity okay who who that that that that actually the really important thing the parenting is very very interesting\nI don't know if you want me to just explain a little bit yeah do you see this fascinating divide in terms of the way that the way the devoted conservative and progressive activists think about what's important when it comes to parenting so on the one side you have progressive activists that are really valuing these things have just curiosity creativity cell phone lines independence\nAnd on the other side you have when you ask people what's important when it comes to parenting you get a whole different set of values obedience the devoted conservative yes exactly the voter conservatives are the ones who are really endorsing the idea of obedience of um of respecting authority\nOf of of good behavior and good manners so it's just a very very different idea of what makes the good life of what makes people good human beings together it's\nAllowing the self to be to be free and to express itself or to ... that rules in authority and structure or the things that make for better and more simple aggressive activists are deeply concerned with equity in fairness devoted conservatives leaving aside parenting what is what are they most concerned about Americans under siege yes exactly so they have the sense of a of a ... of or\nThat American that they use that they used to know is slipping away\nAnd so these are people that are more concerned with the Christian white identity that they feel to be moving away from them they they have a sense of and like you know this is reflected in the fact that ... more than Ninety five percent of them support the idea of of Donald Trump making America great again that expressing his idea of a last America that they're trying to read\nSo here's a hit and he was offering a special\nSale deal on tickets for our jazz baby holiday party on us for an evening advancing health folks out sex and sipping some bubbly are aside car in the ... hotel the happened on Saturday December first few clients with an early bird discount before Wednesday Seventeen\nGrab your tickets any PR that [noise]\nSo this is a group of people ... their traditional liberals passive liberals politically disengaged in moderates those are the four groups that fit in the exhaust the majority and these are characterized by three and really really important um features first of all they're frustrated they are very fed up with a polarization the back and forth that's going on in America second they're flexible\nThey are very there have used their opinions according to issue an issue to issue instead of entering straight down the line\nAnd then finally they're forgotten their voices just aren't heard as much as the people on the extremes and so these are the people when we talk to people so many people are falling in this exhaustive majority people who want to move America forward and have conversations and find common ground\nBut you are able to do that because of the center of the tribalism and polarization and division that's characterizing our discourse right now this is going to be a lot of our listeners may feel like these two camps the you know ... you know right and left the only party sucking up here in the room but but\nWhat you're describing is that most of us actually have a more in common than not I think that's exactly what we found you know so we talked to eight we interviewed eight thousand Americans we conducted dozens of hours of focus groups in interviews\nAnd that's exactly what we see is that people are tired of this idea of caricature and the other side I think the ... that's what often happens is people get this idea especially when we're interacting on social media of what the other side looks like\nAnd it's just not true when you get people in conversation when people are interacting you have an opportunity for them to see the humanity and to hear what the other person is saying and to recognize that those person's values are driving their behavior in a way that is is undermined by good faith idea of what\nAmerica should look like and not necessarily by ignorance by hatred by evil and by bigotry\nSo you say your your your study categorized people in seven different tribes who can you briefly explain the categories and the survey that the the hidden tribes of of America don't get into the weeds and some of that sure in a in a second but what what are the seven ... seven tribe yeah from left to right um the U.S on the left hand side of the progressive activists\nOkay I'm going to tell you basically from from an order of left right ideologically speaking okay we have the progressive activists on the far left traditional liberals on the next ... passive liberals\nBeen politically disengaged moderates traditional conservatives and finally devoted conservative on the far right\nThose are the seven tribes wasn't in between the traditional conservatives and the devoted conservatives\nWhat is really devoted to yes well the ... the difference is more in degree in ... rather than kind um between the traditional conservative and devoted conservatives both of them feel a sense of loss about American culture\nThey do sent they do they are mostly are more likely to be Christian more likely to be white then the other groups um uh but uh what separates them is more just a sense\nLeadership support for America on the line is provided by Emerson Collective additional support has

the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of for main street them all the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd and Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know it's competition was um Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog and the late Nineteen century um but uh this was a way that um\nRural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out on railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was found was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard war in the years and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business that all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these ... customers in rural parts of the ...\nUm I mean I think the uh they started out as a selling watch it so it was just a sort of limited uh from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius wrote them all got on board um\nAnd he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between rich and the poor and but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities and\nThe growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nSarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets in opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicky how are just saying also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many malls in America\nI think in some ways the story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely silver curling agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the pattern in shopping patterns and and making that\nAdaptation so quickly I mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe a within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to the ...\nSo here's your is offering a special\nSylvia lunch

show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions fears and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started my fears when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was military sergeant stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nAnd I would poor over it for hours [laughter]\nUm I think fear has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for the years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school in housewares [laughter]\nI'm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this he was the top housewares manager and the entire country he was very innovative very successful very aggressive he he was a\nBear about knowing the merchandise send me on spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it so that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love this she sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know\nAnd I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about\nI'm an old style manager\nHere I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard but he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy was that his wife had left him\nAnd she had um [noise]\nTaken the parts but not the grill uh-huh and and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and then I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it\nAnd he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wars suit came down to you know get my head on a Potter and John stuck up for me uh-huh\nHe had she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the coffee yeah always right lecture but he stuck up for me\nWe'll

ahead [noise]\n[noise] okay yeah you're on her and I said I'm a I'm a current shares employee [noise] um I'm a service checked vision and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nOr not actually attached to the guy was uh-huh fears is always going to be there as they explained that to us if you think of it this way\nThat's gone full circle here's your brother catalogue company like apple outlook for them to you guys talk very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having spores more and more everywhere\nSo then now that the the digital age is here and the millennials by everything online just about and I'm I'm a father than kids and I and I were jeers over Twenty years yeah you're on a great place to work\nAnd I read and um ... full circle\nSo ... so they can just jump in here for like do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that because the you you say your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah I've had here you know what we're on fears and the factory service or are they in the center for applied to electronic [noise] because we do other I'm\nLike we do um flows Home Depot or rules um fast by we do all the service\nI see the wrong with all\nThe store you know wherever wherever appliance just sold we do the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a blueberry with opinion columnist David he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he's he's the company's coming full circle what do you think\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to\nCall out some bright spots at Sears services would be one and that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on daddy you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with then because uh they had this relationship with you via their services business\nSo there is something to that ... that this idea than coming full circle I think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor it's been saying for years this year is going to shrink to profitability\nAnd that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of profit last okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I ate it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel is probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty present in a pair okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores fears couldn't capitalize on that or was having problems doing\nAnd I think that's why yes this is definitely a story at Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and Sears getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nA best buy stock in your all time high is that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround is taking share from Sears and ...\nDreaming of New England public radio was wounded boy you all energy solar

a teenager in the seventies and I was a you know no pun intended die hard a serious person [noise] um and then when\nI got involved in the communities or Detroit we'll find out that there is actually catalog houses are right down the street from me that were built in the forties that were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on a Saturday Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been\nTen years since I've been in a series store because\nI they just don't cost like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky Howard you're the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself\nUh from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um\nUpstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely homes ah and um it\nIt I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed down I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S that\nHe might possibly be able to identify them is a serious home\nYeah well so they can hurt a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how uh in two thousand Eighteen\nYes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and I mean you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so so why is there seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores in the years among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is sort of taking over our in our thoughts and you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um\nAnd you know the urge you to occupy a space that Wal Mart to um uh uh now does a as the largest retailer in the country a Wal Mart be overtook the ears and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it\nSears needs to be seen in through that longer um trajectory of it Sarah I'm a signal or her early comments that\n... what happened to Sears is not just about the last few years it's about sort of a long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties and it it's it's\nIt is an inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] and that all of those and missteps or\nMight have made a difference you know in the short term\nOf survival of a from like like Sears\nBut I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that sector has been losing out to the big box stores to discuss the for them even a even before them the discounters target and Kmart Wal Mart all all founded in Nineteen sixty two\nThe any PR news

price of their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring\nCosts down but there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen\nAnd we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three\nTalk uh Mike Lee borrow there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask when they need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so the first of all I'm saying here that ah the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand and Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television ads\nAnd ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increase government costs\nSo I'm going to presume that if pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what age age as the saying that it can influence patient choices [noise]\nSo if they if the advertising is that effective\nI I just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nSo I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do is raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising a pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks at Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness that doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one that the the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have added context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nSince when they are I'm faced with situation stressful situations um if you're diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer hepatitis are HIV\nWe don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiate and in fact there are some discounts that are written into law a Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV ad would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's no other discount programs there was a three forty discount program so\nThere are no doubt no doubt that the complexity of the system is better asked uh but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what\nWill work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see I think that overall and moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm the the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons that maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisement um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines are there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses and maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist and senior fellow at the health foundation project hope\nShe was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush also an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential campaign Gail Wilensky welcome to implant ... to be here with you it's great to have you\nAnd also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me ... you have an\nExtended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America or I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in\nPharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive drugs it must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence\nThe behavior according to what something costs the relevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time\nWhen as a drug is being considered and then a relevant question for patients is what will it\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nPatients and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question and what it could cost me and then\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there's some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have a what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll the general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician or that\nIt's important information because there is a lot of variability but it doesn't really help people\nTo have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know well they might just information that's not going to be helpful but\n[noise]\nSee any PR news network is funded by you and by WFCR as partners Amherst New Hampshire Mount Holyoke and Smith colleges and the University of Massachusetts Amherst mhm\nMe not to read\nInviting you to join me on an island hopping adventure as New England public radio is planning a trip to Greece next to me will enjoy twelve days with a special group of any beyond this move as we walk ancient archaeological sites and to an island Weiner [noise] take advantage of an early ... before December\nFor CBS tenant and all the details that N.

Bush\nNo Gilliland ski I Want to ask I Want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous\nA segment and that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who really rely on Medicare and\nAgain I Want to offer some some context you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned she Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and in twenty Fifteen\nFourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks are paying the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars in Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on and on behalf of patients in those other countries so why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is government negotiating prices a governance don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually who does it\nA set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals it's take or leave and here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not\nOr as you choose\nUm there is true in the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries there's a lot has been concerned that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price of a physician's is too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to sensations and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government a set some of the prices to low he would not feel any of the facts and the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was all over the age\nI end up in here and yes you a quick question about that too is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research while patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost we definitely\nDo subsidize research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along having the FDA do everything it can to expedite the availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact what we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThey drew up in price of the dried up to a very comfortable level to the u._k. now that is something or we can control okay can do the other it will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research people have to decide if that's what they want and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mitchell you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know from people like who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow I'm a first of all I had an incurable blood cancer or it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line of drugs so\nThe need for innovation and new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex days are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we cut one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex Caesar who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new driver the measure the research budget event age next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development and then when the drug shows promise their drug companies swoop in and require the intellectual property and then president four hundred\nFive hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return a balance from\nMaximizing profit for the drug companies to\nMaximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust star in the pipeline we can do that as a country\nLikely by was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well I Want it to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year on research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring care you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here on folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the U. S. they want to do their residency if they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between the investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the by a pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generics to market um a patent is so long at the end of the patent life\nI'm two or three new uh medicines come to market and the price drop sometimes as much as Ninety percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "18"}
