I really appreciate market talk do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about for the past ten days or so well\nI'm feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since then the terms or a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh every one is going to be thinking and discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what\nJake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually give 'em\nA really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran or who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well uh it because to promote democratic ideals and to uh\nTo try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also saved to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have order around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... how important we think this is a geopolitical spaces journalistic basis a moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ...

Fernando bizarro how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that teen\nLatino turnout was very very lowest twenty seven percent and twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nFew um has a few research Hispanic trends came out this week with their\nWith numbers on that too you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low of ... talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas a back door probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough um interestingly for instance Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as always he always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um he he never likes to talk in Spanish in public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout was going to be that traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week was there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection on the Latino vote we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hands\nOn on the turnout ah Fernando or they're in a couple of other races that you would point to that in which do you think that's going to be politically important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans and Florida and we tend to think about it I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly and the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case [laughter] there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis on the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic\nYou know the Latino bases well entrenched there they are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than than the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor who Leon Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the midterms because numbers have shown that the rate is at what he said it's not what it

of Latino voters in the idea there's going to be a surge but that there is a even if there is greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually laughed in the middle of this question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know everybody is asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still isn't disaster are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically in the past it's been very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized and they actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I\nYou know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday Morning and say\nYou know and that's what the term question has always been so these questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been probably talking again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... kind of a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... and I'm Andrea I lame on they spoke

political power and social racial and economic justice Kagan will not point\nHi David thank you for having me\nFirst let's start with you a George two minutes from Milwaukee himself so what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin if I go to a school have out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about a code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I went to in the air or not MPs are just pulling lucky because that's where I live but when I started a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame family going from\nBeing around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different things and had different lingo and different things and I have\nSo I remembered my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I Would fail you starting playing and people would not understand what I meant by sanctioning words or I Would get feel different for talking last properly and they did so I kind of get\nStarted teaching myself that when I met or I talk proper proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk how I feel comfortable talking and you dislike that my family and friends I used to you\nKnow there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a star Carter is a ... played by the actor a man's western ... she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights her poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters William since she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is dying and I said well we're\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nThat means slipping a switch in my brain willing since ... if a rapper with they she doesn't\nEven for my friends\nStrain makes them cool thing makes me you know those kids who\nHave faith can\nKay is that what you're talking about yeah gotta get back to what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken um are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburb when I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks and now you have to act is completely different and so because of the areas of where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because\nUm it's like you because you are\nBlack saying these worries and acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happen subconsciously because you'd never wants to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both of my\nMostly white communities and mostly populated with black humid in the way I spoke the way I talk to address the way I act it was completely different side that somebody can relate to the idea of Code Switch team\nWhich are how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around to having to think consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway um I think\nIt's definitely an extra burden that we have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity that we always have to say\nThis now [noise] dimitrius you want to go in there for ... no I'm Sorry okay go ahead ... to\nA library and I [laughter] I um I definitely think that\nIt's way more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always face was having to fight so many negative stereotypes that's already approaching this in the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated they miss their that their head they will never wire and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like\nSo what do I have to conform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think Khaled switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and civil or face all trying to be ourselves but then also\nFace I'm trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe ideal of perfection other people's eyes where we are\nTo be trusted you have a different take on that\nUm I agree on that one Minnesota situations like when I have like a job interview or something oh put on a voice like not to be like a pill like a white voice that's correct but um\n[noise] you get back on the back to me don't\nYou sure of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father of a stark harder in the opening scene\nAbout how important was to be proud of being black and at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls needed to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials do choose to receive a version of the talk like that\nUm you know is a pseudo talk like that when I was younger\nSo how does lay out what was it was as one night we me and my father\nWas like in the kitchen token they were just talking about driving and stuff and we go to the topic\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community

Michael\n... the the the racial profiling and the tension between races I mean look we got we got Donald Trump elected to the attitude and the mentality of\nWhere the state of mine is you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws and check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile is still on the fourth today\nThank you so much for your perspective Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it on thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\nIf he's in her corner but a certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's a respect we need to respect for both both sides um when I was Thirteen I had to experience will stop and frisk and picked me to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fear of what police can you tell me about\n... ... can you tell me a little bit about what that incident was like\nOh it was like what happened it was scary I was walking around my book and I was going to build into building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary\nAnd um they called me around the corner and they started to check my and go to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say well you scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time a ... like Cruz by me I always like shake up yeah\nYeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and a half for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kind of takes away from the human element right like this are you acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nIn the same neighborhood for years so it could start growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or a week like we should start growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and think\nThat that should happen they ship please please offices and the same neighborhood\nAnd there had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has an a you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood majors yes yeah\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old\nWho is a falsely accused of sexual assault or I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and

Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he would there\nAs well how much does this affect your your daily rhythms in your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you look out of your near you see a police officer here and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong\nAnd I'm just to add on listening to the video and the incident with the little boy age very much reminding me of the situation with immaterial\nAnd how that affected him he immaterial had no idea what he had done wrong and not the little boy that it just happened to and\nThey now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something bad is going to happen to him at such a young age and now he's going to grow up and have that carrying around and him so did\nGrowing up black and living up living in this

conversations with the prompt with your classmates that spark any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had to up to one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually dates back a conversation about what happened but it wasn't a I'm\nA growing conversation and it was more so like my teacher talking and then people just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I'm known for talking about activism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the side I um it
