I thought maybe he was going to end by\nWithdrawing because I couldn't figure out how somebody thought that they weren't going to get Republican votes by attacking Democrats so mercilessly and making these wild claims about\nHow this attack was coordinated so I thought that he was giving a withdrawal speech um but in fact he wasn't he was doubling down and you know we're a couple of hours before the vote now yet to see if he succeeded but I guess he felt pretty desperate following um you know what was really compelling\nTestimony from Christine forward\nLet me bring you to your your remarks in the Senate floor specific in March when the Senate floor today you you drew a connection between Cavanaugh a and his stance on the Affordable CARE Act abortion and guns can you talk briefly about each of those areas of so he was\nAnd I I just think this this this guy's a radical on many of those issues you know his his opinion denying an abortion to young immigrant Carl who qualified for that procedure under all existing legal requirements the way that he\nSort of adopts a language of the anti choice movement and using words like abortion inducing drugs and abortion on demand that that all tells you that you know anybody who thinks he's not going to overturn roe versus Wade is just living in a fantasy world is going to do it and he's going to do it as quickly as he can\nI'm On the Affordable CARE Act I just take trumpet his word that he has\nMade this decision not to appoint anybody who isn't going to help him dismantle the law I think that's what Kavanaugh will do\nI guess maybe most worried about him on the second amendment because I spent so much time thinking I'm working on guns he really is more radical and guns and he is on anything else he is likely you know what we sort of call a Second Amendment originalist somebody who doesn't think that Congress can impose any restrictions that weren't contemplated\nIn the text of the original amendment itself and um he he exposed to that\nThat that radical nature on on the second amendment to the committee and and and that sort of where the the sort of judicial rate is moving to go way beyond the Heller decision which says yeah you ... there's a right to individual gun ownership but you can restrict that right within\nYou know the twenties he probably doesn't believe there's any ability to restrict that right and maybe he'll be able to convince a few other justices to move with him\nLet's talk about the current chaos if you will that's now engulfing a judge Kavanaugh's nomination and that is the uh FBI report yesterday you tweeted quote one copy of the FBI report\nNo more than an hour to review at no ability for any follow up than a rush to vote for two years McConnell that senator Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell McConnell has been\nCarefully and purposely breaking the Senate this is the final blow no comedy or tradition left it's just about power politics\n[noise] yeah I I I ... when I'm angry at the time\nI was clearly a pretty pissed last night when I sent that out um but I still believe it I mean\nWhether it's you know getting rid of a filibuster for Supreme Court justices ending the practice of what we call blue slips for appellate court nominees of the the the rights of state senators to objects to people being put on their appellate courts or now\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local company installing roof ground amounts and do all access trackers helping household live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nUm I I really do believe he's breaking the traditions of the center and I don't know that we get it back I Would just say I'm only an hour now from coming out of that\nA briefing on the FBI report it's one of the most humiliating things I've ever been a part of their were you must have been Fifteen Democrats in this room sharing this report with only an hour and only an hour because Republicans were coming in at the end of the our way to clear out of the room\nWe're desperately trading papers trying to read as much of it as we\nCan literally ...

nomination goes down to defeat\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches

there are a lot of Republicans and Mitch McConnell may even be one of them\nWho would rather\nGet a Supreme Court nominees through um even at the cost of possibly making a marginally negative different in some Senate races [noise] I mean there are a lot of Republicans for whom\nGetting conservative Supreme Court justice was a big part of what they are there for the other thing though is\nWe don't actually have a lot of experience about a charged battle over Supreme Court nomination right before a mid term election I mean if you think about it\nThe big fight over Clarence Thomas I'm happened a year before the next election um and it's not even you know I mean there's been a lot of talks incentive at the time about the you're the one but it's actually not clear that it made a huge difference in\nThat election um\nI mean why did you Senator Patty Murray Senator Dianne Feinstein as a result\nOf that and I'm going to be wrong with it but it was the one the one place where\nIn that year that I think you can make a strong case that it made a difference was Carol Moseley Braun winning the Democratic primary over Allen diction in Illinois Dixon having having been towards Thomas but\nFor the rest of it was largely an economy election was not an election where in the fall of Nineteen Ninety two there was actually a lot of talk about the uh the hill and Thomas\nI'm controversy I mean I'm not saying this won't make a huge difference in turn around I'm just saying we don't know we actually we don't have a lot of data on the question of you know so let's say\nKavanaugh gets confirmed as I get some more conventional wisdom right now does the conservative anger some side or can last for another month you know we just you know not just an open question\nBecause you know and I'm Susan Glasser sent out a tweet today that said basically we are close to being back where we were a week ago accept everyone everywhere is angrier and here's what it sounded like the protestors swarmed the Senate Hart office building today\n[noise]\nI mean those are protesters um their partying and they're cheering but they're also angry if Kavanaugh to give the flip side if Kavanaugh is confirmed um\nDoes that anger like Ken that anger be even more inflamed\nOr were Democrats definitely you know but there's there's some ... there so I definitely think the Democrats will be motivated because what many Democrats are witnessing is essentially the fraying of American democracy in the three branches of government you have\nA hyper partisan Supreme Court nominee who traffics in conspiracy theories who's being pushed through by a Republican Senate that has changed the rules to make sure that he gets in and the Democrats have not forgotten about Merrick Garland writer you know\nThat was never in the greatest hits of democratic rights but now it is because they realize that the process\nRight not just the individual but the process the so skewed and then you have an executive who also traffics in conspiracy theories and his hyper I mean he's going to be hyper partisan but he has a very distinct world view that is exclusive an isolationist which is very worrisome to Democrats so\nThat being said we also have to remember though we're pretending like we've resolved as Russia issue is not that Russia has left us alone so\nStreaming of New

from Washington Welcome to America on the line Kevin\nGreat to be here and I wanted to say that in in a few minutes we'll be getting calls from a number of teachers whose campaigns we've been following But Kevin can you give us a bird's eye view of what's been happening on the ground and how this movement started in states like Oklahoma and Arizona especially\nYeah so really this movement started in a pretty grassroots way I'm a lot of these teachers a first got involved through Twitter\nFacebook groups where they were sort of sympathizing with each other about uh the state of their classrooms the state of their schools or their own low rates of pay in many cases\nAnd then sort of grew from there often with the encouragement and you know some prodding from teachers unions a there was really grew out um you saw big large scale teacher walkouts in Oklahoma in Arizona in Colorado in West Virginia in Kentucky\nAnd all of these states basically are red leaning states where\nEducation funding was cut during the recession a been sort of two thousand eight should as a night she doesn't ten and never really recovered after the fact and it's been some really horrible impacts about on education in Oklahoma\nA huge chunk of schools are now only open four days a week in order to save money\nOr an Arizona more than half of the teaching positions in the state or either empty or filled by someone\nWho doesn't technically have the qualifications to filled up uh when I was in Arizona earlier this year I'm looking at how the teacher or both impacting that states governor's race or there were billboards up from a school district in Texas basically promising teachers in the states you know come to Texas and we'll pay you more\nSo this has really been something that's builds and builds and builds the Komen aided in these teacher walkouts that we saw sort of a wave of them throughout the spring\nAnd now a lot of those teachers were that inspired to run for office some of them have already had very big wins a if you look at Kentucky uh for example there are a teacher was able to I was one of the Republican leaders of the state house and a Republican primary were basically the only difference between he and the other Republican running was that he was going to put more money into education\nAnd now we're really seeing them more mostly running as Democrats and really having a shot at winning a lot of districts in traditionally red territory in states like Arizona Kansas and Oklahoma\nAnd have we seen this kind of movement with education in the educators before\nSo there was something similar to this happened in sort of the late eighties early nineties uh there was a big spike there were some teacher walkouts teachers' strikes are some teachers running for office but\nReally it's been quite a long time since we've seen this type of involvement\nUm uh we have Joe beside Shia who

Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about or what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we've got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our Web sites are for example a Don Kathleen as saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town my residence is surrounded by college housing\nThursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical defeat dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students carrying racks of course in the next party\nUntil the cultural privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this is the story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or\nOr even graduate says they reflect back I have to say [noise] um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago\nIf I might say quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on\nA scores and scores of studies the over arching an irrefutable findings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking is significant and sometimes quite ... and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent\nAnd they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old\nAnd those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college\nYoung adults are the same age ... this is the heart of of the problem is when we talk about alcohol abuse and high risk [noise]\nThose levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that\nEven given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nOr to of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent might be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consumed two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched\nOne quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consumed so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious\nProblem can I some significant grew yeah so if it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that well uh sometimes\nToday with the word a binge drinking is used in typically what is the use most commonly and measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise] more recent decades that we have better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four or more in a two hour period because\nThat is sitting sometimes for college students might mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up to a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal limit the in terms of driving when a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas\nAnd that's a so if we're talking about drinking a five or more in a two hour period\nWithout intention in some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of virus drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what his most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think it's interesting\nAbout what that defined may potentially be if we are going to talk of the difference between drinking over in the past decades and that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I'm stuck into my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different at St people seemed shock that there are just handles outside or whatever he needs to get a hold of\nEasily available to basically right off of that year freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be somewhat experiences at their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend\nRe enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] um I think probably a ... D fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking hard alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your\nYou know drinking for um tailgate before football games tended to be more beer gear Hetty whereas party fraternities\nFor you know whatever they tended to be more on hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with brown eyes like if you're going to a tailgate or something and stuff they're going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties in certain things like that a hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carrier carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient than just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay was Perkins\nI mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend\nWell I think it is true that are depending on what the particular contacts you might see more beer being consumed or or more hard liquor [noise]\nBut the the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties uh that were quite common in certain circumstances back in ...\n\n\n\nAnd buy a table and vine flagship store at eleven Nineteen Riverdale street west Springfield offering knowledge on selection of one spirits and beer on line a table and vine dot com\nAnd tune in to hear news talk culture on the NPR News network ... am six forty bad in Franklin County at Ninety One center\nFor a schedule of programs visit any PR dot net\nThere is going\nAny viewer has one more great give away to finish off for a full phone drug user to win tickets to see Bob Dylan in Springfield you could win grief seats for the whole for his concert in November you also get a combinations with the tower square hotel after the concert\nThe Bob Dylan shows on the weight of showing up to enter right no it didn't eat P.

environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nWoman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them to read your to eat and the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it's shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself now insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talk to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what Stevens saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you is it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress 'cause I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to grow with your friends and have a couple of drinks I brought it was saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks [laughter]\nThere's there's not people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight I think it's ... more of like you just it catches up on me but you go to a party and there's like\nThere's all called her and you started drinking drinking and then you walk out but there's a million different ways relieve stress and the button you know it was not a comment one I Would say\nOkay so ... again Stephen ... says ah why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak there are a million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in ... feet which is such a ... century city you go for a runner you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for school or work or other things that are laying down on you\nOr ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and\nSaying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to\nDrink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time\nUm at least not now in law school an undergrad one needy your responsibilities weren't as much as they are earning now I'm like go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that\nBut certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to drive to French that distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my life as blackout is kind of used almost colloquially like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're like as to what the comment on lines and [noise]\nI don't like I don't know that\nWe are all black out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language now in a way that it might not have been before\n[noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the erotic uh\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just from here I already graduated from college and hearing all and

Valls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell and the next few minutes needed Totenberg is where this year and you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you would call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their side but don't\nBe fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he\nHas done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this was true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budget they got you know funding for the federal government true when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer [noise]\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their point man\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still young [noise]\nAh there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a a fifty yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a sexual assaults mushroom trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying\nWe cannot put a U.S Supreme Court you cannot\nElevate someone to the Supreme Court who's been accused of such crime right there have been founded what what\nThey're saying his if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoned from the outset when President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh from the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent\nAnd warning norms of transparency and fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty and Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison in this hearing\nThere were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nInvestigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House our report\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield ... falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven nothing\nCould be further from the truth first they blame us for delay\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't\nWhen it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction with this nomination in reality again using Democrats as a strongman\nBecause what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward or conscience there and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign\nAre they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nFuture Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate's conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to win trench an advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo be the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to him\nScreening of New England public radio is funded by ...

Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nEvery one of us will go on record with\nOne of the most consequential votes you ever cash and the Senate\nNow the stakes are always hot for Supreme Court nomination\nBut colleagues the extraordinary events of recent weeks have raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding\nWhether to elevate a stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not any more out after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say whether the states\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America every one is innocent until proven guilty will\nEither state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside one politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious\nThoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American flight or will declare that our society cannot and must not will not set the bar so low\n\nSo I'm at I'm president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long or on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would\nPave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of far left protestors\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side they weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yet\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit in the evil\nOr you're fighting against it more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy met\nAnd I'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from\nNineteen eighties that was in ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by ...

at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh last night set him straight earlier this week\nI'll stop and consider the snapshot the absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness dish\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution\nThe public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation ... hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination by any means necessary it was right there from the beginning madam president\nA clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote\nWas called\nFor a fair wage their average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for a delay those fell flat there were broach distortion of judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside about Jeffers\nAnd there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... ... women\nHospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old play ball but here's the problem they all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh says twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nOpinions\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character\nSo it was fair amount of president the old tactics weren't working one going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened

and\nMs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and we do see a number of senators that there is that very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nEven before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical thing it was kind of do NPR's ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is

many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to a confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree you would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the culmination for Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime\nReally of campaigning for changed federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killing\nMr Toomey Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote their Scott Detrow Racine that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is in is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote goes until they banged the gas\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or have assumed as they know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice age here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has got to Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin and you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and the ruined is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nOr that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that are Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed\nRepublicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevator screeners are paid professionals only looking only at ... senators look bad no evidence that that is correct\nStreaming of New England

a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin\nThat's right Brett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a Kavanaugh along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of his state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you are going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nAnd he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate that test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us this is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex Conan has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHey Steve could be with him so what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell looks like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term is that the terms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base\nThat frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get on to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap as a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that you know really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have it when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters as ... and that was the challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of\nPower party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up then the people that are at a fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats from Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because
