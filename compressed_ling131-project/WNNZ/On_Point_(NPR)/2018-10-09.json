Anderson is a Republican pollster and author of the selfie vote where millennials are leading America and how Republicans can keep up\nAnd also in Washington is former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton Karen Finney who's currently a senior advisor to the Democratic National Committee and the Stacey Abrams for governor of Georgia campaign\nKristin and Karen welcome to American on the line\nThanks for having us hey Johnathan okay so um how is senator McConnell's um\nThe arising that this is what what turned out turned our uh turned our base up turned are based on fire how's that playing Christian I'll start with you [noise] well\nI think he's right in the sense that for Republican voters\nThe issue of the Supreme Court is something that really unifies the party gets the base energized it's the sort of thing where even when Donald Trump was just the nominee a divisive figure within the Republican Party it was the promise of a more conservative Supreme Court that brought the party together behind him\nSo I think when it comes to the question of has this energize the Republican base I I think the answer is probably yes but of course for every action there is often an equal and opposite reaction and so you know has this made it harder for Republicans in say swing district with lots of\nUh you know college educated female voters for extra fired up this year there there may be some blowback in some places too but I certainly think when he says this is something that has activated and unified Republican voters and it seems to me the data says he's right about that so far\n... what's your view Karen I think it said what we've seen so far and we saw this a little bit ah going into a last week and then sort of the polling coming out of last week that it's motivated Republican men\nAre I think what we're seeing with regard to women again college educated white women who had previously been with the president and with the Republican Party already over the summer we're starting to move toward leaning towards democratic candidates and if you look at some of the data coming out of last week\nIt appears that that has not changed so the climate still favors Democrats but I think what you have seen is and I think it's hard to know how much of this is is a Kavanaugh and how much of this is the fact that it is you know getting closer and closer tightening in or and people are starting to pay more attention\nWhen we're also seeing Republicans are actually become more energized and motivated up more broadly so I think we still you know I think it's such a volatile electorate and I think it's a little bit difficult to\nTease out exactly what's causing which\nOkay so there's a new CNN poll that shows that the President Trump's approval rating among women the way I should say disapproval among women for President Trump is sixty two percent\nAnd this is a an a number that's coming on the heels of polls last week showing a huge gender gap\nUm for the Republican for the Republican Party\nAm I wrong to think that what is happening here between the victory lap in the East Room of the White House earlier earlier this evening\nI'm Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sort of saying that this has all been very good very good for the base that they're trying to trying to make us believe something that actually has been happening\nI think that's I think that's absolutely possible you know I'll tell you Jonathan as you also as you know I also serve on the board of ... pro Choice America\nAnd as you know one of the can we that organization we've been out front a leading the charge against the cabinet nomination and one of the things that we've seen in a number of races is a you know\nScreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from in Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nAnd that is we saw earlier in the summer in some instances in governors' races you had voters saying particularly women voters saying they would want a governor who would protect roe versus Wade if there was a change on the court\nSo one of the things that we've just launched is an initiative to educate people on the possibility that abortion can be criminalized we've also a narrow alleys just also launched\nA million dollar targeted TV and digital advertising campaign in specific races\nSo I think I think you're right in that McConnell is trying to make it so which is that uh you know something we saved if if sometimes where it'll try to say it to make it so but uh I think again I think women are very motivated and they're motivated around understanding what the stakes are in the mix I think in this\nMid term election it feels a lot higher than it has been in previous elections imagery election so\nChristian ... go ahead but I also want to jump off something parents said is is McConnell ... says Karen said he was trying to say it to make it so uh do you agree with that is that how you view it from your vantage point\nI don't think that this is just ... is just spin coming from folks like Mitch McConnell I think they really believe this is\nAnd I agree absolutely with Christian that people are actually looking not wanting to see the bombastic rhetoric and I and there are many candidates that I can think of who are campaigning that way I'm Mr ... maybe you know doing that from the outside but that's different than if you're out there on the trail and say well\nWe're going

Anderson and democratic strategist\nKaren Finney we were talking about a rage uh raised as a result of the Kavanaugh a confirmation process and swearing in the comments from the president\nAt both this morning and just earlier this evening a during this the second swearing in um now justice Kavanaugh\nAnd I want to get more into um women's rage at\nThis point and senator Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or address the issue of whether she was angry about what was happening here's what she said\nAnd I [noise]\nI Am angry when I sit down and shut out [noise]\nShe goes on to say I am angry because of everyone who has lost power\nA junk mail and I'm going to bring in ... I'm Kristin and caring into this the the women's rage the anger of women in around the country over what happened to Dr Christine Blasey Ford in this confirmation process the response of now justice\nBrett Kavanaugh if you listen to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell or even the president the the rage that is being expressed failed and expressed by women is immaterial if not ignored\nMhm well the thing is here you have to understand that\nDonald Trump and the Republican Party has successfully weaponized victimization\nAnd they have made it a commodity to on which to market themselves they said that I'm going to make you feel like you have something to be mad about even if you are in fact part of a privileged class\nAnd if in fact you are see white person in West Virginia or any number of states that have you know\nPoor schools in low paying jobs are no jobs um you were going to give you somebody to blame for that and so\nThat that fact is inextricably from this debate about anger and rage uh you have to we have to understand that\nThere are a lot of folks who have been angry for very very long time and find very good reason to be and it is in the interests of Trump and McConnell to ignore them it's not something that they simply do because maybe they were ... or because they really behind Brett Kavanaugh and they went to see their conservative goals\nStreaming of New England public radio is one of the ball you other western ... offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass

what you just said [noise]\nSo I think that right now and I I don't want to take credit for this insight it was one of the things I saw on Twitter and it actually thought that it was it intelligently phrase but it was that\nRight now you have I think in both parties a feeling of sort of victimization that derives from the really big in balance in power that both sides of the political spectrum have in terms of political intercultural power the idea that that the right\nHas control as Ken mentioned earlier in the shell of the White House Congress now the Supreme Court and yet has very little power and the cultural arenas in the U.S the political conservatives feel like\nI Can't say merry Christmas without coming under fire you know the late I Can't turn on late night comedy without you know feeling like my way of life is under threat I feel like a stranger in my own country similarly for Democrats and they they enjoy I think quite a bit of sort of\nA power in the cultural realm and that where America's moving culturally is quite in line more in line with where they're at and yet that's not reflected in the political reality in the sense that hey we make up this huge portion of America and yet we feel like our voices are being hurt in the political arena\nKaren so it's that imbalance oh sorry it so I was just conceded that imbalance that lead to both parties to feel like\nThey are not that they do not have the voice they deserve\nWell I think there's a couple of things we need to separate out here right on the one hand with women because remember [noise]\nExcuse me I have a cold we've seen women are running for a long before Kavanaugh's before the Supreme Court we saw women running for office at record numbers\nTurning out and making the difference in a special elections in twenty Seventeen and earlier and twenty Eighteen in record numbers particularly black women right so I don't want us to get to a place where we're\n... slating what's happening now in the rage and the anger that women are expressing with something that was already happening which was an expression I think more of women saying okay\nI'm going to put my hat in the ring and I'm going to step up and I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to run for office right I I I don't think the changes that I Believe need to be happening are happening\nWhat I think is is happening now though is this very searing moment and it really you know the meat you moment and now we just you know what we've experienced in the last week it really it crosses race it crosses\nA you know a ... parts of the country it crosses party lines in terms of I mean I cannot tell you how many women that I Know from all kinds of backgrounds who have just been so what we say triggered\nBy you know listening to Dr Ford because too many of us as women myself included have too many experiences that are similar it and it ranges all the way from um you know harassment to assault\nUm and just that feeling of powerlessness\nUm I think it is part of what is now driving a a a rage and an anger that women feel similar to kind of what we saw in Nineteen Ninety two where ... where we were the feeling was hey we need more women in office because we're the ones who are going to bring about the change\nUh that changes that we need it's unfortunate therefore that it was a woman who kind of stabbed us on the back that's another story in the cabinet vote\nSo I I think there are some different things and this is all happening against the backdrop of as we know from the twenty sixteen election a growing cultural anxiety or in this country between you know as the country becomes more diverse um\nAs women continue to rise in the ranks although we still haven't quite gotten there and particularly black women\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches

Kavanaugh's family I mean it it did have the the whole process wasn't handled very well and I think that's initially what upset a lot of people have that in Nineteen Ninety One all over again feeling a literally looking at some of the same faces sitting up there\nA ... and feeling like we haven't changed we haven't learned and yet as women we felt like we've come so far so I think there again as I mentioned before where\nThis is you know there's so many different tensions here and we're trying to have sort of a nuanced conversation in politics which is a hard thing to do\nUm and I hope that uh

book about America begins\nReport who is a Harvard professor and a staff writer for the New Yorker has written a very different kind of American history the book is called the truth and I spoke to her during the peak of a historic drama surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\n... welcome to America on the line\nHey thanks so much for having me\nYou write in your book that the American experiment rests on three political ideas political equality natural rights and sovereignty of the people how's that working out [laughter]\nWell that is a question and one of the arguments I make in the book is that that was an experiment right these truth or self evident and according to the declaration of independence\nBut they are meant to be the subject of continuous inquiry that the\nUnwritten statement of the declaration of independence and nations also found it on the spirit of inquiry so that is actually the question we're supposed to keep asking ourselves how is that working out so that we can make adjustments and so we can reform or revised or amend or\nCommit revolution whatever it is that is required if we believe those choose to be the ones on which a good government should rest\nSo these ... this which I'm In a way it's a bowl title because arguably whether these days we hold any truth to be self evident but you would argue that it's not just the current political and social climate and this is an ongoing struggle in America\nSure I mean it's a long standing struggle in the United states to realize the promise of the nation's founding ideals\nThat broader pissed them a logical crisis like how does anyone know what they know anymore that's not an American thing that has a particular manifestation and our political arrangements since we live in a democracy in which citizens in order to cast reasonable valid ballots have to have sufficient information\nTo make a good decision and whether we can or cannot do that any longer is I think a a big question\nThis history begins with Columbus his voyage and fourteen Ninety two which may seem at first like a history of the Americas but rarely as are beginning point of us history why did you choose Columbus as your starting\nPoint yeah so I'm One of the things I wanted to do and writing this book was try to a cross the divide and that divide\nIn terms of how we understand the American past\nHis between a a very traditional kind of great man theory of American history\nThat in fact traditionally begins in this weird fictitious way with Columbus is if he's an ancestor\nUh and then kind of hops from great man to a great man to great man all the way down to the president mainly up to the present mainly stopping at presidents and I kind of counter tradition which is the sort of social history and history of political movements in of conflict among groups\nA that's a history that more conventionally now would begin with the indigenous peoples of America going back a several centuries if not millennia\nTo chronicle a the people in the Americas from Asia and then would you know proceed in would sort of set Columbus to one side he might injuries that minor character and the whole Serbia sort of about um the the experiences of a different groups in conflict with other groups right\nIdeologically those two very different histories roughly do map on to our political positions right the one is quite conservative telling of the American story and the other is is the progressive or liberal telling of the American story\nStreaming of New England public radio was

when you can't even talk about a common shared passed in any meaningful way so I don't subscribe to like Columbus the great discovered narrative um\nBut I Begin with Thomas because I think for a lot of voters that is that's where they're expecting story to begin and then I pull away from that to ask like how do we how what do we know about\nColumbus and what do we know about the people that he met and how ... how do we understand asymmetry of historical record what does it mean what our obligations to people who lived and died when some people left written records that we need to have survived\nAnd other people's entire cultural history was destroyed willfully are and how do we reckon with that 'cause 'cause all those people\nAnd they're equally ancestors there is no lesser version of who is an ancestor of you know what becomes the United states so I'm trying to kind of mix those things up and actually demand of the reader thinking about why why these two explanations both have a explanatory force\nYou write 'em in the truth is a very compelling um\nParagraph you write a nation born and revolution bull forever struggle against chaos and the nation born in contradiction

simple\nOr their adoptive is essentially historical arguments make America great again is a historical argument it's an arguing about the relationship between the past\nAnd the future rates so was Obama's change you can believe in it is it is an argument about the relationship between the president and the future we have um\nYou know Obama you know famously said in his first inaugural we must choose are better history a there how we can figure ourselves politically is very much in conversation with our past\nAnd I think that's important and that is a a a part of how any people understand

about\nGerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here and the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by Lindy lives our species a multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords and media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court\nA and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino to Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and you know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a Lindsey he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruling a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere was nothing in Pennsylvania Constitution which says and not have to be fair whenever fair me that he just took it upon themselves to say fairness I mean [noise] you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was one analyst called the Democrats dream map\nSo it was that was just such a [noise] it was just to take and unconstitutional taking of power by the for\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ... let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when to Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out\nYes and so the timeline here it was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free and equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats vote and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these um these contingencies of different groups Hannigan map and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the couldn't yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter is that the legislature um came up with it didn't happen didn't have\nFirst of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders did that was never passed by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court and in all fairness to both sides the Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with him ... minutes from the legislature could've come up with a map when when a mid ... and they went back to\nThere's a clause in the constitution known as free unequal yea which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suits\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses out of the firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nEighteen century for the original constitution to find it very yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system\nTo the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because they saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading room on\nLucian well I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in that make up the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into the federal court it could have gone on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge what's going on there was a parallel challenge for off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nAnd that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty somethings seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nNow but the reason why we wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering\nWill we get more moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper polarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and and here's what some voters in ... valley told us about what they see\nFor you for the church and uh\nThere's pumpkin pastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidates Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump giving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign\nOf a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals\nThe Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shaped districts that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nHis old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight point Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterm is\nI like to think of the valley is a microcosm of the United states we Dog Democrats issue Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we've always thought about it [noise]\nRogers calls no Stein a

I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both trying to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre in these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better if gerrymandering because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level\nYou and I just said not the district or the

and we of course of a ... a Republican governor\nAnd a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over and took ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman Mm\nYeah man I made a pain to go ahead who want to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in\nTwo thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats are put in another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law but when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after\nStreaming of New England public radio was for the ball you all energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money and the

bringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that it represents\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do let's that's being non ... you're not partisan but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah so this is not partners in both parties will do\nThat well that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it and there have they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn\nA California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system\nThat does mostly remove

Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just takes he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than\nThey are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation that draws part you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps or their favors in other states like Maryland so [noise] you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair district being planned they call that to take back through Russia will see than they've done it here in Pennsylvania\nThat's about the Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair children's lives are ski he's he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the

that's eight hundred for two three talk a and cruising through just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of the IPC the report\nAnd he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a lot of it\nBut learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more bang to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide ... of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage changed lawns management as well as some normal approaches that sort of at a at least stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems an for bio diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the IPC the report Chris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as ... as he talks about there but\nIt's this it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about what\nHe's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions has to be cut at of extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry\nThe polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it\nA involves planting huge essentially plantations of trees are crops and using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they were burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plant and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze you know that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this has a enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet\nAnd and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to feed the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report we do not need\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you add bay path university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot\nEdu planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires the most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally or be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades [noise]\nThat would generally be restoring abandon lay on marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting the near the aggressive emissions cutting scenario that you're talking about or that you hinted at there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an an issue with that that affects us all so let me just get to them\nA Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question [noise] sorry my question is when the people that are profiting from construction than I Am at oil barons or whatnot and when they held accountable like the conversation but\nI think it's going to make the money on [noise]\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to fund programs or the thing the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking income or something that people make millions of oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell [noise] I I don't know I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change\nIs the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequences of all of us are deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better a driving you know cheating your home cooling your home\nAnd many many other things eating food that comes from very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live and the scale at which we are\nUsing energy is really what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy a ... at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so\n... do pick up on that thought because I mean I think Christmas exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible\nWell ... there is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also\nAn indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations are rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry\nAnd this was a measure that were nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with out even counting for the environmental cost so what's happening in reality is that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures\n\nThe any PR news network is funded by you and by the blue heron restaurant

is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking about the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change is new report\nAbout what the future will hold if we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization all level change humanity's going to have to undergo in order to get a hold on a climate effects or carbons effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he's the lead author of the IPC the report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence because it is up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nTalking about was the global warming and do that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nFifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's reports uh I mean we're two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nAbout what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately while he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both\nParties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIs more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm cold is is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fields just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the PCs report\nA yes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler\nUm in our story actually I'm an wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah you didn't identifies the level but he pointed out um what BP is doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other\nCountries are so they're wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world's coal association or they're saying that because this report quarterly targets colon says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely and what they're saying is actually\nNo we need to create technologies that capture the emissions of coal and buried blow the ground um so that's one of the angles or that is being taken on the report\nI'm yeah I'm seeing here that a State Department official as your reporting ... said that\nQuote governments do not formally endure specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one present during the same time so so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it's it's not in direct us emissions have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\nHigh magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question ... comment on I think making and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best hope of of actually making change so high and it's like a ... campaign like this and\nThat um you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dead on and on the problems that we have in the environment and but it\nYou know it's even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past

Dallas breeze asking could they make a difference they\nCan and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not it for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just some so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at but what we looked at was people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines\nJust going back to what's best for them might so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do what they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land the deforestation that land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport but biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport it's also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars\nAnd less serious charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax on electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available\nLet's go to Kevin who's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello\nHi Kevin what does that how you doing\nJust had a comment to make 'em you know I work in a in an oil industry and um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico for say there's\nTwo thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted to those jackets easily I mean but they naturally infrastructure would happen to be built to you know the power generation would give it to the beach\nBut that that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they dropped it drop all their law if they kept going and the whole time they have to spend money to mitigate another area that needs mitigate needs", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "09"}
