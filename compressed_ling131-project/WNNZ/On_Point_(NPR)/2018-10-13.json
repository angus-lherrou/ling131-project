Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explain that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative\nAnd that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe've seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of heat extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or if ... if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we would back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... how is the government responding to this a panel this to this report\nAh without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government there's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know\nTry to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nA ... and has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states it's an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world a agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of climate change\nUh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and a ... as he says putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\n[noise] uh I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think that I think the biggest driver of climate change is not all people in their everyday lives to turn away from it there's no bigger issue and if this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claimed to say that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to\nStart seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what actions have been taken\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools

element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and uh\nThe un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket where are\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the

assured that he'll listen to the litigants arguments with respect to an open mind well\nHe had to say that didn't he based on his\nLittle Philip in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the grand oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper said either we will go to negative admissions now basically for\nWe will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pull the carbon that's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhat does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need universal health care when they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from the costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization all crisis\nElections sending or is there any sense going back to to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that ah that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabin are what

simply that people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly is a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line and of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself has very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nA often insights a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to draw a sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the

do anything for me being illegal\nBut we're going to be tough and we got to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young you know all those little gave to us that can be taken away\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this as a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on and the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line ... tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year and they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies and there's a debate between that and

follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio my guest this hour Wendy ... of the Brennan Center for justice at\nNYU and Dale ... of the ACLU\nOr you know the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years of late as an activist registering residents devote proponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state and I think it was a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting rate at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appear Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday to discuss the tens of thousands of voter registration applications currently on hold in the state of Georgia she's accused her of Conan blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called the exact match and we've been fighting ... twenty fourteen what happens is is that he had a hyphen in your last name if he'd have a difficult spelling if anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason\nTo not process your registration and that means that of that fifty three thousand Jordan's currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we're deeply worried that fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\n[noise] uh Dale hotel me or what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge no I'd like to hear it\nHandles someone like I'm Brian capital I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering or actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like I'm missing hyphen or the transportation of two letters on a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think is um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote\nIn November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um than regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nOr I'd like to take a call now from awake cross Georgia a John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in to get your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credits at the table that you are saying are being disenfranchised um have that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThank you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nI had to return to discern\nWhat bothers me and it's rarely discuss is the fact that every one of these

undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's about reducing people's rights to vote\nOkay thank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state\nFor the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters had been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nThey'd be great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYou sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to uh to to having voters on the roles\nWell David we each and every eligible US citizen is a resident of Alabama\nTo be registered to vote and have a photo ID\nAnd we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are accommodating whenever that occurs and we visited all six or seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as having our border registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses\nOpen in all six to seven counties and we visit festivals events and activities in our counties throughout the state at different times\nTo make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one\nNow I Would also tell you\nThat in the rare instances where people say hey I Can't get to the red stars office\nBecause my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit locations because it's not convenient or I don't go to the events are festivals in those rare occasions where that has happened David\nWe're going to people's homes and we have given them photo ID in their homes and we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last\nThree years and then much and twenty three days it I've had the privilege to be Alabama secretary of state\nWe've registered one million Ninety five thousand a hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and unparalleled and the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easy to vote and hard to see\nIf you need in that day when you open a bank account if needed that day when you go to the movie if you need an ad they when you buy six pack of beer or if you buy a pack of cigarettes\nThen you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have MS to participate in our Democrat Republican voter\nI'd want to take a really a general I Want to take a call from a nearby state from Louisiana New Orleans I have Sharon on the line ... a share your thoughts on this\nHi thank you for taking my call this man in Louisiana you've had to show and I have an id voter registration um for all the years we've been here which is over twenty\nHowever the the ID now it's changed you have to have a real id to vote and the real ID it requires you to a show a birth certificate a Social Security card and to 'em for a president to document\nUm but they don't tell you you need to find out about the real ID I can tell you go and get your driver's license training so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed but for the next time you vote\nThen you realize you need a real ID and ah you won't be able to do\nSo I think Sharon next electioneering thank you so much for that I appreciate that John Merrill your sucker he stayed in Alabama I realize some of the specifics and interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless in order for\nDavid in this survey to remember that they vary from state to state I mean we have ten\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co

say that you know I I wrote at first but I was Eighteen years old I'm sixty years old but never missed a vote even when I was up in the military I was out of town travelling I think it's a question of taking the extra effort to make sure that my vote is counted\nThank you so much for the call and I can verify that accent is truly from Baltimore or we've also got a call from Alex up from Charleston South Carolina go right ahead\nWhich are having 'em all up and that previous caller's comment on my marriage and gives you every member and I find that it has become very difficult for a service members to register especially last minute on some of the younger servicemen numbers are frustrated because they don't have\n'em they no longer have their own state id they've moved to different stations and received driver's licenses and other states and in their home they do not accept military I eat when registering\nI'm not into that thing that thirty days to receive a ballot and mail it and I think we are getting their ritual service members by not allowing you to be used for a very good Richard stray she's been all fifty states and for creating such a huge gap in allowing him and now\nAlex thank you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate it one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that it really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and there were maybe scores of of of of the allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred but the but the that concern wall talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless such as we've all a test and there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote and these things when ... when the wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he's ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well\nSo I wanted to build up with the last caller talked about the the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem on Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and that really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill windy that's like you know without me but I Will see any way\nThat we have the nation\nIn the last three years and much and twenty three days\nAnd voter registration per capita nobody has been more than we've done\nNobody better than we we don't get when in football I think something needs to know I also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration which is what you're talking about there's different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people\nNow one of the questions that whenever somebody introduces concept to me is it do you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nNow I don't want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whether it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell them is that what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very very excited about that\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's ever been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and\nThat the yield very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things aren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of opposite ends system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates sky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that is to create an opt out says\nSo we're getting callers you're suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid things you take one call a windy day of secretary Merrill's ... what would you think of potentially\nCreating a holiday whether it be a state holiday or even a proposed that perhaps the national level to um have an official day off for voting whether or not they will be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually vote\nOr I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience that people vote when it's important to and if you say well if we hadn't voting on Saturday\nOf what had voting on a day that were specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well when we broken every record the history of the state and the last three major elections we've had the empirical data\nAs Dan said speaks for itself which is that people come when they want a vote yeah secretary\n... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously the risk nipping at turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest when Roy Moore and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race rate of ... and people really turned out but what would make you think that people\nAre ... wouldn't it turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that ah that takes place they could\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go oh Seventy two percent of people that were registered voted\nIt sound like a guy you sound like a guide me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people who can do it right well I mean like that's your desire", "year": "2018",
