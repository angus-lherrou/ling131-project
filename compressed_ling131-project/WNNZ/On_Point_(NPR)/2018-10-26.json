H. eighty nine three immersed in partnership with Amherst College and UMass Amherst it's eight o'clock\n[noise]\nFrom WNYC radio I'm Jonathan Capehart and this is America on the line a news and call in show about the mid term elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country we're here every Monday through Thursday with the latest developments analysis and your calls on the issues that matter the most to you\nAnd with them it turns less than two weeks away we're gonna feel we're going to get field reports from key battleground states tonight\nThere are these are some of the places that will decide who controls power in the next Congress will get to that in a minute but first the latest news developments law enforcement officials now say they believe a number of the pipe bombs mail to critics of President Trump or sent from southern Florida\nThey believe that all ten bombs including the three found today addressed a former vice president Joe Biden and actor Robert De Niro we're all sent through the mail President Trump this morning put much of the blame on the media and sit in a tweet that the quote mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nFormer CIA director John Brennan the recipient of one of the devices responded via Twitter quote clean up your act tried to act presidential\nAnd the president today suggested that to dramatically reduce costs Medicare should pay for some prescription drugs based on the same lower prices other countries pay\nThe White House who's also announced plans to send eight hundred troops to the Mexican border to help block migrants from entering the United states immigration is of course a top campaign issue for the Republicans which brings us to field reports from the political battlegrounds\nUh our regular check in with reporters covering key states joining us now are huff post reporter Jessica show Bergen Los Angeles in Missoula, Montana and Helen Peterson of buzzfeed\nAnd in Saint Paul Minnesota we have Brian backs\nOf you welcome to America on the line\nI just I just kind of start with you simply because you're the farthest west but [laughter] you've got to there are two interesting races in California but I Want to start with the race that involves incumbent ... a representative Devin Nunes\nAnd against the his Democratic opponent the attorney Andrew Janz what's this what's the focal point of this race [noise]\nWell that's interesting because that race is obviously become one of national importance because the ... the head of the house intelligence committee which has the committee that\nIt's supposed to be investigating whether or not president Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to kind of tell the election and ...\nThat is in charge of that committee and as the head of that he's done a lot of things to block investigations stop and accused of colluding with the White House to block that investigation\nUm but back home and Central Valley California voters either don't really know much about what he's up to date with the Russia investigation or they don't believe what they read in mainstream media reports and Andrew Janz prosecutor who's running against him he knows that\n[noise] we had so much for last year we are doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north up and get your glad rigs owners get your tickets today at NPR are done that\nState campaigning on water as she is a Central Valley is I'm gay agricultural they're very dependent on water and Andrew Janz is kind of trying to make the case that doesn't mean that just so busy cooperating with the White House on Russia and other as she is that he has not time to bring water to fight for infrastructure bills that would bring water boxer central California farmers\nAnd it real quickly as Andrew Janz even competitive is this a close race\nIt's close for the Des checked into very very very heavily Republican district I mean that doesn't usually than face significant competition but the poll Shelley Andrew Janz behind by about ten points right now\nAll right Brian and Brian in Minnesota Bloomberg News is reporting that Minnesota is looking more and more like a bellwether for the country particularly in the house races at talk about that\nYeah there are eight congressional districts in Minnesota and four of them are considered true battlegrounds there's a couple that are in open seats were democratic incumbents are leaving those are areas that Donald Trump won two years ago\nAnd one of them is leading to run for governor the other one just step decide to run for lieutenant governor different ticket didn't make it through Republicans have a really strong shot at capturing this seat in northern Minnesota where\nDonald Trump has been you know as the as working class messages really resonated in southern Minnesota the trade tariffs are causing some uh\nTrouble for his party because the ... it's very farm heavy so the Democrats are trying to hold on to that and they might have a shot at that and then there are two suburban seats where Donald Trump is is a focal point a lot of suburban women are cool to Donald Trump don't job actually endorsed one of the Republican incumbents this week in that race\nThat incumbent hadn't been trying to keep his distance from the president's so there's some question as to whether that will really help him or if it will be a more of an anchor around his neck\nOr the Democrats who are running in these races are they making Donald Trump a focal point are they trying to do with Andrew Janz is doing in California and talk about a issues\nThe two Republicans running in these open seats in in kind of a more rural areas they're given a big bear hug did the president they both appeared within the president came to town and both of their district the\nPresident's ah put the political action committee that's associated with the president is spending a lot of money they just put a million dollars in for the last two weeks and one of the congressional races\nAnd in the suburbs there there there was one candidate who's who's appeared on stage with Trump in and said that I I fully support all the actions that the president's taken and then the other one Paulson who's kind of more of a moderate Republican his like I tried to keep his distance from the president and he he's running behind right now\n... let's go to and Helen Peterson in Montana welcome back to this to the show and\nPresident Trump or I mean he's been to Minnesota oh a lot North Dakota a lot but he's been to Montana a lot\nUh he's throwing his full way behind Republican state auditor Matt Rosendale who's running against the incumbent Senator Jon tester why is Montana such a huge priority for the Republican Party\nWell yeah you know like you said he's been here three times since the first time he came was July ...\nAnd I think you know I honestly think that a lot of it has to do with the fact that tester and his role and with the with veterans services the Veterans' Affairs committee and was one of his\n... complaints against ah the president's doctor who had nominated to\nI served as head of the VA and those complaints were not investigated or or concern necessarily but and the doctor did you resent his his application the next day and Trump just sees that as an enormous affront he said afterwards that he thought that test or should resign\nAnd I think he also just doesn't understand how he could win big in Montana you know he won by nearly twenty percent and yet the state elect Democrats like tester and our governor who won the same year that Trump won is also a Democrat\nWe have so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio certain and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday do some refers to the Hutu north open your blood red zone or get your tickets to the city you're done\nAnd what he doesn't get is that Montana is a pretty famously and historically purple state that prides itself on voting crushed ticket you know today there was a\nA quote in a profile of tests are in the Atlantic were tester said you know like I'm a democratic senator and I've never voted straight ticket\nAnd that and to a lot of people I think feels anathema to what a Democrat or Republican would be like how could you vote ... not in your party it's totally old school but there that eat those have person over party really remains here it's it's ... but it still remains enough what ... I started thinking on\nWhy early on in in this shows life we do to you know or a big focus on Montana and the color the folks who called and they made that very clear up Montanans are very independent has nothing to do with the party that has to do with the person I just go let me come back to you in California the other race\nUm that is of interest is the one involving the incumbent congressman Duncan Hunter up against a new a newcomer Democrat twenty nine years old um our company ...\nHunter is under indictment for misusing campaign phones and camping ... as I said is twenty nine years old but he's also a Mexican Palestinian American\nWell you have some of the more moderate Republicans who have come out in support but very few I think that most people don't want to be on\n... in future elections as someone who had gone on the record of supporting what is generally referred to still has a ... right and a lot of the the ... anti proposition to messaging has been this as Obamacare you are bringing socialism to Idaho you know I think like\nThe messaging and Texas and in Florida has been like you're going to turn the stay into another Venezuela and the people are the messaging in Idaho another Venezuela [laughter] yeah\nWell and held Peterson Jessica silver Brian back thank you very much for being on America on the line we have to take a break and when we return a conversation about the state of our nation with one of our country's most thoughtful journalists\nWho happens to be pretty optimistic we'll take your calls here's the question what are you personally optimistic about eight four four seven four or five\nEight to five five you're listening to America on the line [noise]\nCurrent news network is funded by the un Simmons school of library and information science offering master's programs in children's literature at the Rick curl museum information at Simmons dot edu slash\nWe had so much for last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that you can and\nCan't do only to the extent of humans you tell them to use it to those other allies with wires and life\nOn the sixtieth anniversary of Edward R morose famous wires in life in a box speech criticizing American media ... and ray Suarez [noise] discuss the state of the media today seven party in contrast\nAvailable wherever you get your podcasts [noise]\nMaking those sensory\nUm car insurance inviting you to join me on an island hopping adventure asking you England Public radio is planning a trip to Greece next to me\nWill enjoy twelve days with a special group of any the outlets miss as we walk ancient archaeological sites and taught an island Weiner [noise] take advantage of an early but discussed before December first the tenant rally and all the details that an E.

R. dot net [noise]\nIsn't NPR News network from New England Public radio [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm trying to a party and you're listening to America on the line a news show about the mid term elections from WNYC radio in public radio stations across the country\nThis is Ben what are the most turbulent election cycles we've experienced in a long time but we've been here before some of you listening live through the tunnel of Nineteen sixty eight the assassinations of Martin Luther king and Robert Robert F Kennedy and the massive anti war protests and then\nThere was the political turn of Watergate and the question\nIs what lessons did we learn and can we get back\nOn less divided ground here now to talk about where we've banned and where where we are and where we're going is James Fallows national correspondent for the Atlantic and co author with his wife debt Fallows of our town a one hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America\nWelcome James I just want to remind everyone that the question for tonight is what are you personally optimistic to adopt domestic about call us at eight four four seven four or five eight to five five\nSo James have you ever\nIn all your years of political reporting seen a political climate like this\nAnd this you very technically we're down to spend a lot of years of seeing politics in college back in the late Nineteen sixties and so\nI've seen things I haven't seen anything just like this because there's never been anybody just like Donald Trump\nBut there are times in my lifetime when American politics have been I think objectively worse than now in Nineteen sixty six eight we had Martin Luther king and Bobby kennedy be assassinated within the course of a couple of months we had hundreds and hundreds of Americans per week\nDying in Vietnam and you know thousands of Vietnamese when we had dozens of cities will outright uh you know riots and then people being shot a mainly African American people being shot so\nThis is a bad time and national politics is not the only bad time the U.S has had\nNow James discovering that live bombs were center prominent critics of President Trump including two former presidents would seem like an inflection point that we're we're in not only in this election cycle but in the country\nBut is it and can it be when the president of the United states blames the press for this moment that we're in\nSo let me try to be careful and distinctions here on the one hand\nI yield to nobody and thinking that Donald Trump\nIs an aberration in his job\nIs uniquely irresponsible in the way he's summing up the worst impulses in American culture in spirit so I I Will not make\nAny defense whatsoever for what he says about the press what he says about ... relations among the diverse parts of the American fabric or any thing else so that sort of an oddball thing I Will say on this this terrible terrible bomb threat\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by ... Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield and shelter and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnybody in public office is used to dozens of daily threats one kind or another you know this is I'm not minimizing this at all this is horrible Trump in my view is sort of fanning the flames I I Would be weary of thinking that\nAll of America is some in some kind of um [noise] uh you know new civil war because\nSome guy did this you know there have been people doing extreme things before some person did this\n[noise] well let me ask you the uh the question and a different way does the press bear any responsibility for the tone and temper we're living in\nYes just because the press by definition is part of the the temper of any time and I think that that I think the cable news cable TV news in particular has been caught in a\nIn a cycle that is really a ... that they recognize from a distance is a problem but it's hard for them to get out of so long ago back when most of your listeners were children back in the mid nineties I wrote a book called breaking breaking the news and that subtitle was how the media undermine American democracy and his argument was\nThat if the news got into the business of being head to head competition with entertainment that was going to be a sort of destructive cycle because\nEntertainment by definition is always you know more interesting more entertaining and the news is designed to have some kind of bulwark to say we're gonna show you what's important\nAnd make it as interesting as we can but not just the ... called ... and I think that there's been a combination of ... of cable news in general sort of feeding the spectacle\nAnd over the last twenty plus years there's there has been just objectively a right wing um media empire has has made it easier for people to believe things that aren't true so I think the media has been part of a divided ecosystem on national politics are but I'm not\nGoing at all what Donald Trump says in making that point mhm\nWell is is any of this a fixable either in the near term or ever\nUm yes and I think as another former president said it depends what the media of this year [laughter]\nSo so if we're talking about um the fabric of the United states the argument that that my wife Devon I've been making over the last four or five years in the Atlantic in the in her book is essentially that that and just the moment\nWhen national politics really is bitter and really is dysfunctional and really as polarizing you do have the other parts of American Life\nAlmost in reaction finding ways to reconstitute their civic fabric and the last five or six months we've been sort of an open ended book tour in\nRed state America mainly where people say yes rather show you Little Rock Arkansas let us show you Bellingham, Washington let us show you Pensacola, Florida let a show you Muncie, Indiana these places where\nPeople can find a way to stop arguing about the sort of fratricide national politics and\nExperiment with their schools and experiment with um with uh with all sorts of things can I tell you a story about dodge city we have time\nFor us so it goes I I I was going to get to dodge city um after asking you about asking you about your book which is called our towns a hundred thousand mile journey into the heart of America in which you you did this hundred thousand mile journey\nAnd despite the ... the seeming\nFreak out that is happening around the country particularly if you're looking at ... cable news you came away from that trip in even in your comments in this interview right now\nOptimistic about about the country and I do explain why and and incorporate dodge city into your answer yes\nSo first of all have a definition of optimism that I came across recently met probably many people do but it was new to me a ... one poll rumor won the Nobel Prize in economics a week or two ago somebody I've known him like he he distinguished what he called complacent optimism\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you land a western mass coaching

Connecticut and\nYou know I'm Eighteen and I'm Still in high school and so my civic involvement I guess you know they started pre recently but you know so then it may seem really optimistic as even though politics are really chaotic I guess even on a local level but especially in a national level\nUm I've noticed so much involved in it from people in my generation and people my age being motivated to\nOrganize for things they believe and like I had the opportunity to work to organize my school's march for our lives last year and you know I just when I looked at the primaries I saw so many people who are my age and there'd been a lot of voter registration drives and I'm really optimistic about the way that\nMy generation is sort of like you know making sure that we're educated in involved about the issues that are going to affect us and the generations that come after us and that gives me hope show over\nAt Mali let me ask you a question since you are of that generation that we old folks are always talking about the young people young people are not they're not motivated in young people don't vote and the young people don't care how do you feel about that\nOh I feel like sometimes people say things like that to me I say well can you learn in the primaries are you register or you\nCan have you research the candidates and a lot of the time these you know sometimes middle aged people who say things like that to me and my friends they can't say yes to those questions and a lot of us can and so I think that\nYou know I think that people should give us a chance as a demographic and give us a chance and realize that a lot of us are willing to educate ourselves regardless of you know what side we fall\nOn Molly you are part of that that Parkland generation that makes me optimistic about the future of our country thank you so much for calling in to America on the line\nThank you so much for having me let's go to Matt in white ...

I mean the everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right in ... Amazon warehouses are not like that\nUm ... when he mentioned I'm\nWorking in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company\nAnd I'm a true story and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise] anyway but yeah there are there is a lot of dystopian stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well any of them so let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going this way it is out there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nOn and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much\nBut at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and not ... ... ...\nBecause I mean because with knowledge where it could be asset is the worker right ... it's not the workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labors\nStreaming of New England public radio was willing to go you all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nIn order to a massage um profits for that quarter right just cut a workforce they go to church you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question is new to you India is that in trying to shift perspective a little here\nUm for for these tech companies for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that you focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowered them or a ... that that will actually produced longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch\nIn an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention now that are kind of two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing you'll\nStart ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be you know have radical transparency\nWithin your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share the private company um but they share a olive their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nAh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there\nUm and then I also say like a again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone has invested in the success of and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team ah or I should say multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bowls and we plan those together throw it out okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by this time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you

that\nYou know the vast majority of these or asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states um I Do want to point out one news development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same national security rationale\nThat they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban and the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that ban was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court and one option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border\nYou know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if it's someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on and addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the

terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in in like a logic class um you know he he was President Pence made his statement that is arguably factual different based on department of homeland security statistics about\nPeople on terror walks as being prevented from entering the country and then made a completely unfounded link a leap from that to the caravan you know just becomes\nTen terrorists or suspected terrorists or I'm Glad to terrorists or prevented from entering the country um had no obvious a connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nUm and so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry

should be concerned about the ... the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it
