T. L.\nWe always start off with the latest news and the very latest is that President Trump is campaigning in Wisconsin\nIn Wisconsin this evening for a Governor Scott Walker who was in a very tough reelection race and for live book mayor who is challenging democratic senator\nTammy Baldwin and what we're interested to see is whether President Trump includes the kind of language he's employed in his other rallies calling out reporters as quote fake news taunting Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and well you know the rest will see in a while\nAn earlier today in the White House the president called for unity\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nWe have to stress that we don't know who sent these bombs we do know that they were sent to regular targets of some right wing activists in politicians including the president\nSomeone the writer saying it save a left wing ... perpetrator trying to set up a quote false flag situation to make the right look bad so close to the election\nAnd the timing of this does complicate everything what will be the impact of this attempted terror will it have a positive effect ratchet the noise level back to maybe a five instead of where it is now or are we so tribal now that we risk making our divisions worse\nLots of questions so let's look for some answers to gather from some people who know the landscape better than most joining us from Milwaukee Charlie Sykes

American urban radio network all welcome to America on the line April\nI'm welcome your debut or appearance\nOn America on the line and thank you for having such a terrible day\nYes in Charlotte let me so let me ask you start with you by asking has the president started speaking yet he was scheduled to start speaking at seven thirty pm eastern but last I check he had not taken the podium\nNo he he did start speaking a little while ago and he said do we will find those responsible we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly\nAnd then he said political violence as an attack on our democracy itself so he followed up the rhetoric we heard from the White House but obviously a couple of scripted remarks are really don't change the political context of the moment we're in the\nKnow in April of someone who sits in the White House press briefing room whose band that to to rally is like the one that the president is speaking to right\nNow I I Would love to get your your um observations your reactions of what that experience is like as a reporter\nJonathan rallies are generally um interesting to watch\nUh the rise and fall of the enthusiasm on the continual wise or what have you it it's almost like I'm going to church\nWhere you have the person there who feel the crowd cheered when they're supposed to and and fall down with his coach and listen and cheer when they are supposed to these rallies or something totally different and and just to correct the record I have never been to a Trump rally and I am is not safe for me to attend a Trump rally at this point\nBecause I Am\nConsidered a target um by some of those who follow the president\nUm and and had my own death threat but what I Will tell you is is that this president I'm In his speech I heard a little bit out before it jumped on the line with you he um he has to continue what you said this morning\nAnd it's happening to the question is can you change the tone of what he's already started and tend to believe ability quotient of this because\nAs I watch today and I'm sure you picked up on it as well with your king inside\nWe watched the president's head and and then his his staff jumped up right away\nBut it took a while for the rest of the room to follow suit and give a standing ovation and when you talk so vehemently and and and the hate fully towards groups people be it the Democrats who are my beat reporters who are um\nUh on American or or opposition party or in these are the people and whatever and talking about you know body slamming a reporter and congratulated met and then changing your speak it\nHas to be persuasive not just today he's got to sustain that because this is so dangerous now in a dangerous period he's calling for unity he's got to continue now the question is will his supporters believe him you know and right and he and it's something that the change has got to count\nMy Jones you um and I apologize April for a mistake that you'd been to Trump rallies with Joan has been to Trump rallies and Joan at also as journalists who um give your observations of what it's like to be a journalist that a Trump rally\nI haven't been since twenty sixteen but that was scary it's scary enough Jonathan I mean you were in a little pen and they're you know all his supporters were around you and people would chance a CNN sucks I was with MSNBC at the time but I

because he is who he is I don't want to lower the bar for what we should expect what blew me away today\nAnd I'm Sorry it's still blows me away that he did not mention\nGeorge Soros for Iraq and Michelle Obama bill and Hillary Clinton Eric Holder Maxine Waters CNN John Brennan\nThat he never\nExpressed any condolence condones this is too strong because they're all with us but he never expressed any sense of sympathy\nFor them or their families or the or the people who work for them or the secret service people who work for them and protected them it it's just all happening in some other realm for him and another president would have to say at least\nSome of the name of the people who have been threatening can I just I Want to address\nOr an ... an elephant in the room and we've got we have to talk about this when we you know sort of mentioned it in the intro and we've been dancing around it but\nThan we're seeing it and do we say when when to stop and think it's got to know he got he may not like CNN because we report things we don't shake the fact well he gets all sides of the story and and how what's going on he\nSaid it's blue and we see aren't going to call it on to verify it and that's what we're fake and and now we're targeting ... it's not okay it is not OK that all\nMy prayer he uses that things will change the fact that we continue in the White House for a

Senate race which isn't particularly competitive also has two female candidates who are starting to see more and more a woman dressed as women Senate races which were extremely uncommon obviously for a much of the twentieth century now\nThe gaps in the polls between the two of them has widened recently with five thirty eight giving cinema as sixty three percent chance of winning so what do you think is cinema pulling away or is this still a tight race\nThis is still a very tight race cinema is probably a slight favorite um she has a lead in some polls are the political environment also favors are slightly a but it's not a huge margin in this race it would not shocked me at all if Nick Sally pulled us out\nHuh and so the other thing the other historic thing here in this race is that if Crist in cinema wins or she is she's the first openly bisexual she would be the first openly bisexual\nI'm senator from Arizona from anywhere in the country and she would be only the second openly algae Beatty senator in the country of course after senator\nTammy Baldwin from Wisconsin how our next Sally and send them a\nUm framing gender in their in their campaigns is one running towards it and the other one running away from it\nIt's interesting it really doesn't come up that much considering that this is a contest printing two women against each other\nUm there is a gender gap in public polling that favors cinema uh you would expect that typically I'm female voters favor Democrats or that situation doesn't necessarily change when both\nCandidates are female and actually in some cases when both candidates are female the gender gap actually gets bigger in favor of Democrats or we haven't quite seen that here\nBut neither candidate is necessarily running on you know elect me and I'll be the first woman in part because they are both women although both candidates do I'm sort of emphasize I'm sort of some of the historic nature of their candidacies are of their lives\nUm mix Sally we'll talk frequently about how she was the first woman in the U.S military to fly during combat um after the prohibition are women flying in combat was lifted in the early nineties she flew\n'em in Desert Storm and after a and then sort of the Afghanistan conflict\nFight following the September eleventh attacks\nCinema I'm also isn't really want to play up her gender um but she is clearly you know she emphasizes parts of her background as an algae beauty person she played a large role in defeating two propositions that would've banned same sex marriage\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nAnd but she doesn't really play up the fact that she would be the first uh openly bisexual senator doesn't really talk about the fact that she would be a one of only two uh openly algae beauty members of members of the Senate and neither does make Sally it's really a and this may be a former progress it's really not an issue at all\nNow when you were on the show a little while back into the whole segment talking about the importance of of education as an issue there in Arizona but apparently a health care is a dominant issue in in Arizona isn't it\nYeah and it's really become the dominant issue in the Senate race I was just at\nAn event cinema was actually holding with a group of teachers it was a a canvas kick off to basically encourage the teachers you know go out and knock on doors for her campaigns and the vice president of the Arizona Education Association the teachers the major teachers' union here\nWas there and even she said that health care was sort of the dominant in in the race more so than education it's really become the dominant issue because Sinema like so many other Democrats around the country\nHas just been hammering mix Sally over a Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare and what that would have done if they had been successful to the protections for people with preexisting conditions\nIn the Obamacare law we've also seen mix Sally this morning a came up with an ad where she claims that she would have that she would protect people with preexisting conditions and they've been fighting the insurance companies\nThat is not really backed up by her votes on Obamacare repeal a experts and industry groups and advocacy groups all agree that the protections for people in pre with preexisting conditions\nIn the GOP plan to replace Obamacare would have been much much weaker than the ones that are included in the Obamacare law\nNow ... is a congresswoman cinema hammering congresswoman mix Sally over the report where mix Sally was quoted as saying ... excuse me at a Republican caucus lunch they report I read said she stood up and said quote let's get this ... thing done\nAbout about the repeal effort it's on the part of the Republican Party\nYeah I mean that specifically hasn't come up with that did show you know mix was all in on these proposals a there was not a lot of hesitancy on her part the way there was some other um\nRepublicans running in swing district and a lot of Republicans running in spring districts that he's a number of them ended up not voting for the law\nA mix Sally at that time had an yet declared her candidacy for Senate at the time a Senator Jeff flake we're still expected to run for reelection but she is she was represented a swing district in Congress or ... a district that narrowly voted for Hillary Clinton and she was still very enthusiastic about repeal at the time\nWhy asked folks to call if they if health care was the main issue for them in this election I have folks call aid for for seven four or five eight to

N. F. treaty\nWith Russia China was and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those Russia's doing it and if China's going as we're hearing the agreement accepted\nSo president Donald Trump they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China and the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met Russian President Vladimir ... and both said there's just one point on wished Russia and the U.S agreed\nThat other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world aren't restricted by the INS it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral ballistic missile related treaty in a multi polar world I think on this latter point of the more complicated\nGlobal a strategic environments for something that concerns the Russians a very substantial and we talked about\n... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton safe\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in the world of power and might up\nA world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states he wants to world where there are no restraints whatsoever on US military for freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to have to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world and just you you take down this treaty which used working which is in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nUh the the us and Soviet arsons are rushing arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take and that will bent toppled that seems to be his goal and then you put at risk the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world that is a road instability and war\nI mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal\nUm the ... for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's and and it talks about these exact risk that that uh\nYou know of Russia or China of a non uh a non a bilateral

twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north up and get your glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR are done that\nThe United states must do the same thing so I'm just wondering earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though you say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand that how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons is in play the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the the Russians who have modified and existing weapon to give a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites and European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we've been detecting this was about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently in arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't it repealed the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing ... to do whatever he wants now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the during the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it of course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that wants to them ... no European ally wants them to what you're seeing how of complaint from France from\nFrom Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security no one needs a new arms race does the foreign minister of the European Union\nAmong among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is citing an arms race that was already brewing as both the U.S and Russia building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe but once again be the battle ground\nFor these two nuclear giants as they battle right\nI mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end to the INS treaty I mean I'm thinking of the stigma Gabriel who just stepped down in March of German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall it a ... at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the

Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a trainee buying and a logic to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons it's just going to make the safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing the number is going to make the world and they say are we have enough to destroy the world many times over already it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Ellen ... how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to um ... and if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be\nFrom with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt but that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies with regard to Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that\nJust sort of a new turn back to here because of course uh we we can also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the I N F here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were that the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to\nDeploy strategic weaponry in in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier because of this and that that's putting us tease Calvin term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who want new nuclear weapons in the language they use to John Bolton says you know an outmoded treaty violence\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nFeeling that we're be where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us or as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons that is about ... ah several hundred times more weapons than you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into this trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this was some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China\nWhat they're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a a air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now\nThey they they have a nuclear weapons are up about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to our seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like career like won\nA and like the United states and about forty that can reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those ... we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missiles are hungry to them just\nAre based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines of proud of the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can hit them for every one that they have they can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underline reality to this\n... does nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for the U.S to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match a weapon\nWell everyone focus a ...

growing number of cases of acute slash said my light is a condition that the Centers for Disease Control says is affecting at least one hundred and fifty five patients in twenty two states\nIt's rare but serious disease affects the nervous system and it causes aren't entirely no\nWell you can join us because we're speaking with it will be speaking in a moment a doctor who's been treating patients with acute flash said to my lettuce and we want to know what your questions are about this disease have you seen it sick children in your community where one eight hundred for two three eighty five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime they don't play radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook\nAnd on point radio and joining us now from Dallas texas is Dr Benjamin green birds he's a professor in the department of neurology and new therapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern medical center he's also an expert in treating rare on immune disorders of the central nervous system\nAnd he's already treated eight patients with acute flash it in my ... my latest this year ... welcome to implant\nThank you might not happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou are correct and the the facts are also lead to our part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute ... is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults\nAre there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen\nEvery other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with this type of a condition of ...\nAnd the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that's an intro virus\nIt is that's that suspicion or the enter a viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an honor of ours and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms or in some children who are being infected with this and you say that um we started started seeing a spike beginning in in two thousand fourteen so\nUh but to enter the virus wasn't wasn't leading to the same symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognized\nAnd that the symptoms\nOf syndrome a looks a centrally like polio ... which was described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add all energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOrtiz before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... are accused ... which look almost identical a with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think uh there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand twelve two thousand four team\nInto that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nWhere we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these ah\nOutbreaks in the late summer early fall and what's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention um which is within the family of inner viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus\nIn any of these cases when testing has been done\nIn a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nWhere medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I heard earlier that\nThe viruses are also very common and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but it but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccines for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay um are we are just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path of developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation\nSo that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine we're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for in a show where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials\nThat we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome a ... test negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for but it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um\nWhen we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating in their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus or to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so if you have a child with paralysis and you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "25"}
