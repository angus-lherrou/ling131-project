elections from WNYC and public radio stations around the country I'm Jamie Floyd filling in for Jonathan Capehart\nEvery Monday through Thursday nights where here with the latest political news analysis and your calls as always we begin with the day's top political news we have more now that the FBI report on the allegations against judge Brett Kavanaugh will be given to the Senate tomorrow\nAnd according to Senate Democratic wick whip Dick Durbin only one copy of the report is being delivered and each party will have to take turns viewing it\nIn one hour increment alternating between the parties this means it could take days if all one hundred senators want to see it\nListeners here's our question for you tonight how do you feel about this whole process are you satisfied that the FBI investigation will answer your remaining questions about judge Kavanaugh\nOr do you not have any questions at this point or are you just sick and tired of the whole thing\nCall us up eight four four seven four or five talk aid for for seven four five eight to five five and joining us now from Washington is New York times congressional reporter Sheryl gay stole burnt Cheryl I Can't\nThink of any body better to speak with tonight then you let's start by reading a tweet tonight from Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy a Democrat and get your reaction and Cheryl let me first say thank you so much for being with us so I'm happy to be here\nAll right so here's what Chris Murphy tweeted out less than an hour ago quote\nOne copy of the FBI report\nNo more than an hour or two of us know ability for any follow up center rushed to vote for two years and McConnell has been carefully and purposefully breaking the Senate this is the final blow no comedy or tradition laugh it's just about\nPower politics end quote and tweet so\nSheryl why don't we know about this strange planned to view the FBI report in these hour long increments\n[noise] well I think we know that Mitch McConnell is really um determined to get the votes on this week on Brett Kavanaugh thought Democrats are really angry as few hurt no choice when Senator Murphy they remember well\nAlong the way that interminable delay that McConnell imposed on the Senate\nFlynn Merrick Garland was nominated by President Obama and they were men serious about that um but Senator McConnell has said repeatedly that the Senate will vote this week we know that the um report are actually going to be a\nCollection of reports will be a stack of what's known as three oh two fellows are documents reflecting interview notes from\nStreaming of New England public radio is one of the un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nWeeks later tonight but nobody is going to get to view them until tomorrow morning\nRight and two of those witnesses do not include as far as our reporting reveals a the principals here but they did testify in front of the Senate under oath ah\nBrett Kavanaugh and uh and and Dr Blass the Ford or do you think this is going to be enough to satisfy key senators like Jeff Flake and the other two Republican Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the ones who insisted on this report before a full Senate vote\nWell we'll have to say what the what the results are I think that the FBI\nAnd the Republicans can probably make a pretty decent case that Dr block they forward and Brett Kavanaugh gave testimony over long a day\nAnd the and the Senate and so it was more important to share from these other witnesses potentially cooperating witnesses by then it was from them since they're abused or well known nonetheless Democrats\nAre already laying the groundwork to make an argument that this was a sham investigation that the two of them the two principal should've been interviewed whether that will sway the three Republicans I'm I don't know as we know Jeff\nFlake said ah last friday that he was inclined to vote he was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nThan he had this encounter with female protestors in an elevator he heard their cries he felt the country was being ripped apart and so he kind of did an about face and ask for this FBI investigation but I think barring anything really surprising I Would think at least Jeff\nFlake will be voting for Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd as you say he encountered those two women in the elevator in addition to that there has been considerable negative reaction to President Trump's mocking of Dr lousy Ford Brett Kavanaugh's accuser last night at a political rally in Mississippi\nI had one [noise] right I don't\nUsually goes you know there was one of ... how did you get home I don't remember how did

supporters in the crowd cheering him on bought those critical Republican senators on Capitol Hill did not seem please today hears Maine's Susan Collins\nAre you comfortable the president's attacks on Christians lobby board or your brother the budget cuts the president's comments word just plain wrong\nAnd Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski\nIs president yesterday\n...

O U [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm dreaming void and you're listening to America on the line alive at news and call in show from\nWNYC and public radio stations across the nation\nWe turn now to a story that on any other day would be leading this broadcast\nThe New York times dropped a bombshell report late yesterday on line and on its front page today that concludes based on one hundred thousand to documents and some interviews to that President Trump's father gave his son Donald Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over the years\nNow Trump is portrayed himself as a self made billionaire with a knack for the real estate market who received only a small loan of one million dollars from his father to start off the times story attacks that notion\nAnd almost as newsworthy the White House response makes very little attempt to challenge it\nJoining us now to discuss this unfolding story is WNYC Andrea Bernstein is she is senior editor for politics and policy curate WNYC and she's the co host of the podcast Trump ink which is produced in partnership with ProPublica Andrea hey\nHey Jamie so I Know you have now had a day or so to pour over this vast I guess Fifteen thousand were coal\nAh it's a pretty detailed and eat impart alleges that President Trump avoided paying taxes on properties acquired from his father that's just part of it right\nThat is just part of it and by the New York times estimates his family paid a about a tenth of the taxes that they should have paid or if they had declared the true value of their properties\n... what was your reaction when you saw this I mean so many documents tax returns receipts it was pretty unparalleled\nYeah I mean it's obviously a formidable effort by the New York times journalist who read through all these documents and it and it feels that a lot of the sort of holes in the history I mean there are a lot of terrific biographers of Donald Trump who have documented over the years how\nA Donald Trump has gotten money from his father I mean there is the story that is a repeated in his New York times story that's widely known about when Donald Trump's casinos in Atlantic City were failing his father sent an ... an emissary to buy three million dollars over three million dollars in casino\nChips which were then never used which was\nIn essence a three million dollar loan so there's been a a stories about this but the bread and the debt than I think most striking for me with the\nDetail in which the sort of having it both ways of the uh Trump family airs both claiming their properties will work very little and then for example when they were going to be taxed on them but then claiming\nScreaming of New England public radio was funded by you on small ones from certified naturally grown fruit ferment averaged with a farm standard for sixteen but road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones from dot com\nA stunning of confident uh and and rather massive a conclusion\nBy the New York times I mean the first sentence just comes right out and accuses the president a quote outright fraud is the is the sentence a vet starts off this massive report we can't go through all of it but uh what really stood out to you Andrea\n[noise] well I think what is interesting about all of this ... the volume of obviously the\nThe two hundred Ninety five revenue stream or the way that there were just all kinds of ways of creating money flows to Donald Trump and his siblings in many ways that they could evade or as a New York times says defraud tax authorities so that\nReally stood out but in in\nCovering Trump's businesses as we've done for the past couple of years on the Trump ink pod cast we have heard\nClaims over and over again a consistent pattern of outright lied defrauding buyer there've been hundreds if not actually thousands of civil suits against\nDonald Trump and updated his children in some cases hits business for lying to buyers for example in condo projects so the\nThe it does it is striking to me the similarity between what the New York times document here and what the Trump family has been accused of and the businesses have been accused of over the years right it\nDovetails a entirely with other report Hodge including\nYours that Trump and came right back to the amazing claim that baby Trump Baby Donald Trump was getting two hundred thousand dollars per year I as an infant let let's bring in Lauren leader she's the co founder and CEO of all in together it's a nonpartisan woman's organization\nA dedicated to civic engagement amongst\nWomen Lauren uh I Know you've worked on a ...\nAh with with ah with tissue James on issues related to tax the ending engagement for the New York state tax department which is reportedly looking into the New York times investigation I think\nA statute of limitations will have run\nA with regard to most of the claims in the times the so I'm going to acknowledge to both of you that I Am still winding my way to wending I guess is the proper grammatical words or through the Fifteen thousand words are in the times these I and many of the documents\nBut um do you think ah Lauren that this matters in the end I mean we have people on the left\nOut with their heels again and people on the right or looking at the New York times with the I won't use the phrase Trump President Trump uses but they have a their land their political lens or we own our separate chambers Yellen ... yelling at each other out with the facts we believe to be true\nWell thanks for having me first I just have to correct one thing I have not ... I'm Sorry I don't want to confuse anyone speaking at a women in financial services event that on together is hosting and New York in a couple of weeks and so I'll be really interested to hear\nWhat she has to say about it so just to correct that out of the gate but I Will say this I think that part of what is so complicated about this drip drip drip and then in this case was sort of avalanche of reporting on\nFraud and implications of wrongdoing and add that on top of the constantly growing daily barrage of a controversial issues that surround this White House\nIt's an incredibly difficult uh amount of information for average voters to sort through and I think what I worry about is that in\nDespite the surge of civic engagement certainly that we're seeing among women on the left which I think is a unquestionable there is a record numbers of women running record numbers of women protesting calling their members of Congress are reaching out volunteer\nStreaming of New England public radio is Rhonda ... offering personal and professional gross through its remember coaches coaches profiles available at western routes coaches dot com\nAnd I I think the Kavanaugh I my concern for the Republican Party as someone who believes in a strong two party system and runs a bipartisan or organization and my concern for them is that they may very well win this battle\nBut on the long run I think Republicans are going to lose the war with women um they are losing them in record numbers the demographics are not on their side and they can't afford to All right I Want to say thanks\nTo both Andrea and Lorena supposed thanks to use so much for being here we do have to take a quick break when we come back we're going to go deep into the heart of Texas to check out one of the most closely watched campaigns and the entire country statement [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\nMm tune into your news talk culture on the NPR News network I Am six forty head in Franklin County at Ninety One seven\nThem for a schedule of programs visit any PR dot net\nStay informed of the latest international news with expert analysis commentary features and interviews on issues of the day from the b._b._c.

where the G O P is in an unexpected fight\nIn the Senate and beyond and I knew it says an online poll it has begun O'Rourke a three points ahead of Republican Senator Ted Cruz and the contest for

also covers immigration and lots more for the Huffington Post hurricane thank you so much for joining America on the line tonight\nDuring my blizzard of thanks for having me [noise]\nWell we have a call out for our listeners asking our listeners that if you are voting in Texas in the midterms please call us up we'd love to hear from you rotate myself aid for for seven four or five eight to five five we have heard for years that Texas\nIs on the verge of turning from deep red to blue or at least perhaps located to purple thanks to changing demographics in your state might this be the year let's start with the Senate race between Ted Cruz and challenger that to Iraq and\nWe're here to support the second amendment [noise]\n\nAnd what they want to judge you never supported it would actually you might not\nSound in the Senate work but it's your job in the Senate to decide if you're going to support or not support forgiven or sorry not not not in the door so when I was nothing to do what we learn how to mind gentlemen\nLet's move on hair [noise] All right let's [laughter]\nLet's move farmer okay you're certainly have an a heck of a race race out there in Texas that was a clip from the congressional debate in Dallas a few weeks ago senatorial debate we should say\nAnd it really has been heated we said that that show has finally been ahead and at least one poll but generally how the race has been going how's he been polling is is it really a chance he's gonna win it\nWhere the polling sort of all over the place I mean you have that one poll that showing 'em up or what is it two or three points then you also have the\nWas botched the pronunciation with the Quinnipiac poll putting cruise up nine points\nUm and I think look to the bottom line here uh you know\nPolling I think can lead to a lot of sort of hold the prediction and you're right but it's definitely right but it's definitely true that it's a lot closer than anyone had any reason to expect a certainly a year ago or even a few months ago I mean I think one of the things that ...\nHas really done is to drive so much energy behind progressive in Texas and really mobilized that base for the Democrats in a way that kind of giving to party a little bit more confidence in a way that they haven't show\nUm I mean I think it's really telling if you look at that race and how competitive he's made it but then if you look elsewhere\nYou know you don't really see a lot of the more prominent democratic members of the establishment throwing their hats into the statewide races this time around the roads actually kind of unique\nFor really trying to take that chance and move the needle so I think whether or not a ... wins this race but I think she's doing a lot for the Democratic party in Texas and for the party's future you know I mean there for him to win\nWould be a pretty massive achievement given how badly the party has done here in ...\nBut for him to lose well\nUh I think is also really closing the gap I mean we have to remember that Wendy Davis also governor's race and twenty fourteen but like a twenty points spread\nRight tried and as you suggest he's he's polling well but he's big challenge a is voter turnout you've reported quote white non Hispanics make up just\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from an average to the farm standard for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nAllegedly blew California but Latinos have historically low voter turnout rate so so why is that ... and how much of an impact is it going to have on the race in the ant\nWhether it's huge I mean if if but or wants to win is going to have to win by driving up Hispanic turnout than by winning a larger share of those Hispanics who do turn out if if the demographics look the way they did last a mid term election\nUh she's not going to win like it's a the math and very obvious but the issue here right is that Texas has some issues with the Latino vote that I think are very important for the public outside the state\nTo understand uh you know people how to sort of tendency to look at the low levels of Latino voter turnout across the nation even and to sort of scratch their heads and\nSay you know why why are these\nFolks not exercising their civic duty when there's someone like Trump in office who's making very aggressive comments against immigrants or Mexicans broadly that many people in the Latino community do feel are offensive or threatening\nBut you know it takes a certain sense of entitlement and I say this in the in the best possible sense of that\nWord right to say that if something uh you know if the political leaders are being aggressive against you that your response is going to be to go out and participate in public life and get yourself with the city council and start changing these things right I think for people that are alienated from civic process\nFor people that may come from recent immigrant backgrounds are have mixed status families\nIf you are not involved in the civic process\nUh having someone speak so\nNegatively or with such hostility towards your community might simply real from\nYour in your your it's sort of decision to kind of stay kind of keep your head down you know you hear this over and over again when you're talking particularly to a young folks right that they get that message a law and their parents\nAre right and ... get ahead go ahead and what about gerrymandering and and and and voter suppression and voter id requirements the things we do hear about here in other states and these heavy taxes\nThose are certainly an issue gerrymandering you've also had historically and some\nAre a part of taxes you know at large mon a district that the lord of the Hispanic vote that had to be challenged in the courts or the state voter id requirement which I'm certainly can deliver the fan and quote\nBut then

Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us at the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean\nOh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago I was like oh this is how I I was like we hung out together and say yeah I Know it was really fun Aslam\nAnd I think I mean as but even though there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic Lee healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage\nOf fat people with metabolic healthy obesity and some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know for team I feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter\nThat we know how difficult wages to lose and we knew how harmful it is to shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important you know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex that's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in his way that hello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that\nI mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them\nAnd that's something that with primary care providers a lot of patients just never get that luxury if somebody\nAsking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nWell a lot of patients period will never get that luxury with their primary care physician is doctors to ever go ahead yeah so\nAm I Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity I'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes weight by and stigma so I Want us to\nTo make sure that we don't do that now this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity is such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define clearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOut of favor because what we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity morbid conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound that their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have a liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence that we're sending to surgery\nActually have fatty liver disease Ninety five percent or Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this\nSo that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we might in an adult patients you a question of ... about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing at like ... why should a neurologist do\nBe talking to someone about their weight when that person is there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because how is\nA neurologist isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway these new lives but let's look at what you guys just said and this is I'm going to put all my medical have because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity\nHave a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... there used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patience and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process these I'm getting rid of their migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation\nSo I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them maybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems soon ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the stories that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests\nThe stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refuse to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight I think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor\nAnd I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because not every fat person goes to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life it's fine if you like their habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight in some other way\nAll they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get on a train accident they need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nFat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of fat people this shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight if they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are\nHaving it's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors oftentimes in specialties\nThat are really only tangentially related to weight ducks\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases and an adequate edging\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in a university graduate schools and as a creative non fiction writer and roll and go for August twenty seventh applications at ... dot edu\nNicholas at um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity and medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nI can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients ... bc which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nAnd by western builders believe in customer service is the foundation for success building relationships in western Massachusetts since Nineteen Seventy five western builders dot\nCom [noise]\nYou're listening to the N.

testimony that he gave before\nThe Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says uh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now and we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece is titled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that sat on the radio dot org link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay anything so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific phrases or that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle [noise] drinking yeah how's it play three glasses and trying and you're quite quarters you know ... it's a quarter scare\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nUm because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh was mouth during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a free some\nAnd uh it's a it's a sexual ... and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony he tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important is because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself\nAs a kind of innocent in high school he said he was a Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen\nHe helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the\nMore important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern in which\nBrett Kavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit\nOr any of the things that suggested that he did actually know a powder and think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for that gives you more credible\nUh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he says\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nJudge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later but but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nWho has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is\nThat he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what might I I don't know what might be like kind of a junkie things at Seventeen year old boy say to each other because it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something much much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship at the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\n... the problem is that there's this thing called a sworn oaths and you take it when he testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh as a federal judge and he's seeking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty the whole point is that you have to it's a it's a sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you would look more credible in fact that's entirely the point\nThe reason that he lied about these things\nI'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it would hurt a him in his attempt to make Christine forward looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what are you saying that\nI watched his hands because I wanted to know the truth and and as I wrote in my case I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd PATS de symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not very Cavanaugh I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and a number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like ah Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of a stringing came everybody knew\nWell those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person who's really interested in the truth and to me saying statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew is an example of that faith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and\nHis examples of why this drinking a meant what he said that means which I find kind of felt the mind it honestly\nIs nobody ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have in Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have\nThe I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three uh\nBut that means he's lying and the additional proof as a Nathan's friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area in two thousand eight\nThat's not proof and I don't think that is even this crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know Pete Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that in the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game\nNathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that ...\nI mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing of the proceeds Brett Kavanaugh's testimony you know I'm happy to discuss it I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and\nThe most major lives are much much much more significant\nAh like saying I never attended a gathering with the people forward says now on his calendar on Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you all energy solar helping homes businesses on firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nSays that this didn't happen that's not what lay when Kaiser says Leyland Kaiser says she believed Dr Ford which means it did happen it will say you misrepresented\nActually it would be if she believes belief does not mean that it did happen just to\nBe what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that I was trying to leave it didn't happen she believes that it happened right her opinion is that forward is telling the truth\nRight or not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says what they say it didn't happen batch full that's a false statement that the full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to first of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week or in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept

what those words again we're not looking at the past but what he said contemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court and\nWe're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my ... she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is in an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator ... or a Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened\nPart of what happened for the night before\nI don't know I remember what happened and I think you're probably ... or um and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course has people remember does Kevin uh after a break came back and apologized to senator ...\nAnd I agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breath ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said\nIt's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore ... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to fire Clovis charges that he felt that he had come across too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process as you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very loudly reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human because really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kind of damned if he does and damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he's clear and doesn't you know lie under oath which is the last person is going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system\nThen we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins and said cagey\nUh but if she is colloquial unjust and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen\nWhich is a political way of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember is a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice\nNathan your take\n... what are called colloquial I call falls right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I think cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says\nI was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the question right and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking it's directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations of brands against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs why it's so important for him to be honest and had to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look I I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and\nYou know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time to talk to a dozen of his your costs money to all say\nThat he's misrepresenting his record of drinking\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and bay path university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator ... enrolling for October twenty second applications at

not credible she said it is not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes are different from how he remembered\nThe night before that's what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were participating with him and watched him all say that's just not credible he he he lists finished high school yearbook he's part of the city club tried to get through a hundred ... in a year\nYou know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who feel ... everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was barred Kavanaugh um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will that's full you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also in the ...\nOkay let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the Nathan\nHire a thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did think that for Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted it was when he said people refuted\nThe allegations about him when that wasn't true I also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge street going on as over the top accusations\nBut I don't say the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not a ... he led regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't take that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lying to Congress back when he was getting a lot of tension traumatic ten\nAnd none of the Republicans are cared about it or want to do at the end and I don't think they're doing now and measuring the group of people supporting cap and all\nI saw it very ironic that they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker and my experience was that sort of political slogan used to cover up a trustworthy person\nWell about ... people there's a hash tag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whoever it is that you expressed support for Nathan\nI'm okay I'll I'll I'll open up that far but we I see a lot of yard signs things stand with Walker and like that probably is not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was it was kind of law I'm like oh my gosh sensing\nOh over again Nathan thank you for your call and it's a green let me turn back to Nathan's broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that to judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn Nathan sees he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress at all or congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confront him anyway and uh he he objects to the ... what's your response to Nathan but actually\nNation is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I as a more trying to see more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that the for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink and high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he sat in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says to leave when Carter was there to also said I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr foreign clearly described a different type of gathering et cetera", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "04"}
