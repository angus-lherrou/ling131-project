so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because um I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of whom saying he's gonna he's going to vote Republican almost entirely across as about for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen they're an Ohio things she's going to try and turn a democratic votes so I mean how much\nCan we tell how much has this fight over just as Kevin are really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterms\nWell it is certainly energized voters going to the midterms to question is whether or not the G O P can sustain this\nOver the next month because well I said look the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one upside for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of close is enthusiasm gap they're having trouble closing\nOn their own modality has been confirmed now that they've sort of solidified have solidified out as conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nThe question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I can just over the weekend I can hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of famous as as all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda was bench for the Trump\nOn that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side Democrat in the progressive that they are certainly mobilized and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote or encourage others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this yet another month\nNow Dick Pullman a here in Pennsylvania we've got a brand new district maps congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't a thrown in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's gonna happen here no\nWell I think [noise] you know the capitals things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court\nAh and um they're much more sort of a ... they're much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district um and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things really I think are just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we've been talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is it all depends how to do something\nIs going to land just proportionally in different players so a lot of the house districts where would you are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones in and around Philadelphia ah are\nUm are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans ... over a lot of things Kevin are being nearly\nThe latest so you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the Democrats won't win the house they only need a net gain of twenty three they're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone\nThere's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide federal that Republicans have that\nHillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about enthusiasm is going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate the

affairs and it's a huge ... joined us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and the hill I wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paula uh especially talking about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of ground a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily health care is has that whole sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues are that the the the country still grappling with\nYes healthcare certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington and you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nAnd more ... than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to the repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nA in kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals and that his\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval is somewhere hovering around forty percent it's historically not good and usually the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're ... is at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but\nDemocrats have in more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidate or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Democrats so it breaks down differently in different places that the Republicans have kind of a dream of Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won and about half of them by massive margins right\nWell I mean as you mentioned in and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could\nMake it a tough tough tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet a confirmation ... nomination we are hearing\nRepublican leaders talking about a re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday saying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation had actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically ... first Democrats all the Senate Judiciary committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican voters up particularly the red states where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to suck a lot of the other side for the tactics that have allowed us to kind of energize and get involved are all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or the or the low approval ratings that we have the\nWhile you may be on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know\nHe's doing that in part because uh I don't know much else they they really have I mean we don't we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know their past tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as polling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really hasn't been point very well\nOr they did promise to a ... a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare as a campaign issue this year particularly on the house side there and bracing it and it's not just I just see it around here in Pennsylvania side but over\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nRational see that is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidate by the name of Andy Kim a is every day he's stressing healthcare\nA and they don't talk about you know they're not talking these democratic candidates aren't really talking that much about Kavanaugh much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of\nFundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think where McConnell's doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they spoke it up enough you know the hope and the belief becomes reality but I think they have a a I'm a ways to go on closing the gap\nWill polar read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in uh Pennsylvania New seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women\nThe board were very energized\nI think that's right you have it on certainly something that that trans fat cats here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership interests but I don't know\nNecessarily how much oil guy feel the polls even President Trump's election edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things and I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on there for the health care act in their promise that need and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they want to just circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made the long term changes like that could that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale to just try to do with voters here do you think they should now well\nI yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago uh uh\nYou know maybe there's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on to this notion that ah the courts are\nAre impartial and independent and people and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nUh but the Republicans have successfully a campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe uh the warranty Earl Warren court and how the law you know we need more law and order\nHe campaigned against the court in sixty eight successfully and so so for years Democrats of not they have not stress the court uh uh and I thought that ... what happened with the Merrick Garland in twenty sixty and I think if you flip the parties around\nAnd and a Republican ... Republican president been in office and had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd he didn't even get ahead and get a hearing saying from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why the Democrats yet so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that they make because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and then the Berger court through the seventies things like\nMiranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court banning racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built\nA very very successful and very effective movement a messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates who are at work solidly conservative you know would vote with them and with an advance their goals", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "08"}
