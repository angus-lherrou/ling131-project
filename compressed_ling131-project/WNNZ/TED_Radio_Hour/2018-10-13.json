Want to at the beginning of your career in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating

committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts is deeply deeply defined by class in by race\nAnd so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just brushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin ... on

named James mouse in who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] [noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being it at the time of slavery\nThe person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men were\nActually free men were persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now are all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons because it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven why these recent changes as positive steps toward

farm dot com for\nHead of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defense was the billions of non human animals\nAre and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human animal and I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and a Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Janine before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to\nLondon and after he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was against all baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because in Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures to Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law written hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and get a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a right of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have his purpose and James his body was brought in\nBy the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was odious [noise] that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in it but as far as long as\nStreaming of New England public radio is

you realized you needed to find your genes summers that of course a non human version of James hammers and [noise]\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find her James how much that we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous being that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and we filed\nA hundred and sixty pages of affidavits\nAnd we say altogether it shows that

headache who's advocating for getting rid of the elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers so I I Would\nMake it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand lettuce to random section of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that my ah increased you would then\nFor those who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it than that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes John out of some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy guy out Douglas Adams ducked with settlers and it's just I just got by Douglas Adams saying are the people who want political power as specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one like the chamber in one solution chamber\nOnce with ... and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chain but full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a producer the path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common lightly simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be\nDifficult to Institute the pollen and try to say to your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box\nThe surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist\nThe question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is something that can really spread on a global scale in your
