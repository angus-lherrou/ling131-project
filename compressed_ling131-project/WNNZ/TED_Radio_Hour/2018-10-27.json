you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I\nDo naturally because I've made a stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy out of the New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny relate of away people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that this isn't really has made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about that in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because like even someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without

order to be mean streamed into public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter]\nMy dream in life was three on General Hospital I didn't have that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and\nI had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and thought like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful

sun and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy\nAnd they were trying to open up the conversation about Islam a phobia which at times required little patient\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know there's a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a\nIs a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming\nAnd not too long after he came up something happened back in New York a place where again the usually felt welcomed than accepted\nAnd no hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York

major New York city agency and the comedians one\n[noise]\nA blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nWhat do you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're

could see them having that moment of like oh\nIt's not a whole lot of difference between the three of them good\n[noise] incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off you are a coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing of performing an stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people

what I did as a as a young person when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on\nAnd so my defense mechanism was humor but I also think that humor can be this invitation
