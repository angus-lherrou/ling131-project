been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine\nCouldn't make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you basically attacking like super heroes right perfectly Asian superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the you know that I think that's that's the science fiction association of what CRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or bean or mussels\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of coronary heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology\nThat could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that the technologies are promising like if there was a in a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from in Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nDisease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the richest HIV immunity genes use your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping given that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt so I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] a hamster and Derek is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n[noise]\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question which is who are we\nOkay by the way do you have the answer do you know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] I I have a a a an inkling of where we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipment us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with us [laughter] okay I'll do my best ...\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slate\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand and two in the idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff\n... more than

sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with instinct and
