Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just buy a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interesting well and it is [laughter] is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years\nCorn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sail and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown now you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe you drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them can be bought and any store not\nThat they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself I wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew where we were vegetarians we weren't\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield and shelter and falls community grown and community on since Nineteen Seventy seven\nFood production had become industrial industrial sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually\nMade this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got here pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way [noise] me junk food she is the very stuff that will kill you\nGet any like what you were saying earlier are a lot of it has to do with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want a tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything but you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think a mock Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... and before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because at our broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can\nAs you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients\nAnd plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots the evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food\nEat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories for our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and

[noise]\nSometimes crotch I sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that the soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness a these other attributes that Charles says how our food sounds\nEven looks can change how it tastes\nOne might color I white wine artificially ... within ... tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into smiling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the ... the tobacco and the top chocolates in the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting um ... is the white\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stance on the stage\nOr here this morning to tell you about the perfect meal\nRural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the last\nBut if I look at what's going on it's created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how to measure it I have a tendency among the scientists that when you're a guest on this is this thing people like your eye and the brain gotta\nGive them something to eat something to drink and see which parts of the brain light up the hill that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy is one problem here\nWhich is that in fact in the matter is that one of the brain scan is kind of lie on your back\nWhere they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage that periodically squid sin ah some drink you call what have you ... you had all kind of a jolt an old spoiled the brains ... alignment but it's got to tell you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed ... with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like how many times have you met a friend is just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried and Greek and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned bushes which I'm from the province all rosy paradox that say use to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill you go for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nMissing some well uh on the side\nStreaming of New

and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed [noise]\nYour friends are like this is really cheap ... yeah and he said well how is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain states of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think or texting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way to\nMiss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of that pledge it into what we think about food [noise]\nIn fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement\nAnd you know methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never taste good is it losing about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass break has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting the on the walls of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes or\nAny of that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland tuition and star restaurant\nOr

comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so psyched from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case [noise]\nUh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste\nI work with ... which is if you have here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant I'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when he was actually on the menu that kind of construction something\nThey remember the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and it tastes the food\nOr was there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days justice sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case and your restaurant um do you serve the food to eat in a plastic cutlery nine as a silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at at nature\nSo they they're saying all these things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of food just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd those kind of contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now pumping up starting their own Venus who who are really thing for the first time in history saying\nWe
