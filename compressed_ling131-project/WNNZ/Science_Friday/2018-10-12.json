happy to report both are\nDoing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other selected subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistics ascend which is so called because\nUsually they add make kind of a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of lift and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because ah they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of things that\nAstronauts train for all the time it's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell but but

there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure and how can we security systems\nHow does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my gas Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday Thanks Ira\nYou're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\n... and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their\n[noise] I'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election in two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] the kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things or if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nOr we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases are the rules that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were a phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which ah manufacturers eat whole books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part was\nThat was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the software wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case or is it something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there are there's a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still are not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture pull books and and a deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or or or\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOr as I said last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that there were actually successfully breached but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kinds of attacks but how else could a voting machine compromise\n[noise] well um [noise] ah well that's actually quite a controversial question if you ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making distinctions and I and malaria really helped 'em um and making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from um affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking about um you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked there was a voter registration systems um and then they're they're voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about the voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners on that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to the DEF CON um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to\nI'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the um what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um\nRequire such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them\nUm and you need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and would be easily detected and so um but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing is it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of\nBrute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials do\nOur they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nI'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't have any sort of paper record of the election I mean there are no position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that\nThey're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic an accuracy testing we're doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes in the programming\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed and installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nThinking that the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see it DEF CON but it would but who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate the skeptics that that was\nTrue I I if I could just jump in real quick point um I I I\nI I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but I'm more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and if it's an example of that my an obvious example was election night

the world's nations took their first steps down a long unclear road to addressing climate change\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average

PCC Newsweek cash shed some light on that it highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even at point point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associated with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you go on and will turn out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one of the half degree increase in global temperature all your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to four to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tell this\nBut even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think about small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd good for example\n[noise] except for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to as severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about it on sea ice free Arctic in the summer when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects and I almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the dark in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of the further declining coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent which is just tremendous no\nIt doesn't look like there's any way\nStreaming of New England public radio is one W and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nFinds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on\nThere have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make that transition happened on right now on emissions are roughly fifty to get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even when the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century so this is a tremendous transformation and the composition rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about and it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty or talking about renewables projected to fly Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nOn a lot of different measures I which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the report won't go there with that can you can you answer at least two commission do what they do they use [noise]\nIs your show on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists\nAnd had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assessed all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius\nAnd see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published on and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea um\nAbout a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the times the implications for policy makers so in this case\nI'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report [noise]\nOf oh we have a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so whatever culture and I think what\nEnds up confusing but when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature is at record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn\nGets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced revealed are in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this is really critical of are the highs not just the average temperature and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north American forest grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the ... of the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had all the little ice age but I Wish more that scientists will talk about that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Westfield", "day": "12"}
