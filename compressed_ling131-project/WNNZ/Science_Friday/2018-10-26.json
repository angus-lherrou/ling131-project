be here so ... will go let's talk about how this word directly to the researchers find these Margaret plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took a stool sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers and then the researchers had the sun job of picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic and they found these these plastic types that on nine of them and they were in all of the samples\nStool sample so to his run for our body yep we eat them and then we send about the other end only a matter of time right with all the micro plastics that are around her\nRight researchers that's on micro plastics in tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that all you know a lot of us drink water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic takeout containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nano meter scale\nAnd and we suspect that there is no harm coming from the\n... very difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of parse out um you can't really feed people some people plastic samples and not be other people plastic samples at this point it's just not ethically feasible\nBut um ... which is charged up maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they made in each into the human body so it it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't don't panic because it could be yes it could be harmless but it's very

to deep report to the brain controlling emotion and memory is Christine is on Leno is just the professor at Northwestern University Feinberg school of medicine doctors on and welcome to science friday\nHi thank you I'm happy to be here and we're happy\nTo have you so what is so special about breathing\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and other western ... offering personal and professional gross through its remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nHow we smell and smell is a fascinating and really unique sensory system\nSo evolutionarily smell is our oldest sense it's also arguably the least understood of our sensory systems and there are several\nKey aspects of smell that make it particularly interesting and that make nose breathing really different from mouth breathing so for one thing the smell neurons which live up way up at the very top of our nasal cavities\nThey actually touch the air as it flows in and out of our noses just during natural breathing and this is really unusual because these olfactory neurons are the only part of our central nervous system that makes direct contact with our ex terminal world\nAnd the way that this information get from these neurons inside of our noses\nInto the brain is different from all other sensory systems so all other sensory systems information relays through a structure called the thalamus before it reaches the cortex and higher order brain areas\nBut in the olfactory system information flows straight from the nose\nInto the cortex and higher order brain areas as well without going through the thalamus um and what special is that these olfactory structures are located in a part of the brain called the limbic system\nWhich is involved and emotion and fear learning and memory so this gives olfaction a sort of privileged access to emotion and memory areas in the brain and and because a nose breathing is smelling\nNasal inhalation provides a sort of entry point by which breathing rhythms can modulate brain activity in these structures\nAre so just the activists breathing through your nose was your nose also since the air is coming in and learn these this pathway on the end point in your brain and say something interesting was about to happen\nRight it yes actually it does so that the receptors inside of the nasal cavity\nOr not only responsive to chemicals so they're not only monitoring ah the chemicals in our environment but they also are the kennel receptors so they can detect the air flowing in and out of the\nThe nose yes um and we found that these natural respiratory rhythms just breathing even in the absence of any smell\nOf drives activity in olfactory areas but interestingly these these respiratory driven brain waves they don't stop there so we found that they also propagate to nearby limbic structures the the ones involved and emotion and memory so what this means is that as we breathe\nActivity across the limbic system is rhythmically increasing and decreasing within hails enact sales I'm In this pattern what we found is that it's only present when you're breathing through your nose so if you breathe through your mouth that rhythmic limbic activity goes away\n... you know a lot of us believe maybe erroneous lawyer but you can suddenly smell something that you remember from Thirty years ago right is is that a ... a real thing or a ... and I'm a well for me it's real but why is that something special Tibet due sensory Oregon\nUh yeah you know the evidence is not clear that the study is sort of conflicting on that um a couple of studies have found that perhaps olfactory memories memories tend to be earlier I'm not necessarily stronger\nUm but I Would say there's no clear consensus on on whether or not that's true\n... one of ... what about breathing through your mouth to do anything for you I mean [noise] uh we we use as far as who's tasting food we've always been told that you smell the food through your nose and helps your taste buds taste what it what you're actually doing\nStreaming of New England public radio was wounded boy you all energy solar helping homes businesses on firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThat's what's called retro nasal olfaction so when when we have food inside of our mouth\nI'm the air can get from our oral cavity into our nasal cavity but it flows and the backwards direction so it's going out word rather than in word um and it definitely impacts flavors and tasty us\nTo talk about your study how were you able to study this I understand that you were able to test is within ... [noise]\nOh actually I'm no that's an and that's a very interesting point um we did not use that summer I because in the human brain the olfactory structures are actually located\nVery very deep almost in the center of the brain and making them very hard to reach non invasive Lee so we can't record from these areas from electrodes on the surface of the scalp\nAnd functional neuro imaging uh we cannot really measure\nUm brain oscillation with that technique so to do this study we worked in collaboration with brain surgeons who implant electrodes wires directly into these Olympic areas for patients who are undergoing brain surgery for epilepsy\nAnd this provides is a really rare opportunity to record this type of data\nFrom human olfactory Olympic structures\n[laughter] and if it falls faction and memory are related to you see people with memory problems also having issues with smell [noise]\nAh that that's a really good point um a lot of neurodegenerative diseases actually do present with early olfactory\nDecline um and well I think are these findings that we're discussing or may not have direct implications for neurodegenerative disease I think um [noise]\nThe impact of of breathing on limbic activity certainly suggest potential new avenues and directions of research on on these diseases um for example it you know it'd be interesting to know if these mechanisms may be altered in nerd degenerative disease um and I I also think\nThat our data point to the possibility that neurodegenerative disease could result in all altered nasal breathing patterns I'm breathing is so easy to measure\nAnd this is something that we're looking into in in the lab to do um patients with different neurological disorders do they breathe differently do they have characteristic nasal breathing patterns\nAnd sort of something or you're going to be following up with right yes I Am doing any mirror degenerative disease in particular [noise]\nUh we're we're currently collecting breathing data from patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease to see if we can differentiate the two\nStates just by analyzing the shapes of their breeding wave forums\nOr are we the only I'm going to just throw this hog some really dumb [laughter] are I mean why do we need to breathe through our mouths if we have our noses and are we the only animals are breathing through our mouth\nYou know I I really ... watch this and I've spent a lot of time thinking about that actually I\nI mean I think the answer probably goes far beyond just the sort of immediate thought which is that if your nose is congested you have this alternate breathing route so that you can still get Erin and still live in one that was vital for one um\nBut we're finding that it really drastically changes our brain activity so I think that the full answer to that question really remains to be seen and I think it's a really interesting point I Know that um well most mammals that that I can think of do", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Westfield", "day": "26"}
