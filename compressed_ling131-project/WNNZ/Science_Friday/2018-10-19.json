what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this the worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three birth is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet look at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is that your your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us at ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that lasted series he's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rage can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over UC sections and twenty five percent under used during the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin American and Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call on\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right and it's All right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver last talking about over by us there's it's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\n[noise] well I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction that that you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have the C section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio was well W. all energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money or the environment with solar power all energy solar dog ...\nEducation um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to ... and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\n[noise] um and as soon as area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are\nThere are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth later with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThe not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to producers area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to to stay in the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nWant to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and [noise]\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones to make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical ... eye is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only brand delivery unit that might put some pressure on to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nAnd a highly what's your reaction to the [noise]\nAll I Would completely agree with her that the culture the unit where a woman is giving birth is very instrumental um there are a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have\nStreaming of New

my\nWinter business leaf peeping on the world [noise]\nListen this afternoon at three and this evening at seven on the any PR news network for the world\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid with free at the Yale School of nursing director Tony ... vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's\nSee we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S\n[noise]\nIt it it deters inseparable\nDreaming of New England public radio is well W. an Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nWorld Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on free a very extensive review of the evidence and they found that mid with free was as so seeded with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped the integration of midway free across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice\nAnd so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest the section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of birds are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives and then they met that with outcomes and uh if\nYou look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent of bursts are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado and you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says area and I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd then the last obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor a old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than nowhere more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAs I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for ... back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here it's a bit of Israel and I said you're with your family is from so phone down here in Boston and so there's this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so I one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if\nStreaming of New England public radio is while the ball you other western ... offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches ... western routes coaches dot com\nOr who take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics there's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ...\n... vets relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report\nHolly [noise] well uh ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level the playing field and an end in addition to liability reform\nUm mini in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do as he section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time [noise] mhm [noise]\nYou're you're ... issue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then is his area and delivery\nHowever the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a dummy embarrassment is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because of the length of today\nAnd let's go to Sarah in Somerville mass harsher\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications from Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get the perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if he could leader for a little bit and I really interpret it that kind of it's questioning you know\nCan I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute a tone of your own\nWhich I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and
