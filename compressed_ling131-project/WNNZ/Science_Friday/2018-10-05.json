the twenty the Nobel Prize in chemistry um [noise] hey you know a lot of people think you're a scientist but you were a very proud of engineer are you not\nI Am tell us what the differences well I Love\nTo build things I'd like to make new things that didn't exist before of course chemists do that as well they build new molecules so we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new proteins how do you\nBuild that I was watching a a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] you know it's it's really amazing it's changed so much in Thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type out a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story and we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you say in that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nActually it's easy to write and you know DNA what's hard is composing it you'd think about it DNA is the code of life it's the product of almost four billion years of evolution\nWe don't know how to compose new DNA we can ride it we can read it we can edited but we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three\nSo it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes to ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean in ... whom when you say uh the directed evolution of something what is that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats and dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct to the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct mutations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product that I'm that what's the next step [noise]\nYou put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own and a day in day then take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes than I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic designed to the installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\n... makes them better protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you and take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIs it's sort of creating life in that cell is a new you're creating a new form of life or you're not [noise]\nWell I I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there for me to work with were using the tools of biology to make new things I'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the sale to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise] you don't have to have the self there's now very powerful systems where he can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test to with no cells at all\nAnd so uh where do you eventually see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power\nOf biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make therapeutic agents and an end pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\n... I saw on your talk he said I have fun forcing molecules to have sex with Oh yes I Do [laughter]\nWell if you think about ... you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around\nIf you we combined DNA you get progeny\nWe combined DNA dieting coach something novel\n... she would get a call phone call or two before we have to go let's go to Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nGod has a gun and hand that um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it's the towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on the subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science says it\n[noise] but you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you\nWant to I I was lucky my fires the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls to do math just as well as boys could so\nHe never discourage me and I also had four brothers to compete with and I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know here there's from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentor somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive ... encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm may and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age who was talented in science\nI think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage someone\n... have a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury things\nI Wish I knew\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com harshly\nGenetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nThat can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details that are as we sequence more things and under and measure their properties will be using in Portland and powerful tools like machine learning to peace down in to try to pull out what is the genetic basis\nWell you weren't you in touch with baited my and my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I can be well you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\n[noise] standing at the bar holding a bouquet of flowers looking for a man and my dad who's backing a shiny red sports car brand now but I Want to say to a cool guy in the bigger picture this is the last few don't cry kind of funny\nThings [noise] we're neighbors have some great story for sheer them admitting when public radio and the Academy of music present\nThe best in valley voices story slam on Saturday October thirteenth tickets are on sale now at any P.

R. news network for the world\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow in a time of contentious news indivisible political races Ken we have better conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene Chang mathematician a scientist and residents at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in India logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey along a neighbor\nThat either [laughter]\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOr an aspiring feminist um and I had done so because my logic with that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist system that you might do so knowingly knowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male and the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide you accept them knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to identify as feminists\nUm it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminine them and so I'm being able to see the fact that I can still be a male male experiences while existing feminist um and identifying myself in such a way really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nHe's you know as part of the problem with that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend two don't trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed that he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences so in a way I think the logic we've used very cleverly\nUsing emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analogous experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions do require man he requires empathy empathy is carrying enough to respect another view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think the logic does not require math but logic is in a way politics math\nAnd these things have poor as boundaries I mean we've construct because a lot of us official boundaries between subjects the bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me\nWith logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're mathematician or not\nBut talk about some some of the current events so let's turn now to the oddest topic and current events and that is voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write that in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process says that plagues and tell me what you mean by that\n[noise] well that's a whole other our whole lot of different parts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for things that and things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty\nAnd the thing is that if you have an accuser and and accused but now let's just say that you as a woman and the cheese person is a man then what about the fact that we should also condemned the woman to be innocent until she\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nHold the mom and the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and philosophy has studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that well and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to be innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept\nThat so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so having a false accusation\nUm would be when somebody is innocent spot is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... didn't prove to be guilty and so it left off and that's\nReally about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we're somehow prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo the next for them is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes on so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor land but said on his book that that we are ... just spin the bottle crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale that are all things that are\nAs bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw puffing arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any mind just by accusing him of sexual assault\nWhich again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nAnd finally um that the question of knowledge and alternate hypotheses which comes up in scientific testing a law where you have to decide what you'll default position is and then to say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "05"}
