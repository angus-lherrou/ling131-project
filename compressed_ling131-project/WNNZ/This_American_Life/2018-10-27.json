A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello\nSo Dominique oh let's start with you who the candidates and the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and Abrams would be the state's first black female governor and the race really is statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression of who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\n... rooms have sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the selection comes closer more specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases\nAnd the registration that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nAnd this has drawn a federal lawsuit Kemp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams into the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that\nHer group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nTo be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgia's economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close a there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flag back in the nineties at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag with ... symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race it's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for and the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections\nAbrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media the fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal but campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nStanding rating liberal she's in extreme cases campaign\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting at their eight rooms I'm not sure has done the same with cancer and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia may be more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that I'd Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand ... he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climb if she's going to win this race\nAnd we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W.

to know\nWith the elections disclose people are focusing on the falls to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from ... showing Gillum was one point lead well within the margin of error real clear politics however has\nIt at a dead heat and the president's poll numbers are going out running neck and neck is this the race to watch on election night the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats and if you weren't sure already confirmed this this election is all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like look at it falls only when we're winning I Do like um otherwise\nJoining me now to talk through this NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben either hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans there's new polls this time around looks like Democrats\nAre going to be happier people reading it well it looks like essentially that the Kevin confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans has kind of faded to be perfectly honest\nOr it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republicans quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example the vast majority of those races\nAre being run in places that Republicans hold seats and\nThat has not changed\nLet's get to the pool and the numbers a Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in people's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back the Senate\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Brock Obama was a factor in their vote that\nThe twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around and say that they're motivated to go vote for Democrats because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty fourteen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this is about me get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this is a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat for Republicans vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gap sudden this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote you have fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divide then you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise\nWhen they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote fifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important as here\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential this year across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's also about party democratic men and democratic women alike dislikes\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories science at

Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last month to Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen so if anything that the government has been doing can further that trend of both parties seem to think that's worth doing and that's at least one hopeful story this week\nWe're talking about how this is the the rare period where where both parties are on the same\nPage but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs are kind of pastiche of good intentions are that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem is we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork or programs

health insurance reform becomes law in the United states\nIs [noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare [noise]\nWith the Democrat has to be Affordable Care act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing it we're going to keep our promises\nThat does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe public an effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nHas failed harsher tale of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just from\nOne vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one\nNow is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care fall election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben hey guys hey Hi so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care as their best\nIssue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat and you're much more worry I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that both\nRepublicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined by Fordham sensible health care and not take it away\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota and he has a preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the retina match with Morsi's laws to take away from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily ... away at the Affordable CARE Act for the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans of Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act corrupt try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ads\nCome down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration\nScott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable CARE Act\nThey have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimmed pure plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people a book could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people they have done away with the marketing budget\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield in children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nHave ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places and then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this sort of\nBeen an attack on the AC a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stayed pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that passed and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative cell in South voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace bill that they'll what has done away with your protections for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for reelection are defending themselves from these attacks\nIn an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nThat's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act\nPromising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely staying quiet they knew that the Ford will crack wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out this year how democratic ads yes like Scott's had more than half of them have been about health care this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the saying here's how in building Democrats field is here that's compared to\nFrom twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nAt the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act\nTwo of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate one in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying\nOh I definitely would protect\nPeople with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "27"}
