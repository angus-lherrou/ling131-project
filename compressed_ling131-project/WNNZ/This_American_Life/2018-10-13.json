believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this I'm joined by NPR's to medical ... and ... holiday hey guys\nHey there hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority ruled out the right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections in mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most activist people out to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote\nBut ... why aren't they voting the it's complicated right like some of it is because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters if you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on and it's like there's so many reasons but those are kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also is\nThere are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they want to open they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would take for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of\nNot feeling like their vote matters but also not really caring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerge and that's what I'm Wondering are I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for the audience\nSure sure I mean still the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and then you know this has sort of historically been a problem it's even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a rider on the Las Vegas strip\nAnd why it went there in particular was it had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd it's at Eighteen to twenty five or twenty nine year old is how they allow you that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name as Shelby me that he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system he initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but he just seemed confused with how you vote or never voted before\nFrom what all I Know about voting as a show to poll place and he thought why don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during their\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think to him like\nHe was the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkies is is\nSort of things to be assumed people knew that I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen\nTo twenty nine year olds are the lowest age group for a voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections and mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen then spike back up to Nineteen percent during the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nScreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from certified

air pollution that doesn't come in a gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other EPA proposals up weaker regulations on radiation

stopgap before you got more permanent arrangement of the Trump Administration like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place Ron tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think that Obama Care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from the larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law

the midterm elections we're going to be here with a special broadcast breaking down the issues on the other side [noise]\nWith one of the gyms just figures tax\nOf our charge Republicans once thought the major tax cut they passed would be their best selling point headed into the mid term but\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an\nAll out looting of America the wholesale robbery of the middle class\nWe're going to dig into the policy of the big tax law and how that's affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered this more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are you going to be with you\nSo Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what was in it can you give us a quick recap of what was in this big tax bill\nYeah the big top line things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent or Twenty one percent\nThey also made things a little bit simpler for individuals they made the standard deduction almost double they cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit but\nThey also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction it's that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they were Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill in check\nAnd they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread it on evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nTo say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month those are pretty healthy growth numbers\nPrivate economists and the CDO forecasters they think this is a short lived sugar high that people are are\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nI'll be right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that's the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional Paul\nYeah there than non partisan officials score keepers for all ... all the bills that go through Congress I deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House saying no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nTo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer\nWhat we do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail as far as I can tell\nNo the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kind of high on the uh public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we're marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary thing you know Republicans\nWanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means the government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats as they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut lest they be accused of wanting to raise people's taxes which they often are is this the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed off of campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for the tax bill for months and months and the polling average that they use of aren't real clear politics shows than thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nIn you know the tax cut it had kind of a a momentary high water mark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval but that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower\nAnd that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "13"}
