Yorker and ... the studio\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems and altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy\nBut what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all Sue Halpern has been writing for the New Yorker about election security in what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election he started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election suction assault dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentation\nAnd the this particular searched didn't turn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with us\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nDinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election day there were also\nWindows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I felt in my wildest this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found a security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number\nAnd their driver's license number and then there were also gyms database and the gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count [noise]\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would've been a boon to answer\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker\nImplanting malware on the\nPrograms that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters an attacker could have compromise that Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out\n[noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know\nBut this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms a few months ago the director of national intelligence set the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open [noise]\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cyber security experts citizen green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a across the country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have the paper ballot and then there's also a ...\nSo here's your is offering a special pre Sylvia long term storage as baby ... party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets no you're [noise]\nCourage changed within them and that's why having the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop our regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here's how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that many of these machines that are in the polling location are equipped with wireless modem to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those\nWireless modems go over\nA cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\nWe spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do\nWith the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured county they use electronic pull books\nNeed another we're in this one near ... another way\nSo here's your is offering a special Sylvia long term for our Janice

climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar a different\n[noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and the you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's

like ants you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in
