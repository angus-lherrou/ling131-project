Manhattan [noise] this is the New Yorker radio our coal production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... rock in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York\nBut another story in this election is the very opposite the candidates were running as extreme is on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran who's been covering the movement known as the old right and he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like my concern of itch for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacists had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it\nIt never really not existed but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely know that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it but it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past dot edu\nWhite nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why\nBecause he voted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he vociferously denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King as a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years\nPartly because of trumping partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kind of gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat he doesn't delete them he kind of says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walks back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start at the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than a than a than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number there whites that America I offered this ban extend the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that or I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables have saying by talking about\nAh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is therefore the racist Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forgot how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the G O P can very comfortably washed their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan field that cannot afford to reject somebody like\nPicking it's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou've spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber proud of fascism the fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah the ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nA dicey racial history that I'm perhaps uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about six six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district thing it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seem to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Cory Stewart he was someone who the Virginia GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he he won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments we can't turn them down there our heritage\nHe was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so [laughter] not the heart of the ... of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman set gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is at a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of this extremist voices\nYeah I think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more anomalous cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nCommunity was trying to figure that out\nAnd then the course of that discovered\nThat Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security advisor um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador um essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions\nBut then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating a vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that\nThe Russians and do that too and because this has become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise at church for black males so what does what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see him right away\nTold him what we learned that\nYou know the vice president of been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the VP out there saying this step so we told\n'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd you're going to name a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same way it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before this sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lives to another\nAnd what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod I Would hope he would be concerned about any way but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until it was this you\nKnow ... and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order and she said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd get a call I was able to keep one a week and they want us to my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and So Matt calls me and he says after you left you know I went on line I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issues\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\n[noise] I'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there I'm Talking through\nWhat the challenges were what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges constitutionally and statutory laying otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was that it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just the Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job of a department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have done you know issued the order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy ground perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that um but not direct the department not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe no let it get should go into court and make an argument that it's not grounded in truth but the department of justice [noise]\nI mean [noise] if\nThe OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't grounded and trade 'em but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I was not like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me at my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was on mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and will you saying that you know none of them were asking\nMe will you resign they were asking me will use saying no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did\nYou say no they I mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication\nThat we both we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the direct it to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired\nWere fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you or ... how did you think the story was going to and once you said you weren't going to\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nCertainly recognized there was a very real possibility for probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back and take a breath and look at what they were doing and more ...\nOkay I Know everybody's got a impolite so loud [laughter] and I was kind of silly now doesn't it um but you know I did\nHarbored this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of getting cut 'em there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um\nI suppose you could say that the president made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's\nEver so brief attorney general speaking with Jeffrey to the New Yorker [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe'll hear one more conversation festivals robotic
