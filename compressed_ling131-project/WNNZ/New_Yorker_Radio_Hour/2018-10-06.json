they said to US Senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter\nIf you look at the way flake changed its position afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister is a new book good in mad revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book combined to kind of history of women's uprisings within analysis of the me too movement Traister is written for New York magazine al the New York times in the Washington Post and the last book was called all the single ladies

power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement it's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good and bad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes\nAnd systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about\nAnger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good um [noise] what's that you often\n[noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean I was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before\nAnd um there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women\nI was acutely aware of my identity um as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been lingered by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think\nMore clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I'd been on part of a pod cast\nWith a bunch of women and one of them had said\nAbout the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to\nPersuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted\nFor Donald Trump but I was acutely aware\nOf this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave him be it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nPhrase go get your boys would that going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do with also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women and um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of whiteness in conjunction with looking at gender\nAnd then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work\nHow do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's\nThe story here but everything was so crowded and it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that years his twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was\nFeeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professional\nProfessionally and um I said I just can't think straight dry is I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes so maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the a lot of the exemplar of constructive anger in the book historically a black woman I'm Shirley Chisholm\nFlorence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till

in this book Polly Mary was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's
