under fifty thousand people that's our definition of far off road island Massachusetts were not included Connecticut was concluded and certainly made New Hampshire Vermont test a lot of ... communities\nTo explain a bit more about Medicaid expansion in in what exactly the states were faced with as we understand some states decided to take federal money expand the Medicaid population others declined to but maybe you could give us a bit more detail about the differences in the states that you're studying\nSure so after the Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of the portable CARE Act\nIt became essentially optional for states that they wanted to go ahead and expand Medicaid with federal funds to their low income adults or not and the majority of states have done that but there is still about Seventeen states today that has not\nIn New England Maine is the only state today that does not have it and ... and ... up and running although as you know main voters did actually pass at the ballot last year\nThe past due to the belt last year however it hasn't been instituted in in large part because of the governor of the state of means objection to to medicate expansion well let's start there what exactly has this mentioned to me over the course of this time without expanding Medicaid\nHow have the residents of Maine and specifically in rural areas however they done as far as access to health coverage\nSo name really downtown and our data has\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the past university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay pest dot edu\nAntenna and you know that's a problem for rural communities and may not just for those folks who are not able to get health insurance through Medicaid but it's a problem for everybody living in those communities and that's because rural areas tend to have more provider shortages\nIf you look at the map of hospitals closures in rural areas across the country it's primarily happening in states that have not expanded Medicaid and because health care is harder to combine rural areas those providers it's very hard for them to carry such a big load of uninsured adults\nSo you're saying that when there's a higher number of uninsured adults it means that over time the amount of actual care that's available in rural areas and starts to road\nThat's right if you think about women of childbearing age for example whether or not they are on Medicaid they need to go to a hospital most likely to deliver their baby and if we're all hospitals are carrying a very high load of uninsured patients it's very hard for them to keep their doors open so\nWhat we see today is that man has the highest uninsured rate in rural areas in New England at twenty three percent every other state saw a decline in in some cases of very large decline\nConnecticut actually had one of the largest of clients and the country the number of uninsured adults low income adults living in rural areas started at thirty two percent and two thousand nine and went down to nine percent by twenty sixteen as a result of the Medicaid expansion that's at\nTwenty three percentage points to climate huge decline\nNew Hampshire and Vermont also saw significant declines New Hampshire Seventeen percentage point decline and Vermont twelve percentage point declined\nI'm Wondering what you can tell us specifically in these rural areas that you studied about\nAccess to health insurance actually meeting access to care actually meaning access to better health care results because that's the end goal right is to make sure that we have a healthier rural population do think that these things line up that indeed having access to insurance means better outcomes for health care for rural Rosen's\nIt absolutely does the research is very clear on that we reference a couple of other studies in our report that show actually for clinics in rural areas even experienced greater increases on quality measures such as as a treatment hypertension control for mammograms things like that\nThan in urban areas and and I think that's because there are fewer providers in rural areas it's how important for us to have coverage you know the other piece that folks often don't think about us you and I have health insurance because we want to protect ourselves from medical debt and bankruptcy\nAnd that is a key aspect of what Medicaid provides that kind of economic security so that one isn't slapped with a huge hospital bell and so for communities like rural communities that that often tend to have higher unemployment rates that kind of protection is vital as well\n... is executive director of the center for children and
