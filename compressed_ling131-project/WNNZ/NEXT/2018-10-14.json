England news collaborative and its coverage of climate change and global warming\nBig news in the world of wind energy this week Denmark based forced it will acquire the developer of America's first ever offshore wind farm Rhode Island based deepwater wind or state will buy deepwater wind for five hundred ten million dollars the c._e._o. Henry Paulson says an offshore wind is experiencing international growth\nWe can now say that the cost of green energy is for your competitive way back and edgy and such that no economic reason for not accelerating the transition to clean energy\nThe company currently has offshore wind projects and development with Rhode Island Connecticut Maryland and in New York\nWhen combined with ... other assets the two companies say they hope to deliver offshore wind power to seven states on the east coast by twenty thirty deepwater wind CEO Jeff ... says partnerships like these are typical in the offshore wind industry to complete big projects\nIt's a way of bringing more talent to the table and more people in town and the right set of skills to take on these complicated projects and it also helps to have you know multiple companies with ah the ability to put together the dollars to invest\nRubber ... says the company plans to hire more people for its Providence office and plans to keep their office in New Bedford open the agreement is expected to be finalized by the end of this year even as New England is investing in wind energy projects off our coast the amount of wind energy we use still pales in comparison to states in the so called the wind the belt\nOne such example is Kansas and we spoke with Philip war burg about what states in our region can learn from the states that we usually don't think of as leaders in renewable energy work is the former president of the conservation law foundation and he's author of the book harness the sun America's quest for a solar powered future\nAnd the author of a recent article what red state Kansas can teach blue state Massachusetts about renewable energy Phillip welcome to next thank you for having me\nWe were interested in the recent article in which you wrote about what the state of Massachusetts can learn from the state of Kansas so\nTell us what do you think Massachusetts can learn from Kansas about wind power\n[noise] well I think Kansas is a very pragmatic very conservative state where you wouldn't necessarily think ... energy was taking off but in fact it's real\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nHoward generation comes from wind and that's not because they have some deep abiding concern about climate change just because they see\nThe economics of wind power as benefiting them individual ranchers and farmers who gets an annuity from the wind turbines on their property worth much more than if that small amount of land was used for agricultural purposes\nLocal payments to help with various community projects retail revenues from all of the construction workers who come through and the operational\nStaff who stay there and I think there's also a sense of connection between our reliance upon foreign energy sources and the wars we've been fighting in the middle east we live in a pretty protected bubble\nIn many parts of New England were not that many people go off to fight wars in the middle east but in places like Kansas that's not the case and one economic development chief said to me either we have to put when turbans on our prairie or we have to bury our\nChildren beneath our prairie so that's a fairly stark\nPerspective on one aspect of renewable energies benefits to Kansas\nAnd it sounds as though the the argument is is being made that energy independence that you can do in a homegrown way is something that that Kansas can do by harnessing the wind\nBut it's not that dissimilar from the same argument for drilling for oil in Oklahoma or drilling for natural gas in in Pennsylvania or Colorado is the same type of argument being made\nYeah I don't think there's some higher set of values attached to win relative to those fossil fuels and in fact those fossil fuels as you say are being developed aggressively in places like Oklahoma and actually in Kansas as well one added benefit that this rural county in Kansas where I did a lot of my research firm I win book\nDeveloped was a wind technology training program at the community college it started in about two thousand and seven\nWith some five students today it's got a hundred and fifty students and they find jobs immediately on graduating from there to your certificate program in fact they've expanded now to include solar technology so it's been renamed and renewable energy technology program\nAgain not something you'd necessarily expect at a community college in the middle of Kansas farm country but in fact\nIt provides local employment for a lot of people including the children are farmers who can't find gainful employment on the farm and it's really seen as a huge economic boom\nOne of the reasons why they're able to get thirty six percent of their power from wind is because well Kansas is a windy place just how much windy or is it then then say Massachusetts\nWill it really is and what's often called the wind belt which extends from Texas on up through the Dakotas\nAnd in virtually all of those states UC elevated levels of commitment to wind power because the wind resource is so ... is much more so than on land for example in Massachusetts I think that is one of the constraints that we face here\nThere's better wind in parts of Maine on land in New Hampshire on land not so much in Connecticut are Rhode Island\nWe're beginning to develop those although there's a lot greater concern about view shed protection noise issues et cetera in our more densely settled region than there is in wide open spaces and places like Kansas or\nOr the Dakotas one of the great advantages of offshore wind for New Englanders and for people in the northeast is that\nThat offshore wind is every bit as strong as the winds that you find blowing through the great plains\nIt happens to be very close to major metropolitan center so if we can tap that offshore wind we will be both providing a great new renewable energy resource without creating the kinds of resistance that we experienced here in New England and specifically in Massachusetts to the first proposed offshore wind farm Cape Wind\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal

Philip I mean there's always going to be only so much land or even offshore land that we can harvest the window on\nWell if you actually take off shore into account I'm not sure that limited so clear and if you combine various forms of renewable energy we're really looking at a transformative moment I think in our overall electricity\nEconomy Vermont has set it's renewable portfolio standard as providing a minimum of Seventy five percent of all electric generation from renewables by twenty thirty two so that's a pretty ambitious standard\nEveryone's so excited about ... and they want to try

favorite season or at least is my favorite season here travel experts Samantha Brown is co host of the show Samantha welcome to the ... for joining us Oh thanks for having me could you explain what autumn watches because it seems like it's a pretty big undertaking\nIt is it's huge so autumn watch is eight live event\nThat will be on a Wednesday October seventeenth Eighteenth and nineteenth at eight pm on your PBS stations and it is to celebrate all things autumn\nFound the fall foliage to the festivals the food the customs and the customs they range from our Native American populations too early European to modern day but it is everything we love about this very fleeting time of year\nSo you're presenting it as a as a live show why this format because obviously there's a lot of great travel programs and magazines that celebrate all the things you just said but what's the reason behind doing this is a is a big live TV event\nWell I Know from my point of view um I Love the live event because it makes it immediate and now\nAnd uh you know these days we consume a content anytime you want it's on demand and we binge watch programs a month after they are presented but autumn itself is not on demand autumn is not something you can dinged two months from now it's happening now so the life event\nReally um heightened that reality that these are the moments of the year that we take time as a community as people as a nation and just enjoy the change from summer to winter\nSo this program this idea comes from the BBC who you're working with on this talk about the decision to do it in New England I mean for us very per eventually we think that this is the best possible places to celebrate autumn but tell me a bit more about the BBC's plans for this because you know obviously autumn happens elsewhere to\nExactly you know I'm from New Hampshire so that was my opinion I said well I Know I Know why you're here but you know I've I've traveled all over the United states and it is experienced elsewhere\nAnd what I didn't realize about my own region is that we have the spectrum of color that is unlike anywhere else in the nation we have\nThe highly valuable red color which comes out with our sugar maples so we have red and orange is where a lot of other states and mountain regions have yellows but we have the great spectrum of color\nAs a native New England or do you think that we take this for granted 'cause it's right here all the time or at least once a year\nYou know I I don't think so I have loved it since I was a child um I spent Twenty years growing up in New England and it was something that I always look forward to and it is still my favorite time of year\nAnd you know I hear a lot about well how do you know it's going to be peak foliage while you're there for a new Englander there is no such thing it's it's beautiful no matter what\nBecause there's so much that goes into it and so much\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you or other western ... offering personal and professional gross through its remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nApples to pumpkins that everything about it is a peak experience\nSo much of your travel reporting revolves around the culture of a place and how do you hope to present the culture of autumn in New England during this\nProgram so for me culture is always about the effort that goes into creating the experiences that we travelers just get to show up and have and I think that is something that is travelers we do take for granted that\nPeople have worked generations to create something that we just get to walk and so for instance I did a segment for autumn watch in where ... and that is right at the beginning of Cape Cod and that's where they harvest cranberries and to understand that this goes back so many generations\nAnd the idea of harvesting cranberries with something that you know the the Native American population passed on to the European settlers and we have it today I didn't realize that and that's what I always want to convey to an audience that we always need to respect\nThe the the work that went into what we get to just enjoy and not just be you know be less consumers and more a part of the community\nA lot of the reporting that you did in advance of this live program also includes a look at our ecosystems our environment and some of the animal species here including one about the tree swallow migration and southern Connecticut what can you tell us about\nThat [noise] so this is something I had never experienced in my life I'm the tree swallows do a massive migration down to what other wonderful southern Caribbean islands that they're headed to but there is a ruse sting nest point on the Connecticut River and so for talk about fleeting every night for maybe two weeks\nHundreds of thousands of trees follows gather so you look up at a sky and its blank\nAnd within Fifteen minutes the sky is filled with hundreds of thousands of birds and then they start to create these beautiful undulating shapes as they are all kind of figuring out what to do and then one by one and then all of them just drop\nAnd it looks like it's raining birds down into disrupting site and then within Fifteen minutes it's over and it's as if nothing happened\nAnd so this is something that you get to experience and and we spend a lot of time in the show in autumn watch understanding how the the season affects the animals whether it's in migration are just sort of they're nocturnal patterns what\nAre some other stories that that you're planning on telling over the course of this of the few days\nWe are going to do everything from a lot of wildlife from moves to the monarch migration also great white sharks\nThe trees follows which I got to participate in the customs of course the foods and the festivals are also be going to look pony up for the pumpkin festival um which is one of the largest in the United states in my home state of New Hampshire and so it's just a way of showing just how\nAll types of people enjoy this one time of year whether it's wildlife to customs for the Native American population we will be with the Narragansett tribe which is out of Rhode Island and they can trace their roots docked at thirty thousand years is based on archaeological evidence\nSo we can we take we take a little bit from everybody and everything that contributes to this great time of year\nIt sounds as though some of the stories are presenting true surprise for you and the other other reporters because I think that one of the things about all of them in New England that we cherish use that it's kind of in itself like a warm cozy sweater we know what to expect right they'll believes fall\nThe site or most of the apples are victims are ... ... and the pumpkins are carved but but you seem to be present in a lot of things about autumn in this region that are are newer surprising", "year": "2018", "show_name": "NEXT", "city": "Westfield", "day": "14"}
