who's written desk on ... and other misadventures in means Baxter said park she's also the author of death on Mount Washington she warned us about the dangers of hiking in New England and told us what to do to stay safe Randy welcome to next\nThanks for having me now your book death on good on details of the events leading up to many of the sixty four deaths that have been recorded there since Nineteen thirty three in the park maybe you'd start by telling us the story one of the stories that stands out to you the most about the people who've perished while hiking there\nWell you know there's a story about four young men who went up the mountain together who were climbing they started out on a warm fall day and suddenly it turned into a tremendous blizzard the kind of blizzard that you'd\nSee once and may be Twenty years\nWhen temperatures fell into beyond the single digits down into the negative digits and these poor guys were stuck on the side of the mountain on a ledge all night in this crazy weather and remarkably most of them got out only one of them died\nHe just you know sadly hypothermia got him but\nThe others managed to find their way out the end of the scariest thing was no one was looking for them\nBecause people assumed that they had made it back or that they were camping somewhere on the mountain and that they were All right so no one was that there was no no wonderful main search and rescue team out looking for them and they staggered back pounded on the rangers door and that's how they got out alive\nA lot of the stories though do deal with the the rescue operations the very difficult situations that people have to put themselves in in order to to help people who have been stuck on the mountain and you write about the death of ranger Ralph ... this was some time ago but this is a this is an important story tells about Ralphie\nThe saddest stories are the ones where a ranger rescue person loses their life\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nWhen the woman hiking with Margaret ... who was stuck on the mountain\nHelen ... came back and told the rangers that she's stuck on the mountain she can't\nCan't get down she tried taking a short cut and there are no short cuts down from ... you really have to stay on the trail so the ranger couldn't sleep knowing that there was somebody stuck up there and the weather had changed that says the curse up there that the weather can change on a dime\nAnd ah he went up looking for her and she found her and actually made or as comfortable as he could\nBut then he himself that stuck on the mountain and died of hypothermia and sadly so did Margaret of ...\nIn these stories are important because every time someone goes out\nHiking maybe ill equipped maybe during a time when the weather is changeable there is that real possibility that of a search and rescue operation could turn deadly for the people who who are conducting that search that's a really important message to get across\nThat absolutely is and I hope that in these books I Am getting that across\nThat these people risk their lives to bring somebody else out of the wilderness in some cases you know someone has an accident but some people do go off into the wilderness now paying attention to weather reports\nNot being well equipped and you know these people go out and risk their lives and every once in a while one of them doesn't make it back [noise]\nAnd it's it's a heartbreaking situation when that happened\nMaybe you can talk broadly about how hiking in New England might be different than in national parks elsewhere in the country because we don't have the highest peaks necessarily we don't have the hottest temperatures but we do have some very specific climate conditions here what's different between New England parks and and the rest of the country\nWell you know as you say people people come to New England to hike expecting a milder experience and they're going to find\nA on angels landing in Zion national park or out and mount Rainier or one one of those without fourteen thousand foot mountain they think it's going to be easier and you know it isn't\nOne of the big things is that you've got this weather coming down from the north across the ocean from the east sometimes up from the south all at the same time and that can create storm system said they just don't see out west\nSo we have different kinds of hazards up here and people need to really be prepared for what they're going to find even though they're hike is only going to take them five or six thousand feet up\nThe stories of people who die in terrible circumstances like this obviously capture the imagination can you give us some sort of context though about you know what sixty some deaths over the course of you know nearly a hundred years on Mount Qatada\nMeans given the thousands and thousands of people who get every year I mean what's the percentage of people who really get in trouble\nYou know the percentage is so small it's almost not worth trying to compute generally it's less than one person a ear\nAnd when you look at it on ... and a hundred thousand people voted ... state park every year and maybe one and maybe not any there will not come out just five\n... well maybe you could just leave us than with a a bit of a checklist what some advice you give to individuals who might set off on a hike of mount ... Washington especially this time of year in the fall when you might think it's beautiful to get up to the top of a mountain and see all the all the foliage what are some things you might ask people to to think about before they go\nWell you know you've really got to think about what you're carrying in terms of making sure that you have the proper amount of food with you absolutely water is very often the the thing that really gets people that they just sit in cherry enough water with them and they become dehydrated and then you get a little crazy [noise]", "show_name": "NEXT", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "28"}
