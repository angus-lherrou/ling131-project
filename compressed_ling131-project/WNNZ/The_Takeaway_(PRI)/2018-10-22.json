farm to orchestrate digital attacks against dissidents and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard if the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTroll farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know just to field public relations were crusts or a customer across something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations during the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this is to attacks content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that uh say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort to somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin ... man who was you know the sort of the factor ruler up to kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes an away unreasonable they also try to game the algorithms to Twitter\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nOr there's some cases it may have actually been created created by them they can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that and don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian place that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers or government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this has got to be this great new technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they're able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who you know our trolls are called air sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on these social media to base in trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they say they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending lists on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective and um they ... they end up playing a real social media plays a very large role in these countries in just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media does in any country\nBut the the difference of Saudi Arabia is that they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they got on Twitter that can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them perceive their own their\nOwn government but you also reported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person\nWell we know that there was the Saudi engineer Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then Twitter was basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he has been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using has access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because I'm ... death um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns with the not\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat an English he would interact with people he would've post articles and\nYou know so so for someone like him this is a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like to have that many followers just on his own Twitter account so\nThey put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments and lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out as being received by people\nAt least enough to make clear that Twitter as a company has been under fire\nFor a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on its platform and how it controls when people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they ah said anything about all this time folks from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of the Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nI'm not aware of any direct response from Twitter to the article that we [noise]\n[noise] we

and get your ticket today at anything you're done now\nGo I'm Talking about a large sort of a network I think they called it that they had taken down that was sort of a pro pro Saudi bond that worked at Twitter had taken down\nSo you know they they they are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executives speak about this they say you know well we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking\nThings down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find a balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are enough areas\nThan Hubbard is the ...

that moment he blew himself up killing people who are around him but having said that for all the tragic loss of life that that wall by up gun standards this was an epic ... Kelly\nBad set of days many people that fit that that would be in a lot more major attacks I mean I'd been reporting from Afghanistan for last a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example ... I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one thing that attack and we didn't see anything like that except from a security perspective that to me that ... people who were killed that wherever attacks people why in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that\nEpisode will voting stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would be\nConsidered democratic by the electric because of the attacks in the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand that a lot of people ah quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption\nI sleep to being in in Afghanistan over the last a week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that in these elections are unlike in previous elections and number the candidate for young with from professional backgrounds but wet educated\nAnd and people felt that they were in a position to offer of guns are some real political change and move away from a kind of system of politics that dominated by\nEthnic ... by over ...\nHaving said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan of delays that occurred during the election protests are a number of polling stations didn't open on on on Saturday or open late as they were voting hot to be extended into Sunday\nOr what I was that some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that despite having\nRegistered they couldn't

both to more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so there has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of these elections\nYou mentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates that are running I'm Wondering are there any themes are there any common political threats that they share you know something that might be resonating with this electorate\nAnd well one thing to note is that in enough gone to San Juan parliament isn't particularly powerful in comparison to the to the position that the president um\nThe second is that the political parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates stand as independence even if they are affiliated political parties because political parties in in the country often associated with\nA science journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to that and he was still a lot of people who will form a journalist or civil society activists standing and these with
