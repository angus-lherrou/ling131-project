us\nThanks for having me I push it to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around that platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years is that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore essentially only exist to fight this bill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started here down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this bill that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that well I mean that's I think that's open to debate certainly and I'm at the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do it they can the problem is\nIs that when that hurricane roll through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life that's the company and with the company says now the company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing potentially greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the sediment away could make the leak even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government and the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else down there below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil spill is back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty can I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill anywhere lake on loop and
