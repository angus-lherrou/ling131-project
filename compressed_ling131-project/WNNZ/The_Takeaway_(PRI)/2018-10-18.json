down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as place on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy\nAnd while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays than the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWhitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public\nNow about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case than a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nI think they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably do some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nA and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case which wrapped up\nWith a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western ... offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches ... western mass coaches dot com\nOr an actual criminal trial that you know went under way so let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is it it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen\nI'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and no sooner was the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a sanctioned it was the third or fourth one this year actually I'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse\nSo uh they're having players suspended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and that they do not necessarily\nWait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to the victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account um and overall the process it a little bit\nA kind of like have seen this case it's a little bit um non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy you know was Seventy five games out of Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what I'm obese investigation\nConsists of 'em so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you're saying\nHe's the third highest you know number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the suspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players offended for\nSteroids or performance enhancing drugs which are not eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms there are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think on a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon to actually make the team\nWhat do you make of that yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for\nA an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did when the world series and it worked and fans kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it widow sooner um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he's gonna win he could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros

T alliance that I think is I'm I'm allied are very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration\nUm I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and the political map of the middle east by pursuing a series of\nVery aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian uh allies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab Spring\nI think we will to think that you know millions of people many of them young I'm with aspirations for a better future are simply going to accept to live under different forms of despotism forever I think is wishful thinking I think in many ways that really is the um the foe Steven bargain to many people in the west\nHave calculated on that these authoritarian regimes can simply keep things under control assuming that people will be too tired or two I'm disillusioned to resist and revolt of course with revolutions and revolts we never can predict what will happen but almost certain of another ... to some form is inevitable\nWell and I well also you know the Arab Spring was in twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different a moment um at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering um what about that long standing relationship and support that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had\nA this isn't a Trump phenomenon solely this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time do you think that uh that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected by what we're seeing right now in the ground\n[noise] well I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um to suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U.S relationship to the region goes back to World War two where the United states effectively\nI'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em or autocrats in authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about what ...\nThe United states and specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of this coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nWhat could potentially be ... um last moments um and then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it's simply going to um um perpetuate a very um\n[noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh is responsible for a lot of the regional instability so I think the danger here that it's simply going to deepen the instability in the region it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington DC

problem this goes across the political spectrum\nAnd as I stayed at a moment ago as deep historical roots this is the consequences of investing in authoritarianism and political tyranny and ignoring

that impacts what people their understand about what's happening in the rest of the region\n[noise] the role of the press and the media in Saudi Arabia is to effectively repeat\nThe propaganda oh the\nSaudi royal family I mean there is no independent press there is no free media that's one of the reasons why ... had to leave and moved to the United states um and so the role of the media in Saudi Arabia is not that different from the role of the media and any authoritarian regime in Saudi Arabia I think it's much worse because the the the nature of that level the repression\nParticularly

it's\nIt's important that we think about this this concept and this idea of the free press\nIn relationship to U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing a free press in Saudi Arabia we
