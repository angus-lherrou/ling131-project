believe that my admissions file my application could not have been as compelling as it ended up being for my admissions officer\nHad I not been able to talk about my race you know really meaningful

have benefited\nFrom having a diverse student body in a diverse campus I think that in fact the conversation has evolved to actually be\nAbout how Harvard could be doing more for it's good to do

American Latin Latino Native American groups I'm a kind of diverse or make sure that those voices are part of the student body on campus to provide a diverse learning environment\nUm and this you know this kind of holistic look is what I think gets a lot of under a lot of people's skins ought to people want to go to Harvard\nBut um it's a it's a there's not\nOne formula in which to get into Harvard and when\nYou know one and twenty students was applying is getting in and it's really hard to make sense of you know there's nothing you can do to ensure a entree to Harvard\nWell of course but you mentioned on the under represented groups you did not mention Asian Americans or legacy students that I'm Wondering why that was not that I could see students or I Want to be very clear that's a separate group altogether that sort of has a you know admissions officers really consider that\nYes so um they ... I'm again I'm not part of undergraduate admissions I teach graduate students um but what you know what the admissions office to say um which is true of most elite colleges is that they consider\nThat children of people who went to Harvard at some kind of affiliation get a kind of closer look they get an extra read and you know they do get a small leg up\nUm and um and uh in terms of Asian Americans on there you know this that the university denies that they're they're giving their penalizing Asian Americans\nI'm In the admissions process and this you know I think that what the scientists are trying to do in this case is to tie this question of are Asian Americans penalized if he's if he writes to our whites penalized speeds of the um underrepresented minorities um\nI should say that you know there's a compelling ... in the end of the law there's a compelling state interest to give a boost to underrepresented minorities for this diverse learning environment\nThe Congress is not true between you know when we're comparing Asian Americans to whites and admissions\nOh we're going to be right back with Natasha ... worry coups and watch you in just a moment [noise]\n\nParticular waves supported by as low dedicated to helping entrepreneurs and freelance by offering business banking designed to be accessible and straightforward with built in in more mobile deposits went online to learn more easy a little dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe PR news network is funded by you and your nose and throat surgeons or worst or New England offering state of the art diagnostic treatment options for allergy sufferers ... surgeons taught us\nAnd bought him a T McClellan to designers makers in bars with ... purchasing stay diamonds gems stones or loom jewelry M.
