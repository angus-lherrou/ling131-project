facing off against GOP candidate Ron dissent is and voters are closely watching how each candidate is handling the hurricane response effort\nThirty ends will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of the three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently takes away the vote the right to vote from the convicted felons excuse me and there are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections that emerged during the primaries\nWill turn out again next month David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway thanks for having me\nSo there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how is this storm like Michael affecting or it could affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWell um where Michael hit a interestingly is a heavily Republican area and it really wiped out um a lot of the roads the ah infrastructure and so immediately we're seeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle\nUm be ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election days so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most populous counties\nBut that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset the table for the campaigns\nUm you know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and uh those issues like the economy and red tide were\nPretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused in the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some statewide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as\nGovernor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor of Tallahassee to handle the storm or Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to shift his campaign\nTo remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\n[noise] so do we do we know that that's affected gallons lead at all that he's had to sort of taste step aside to handle the hurricane or his campaign still going pretty well\nThe the polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by saint Pete polls are came out this morning the really the first poll a taken to ... to potentially show hurricane of fact and it still had Gillum ... plus one\nUm I I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on the the media rotation during and after the storm more dissent is ah didn't have a invested role and the recovery and the preparations\nAre so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or weeks or to see whether we'll see any other shift but um it's in a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point uh I don't think we're going to see either\nAndrew Gillum or raw descent as a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\n[noise] well late last month we saw a University of north Florida pool that had a the ballot measure at Seventy one percent support it had to get on the ballot or the backers of

sixty percent to pass a valid question and I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're going to see some skepticism\nFrom people who either may not totally understand what the image seeks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole in order to have their rights restored and then there'll be questions from voters about\nYou know to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted\nCertain nonviolent offense is a and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that the Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect um deliberate majority\nWell right on the seven member court there are three of a four justices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc and have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down\nUm the day that the next governor is sworn in and given that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have such divergent opinions on what the court should look like\nThat seems likely to to energize\nA they're voting base is I I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court might have actually a given Ron dissent is a bum who was trailing\nI'm pretty consistently in the polls by a decent margin a and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that uh that a controversy energized for the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with the Santa's over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and um and that might have given him a bomb so probably better for dissenters than for a gallon by certainly\nPlanned Parenthood ah abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I I don't think that you know a liberal voters are just going to throw up their shoulders and and think about other issues\nNever a dull moment in Florida that David Smiley from the Miami Herald that political reporter thanks so much for being with us
