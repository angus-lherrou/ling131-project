county was on the ambiguous\nKnees in Trump's mid west they all appear to me retaliating against industry affected by Trump country working\nBut with all the focus on white rural voters who turned out for Donald Trump another important group of constituents is usually ignored\nThere are black people living outside of cities living mostly in the south and living in red states right to the black belt overlaps with Trump country and those are the folks that are really going to factor into elections across the south in these midterm elections\nThat Aaron Haynes whack and she's the Associated Press national writer on race and ethnicity and recently she's been reporting from rural counties in Georgia and part of what's called\nThe black belt the black belt is that what we know is the deep south which you know historically is where slavery thrived or where you know the wealth of the plantation system was created and obviously when slavery went away these became some of the most impoverished areas in the country\nBut the black belt is also where frankly the battle for voting rights for African Americans was was waged\nAnd so you know you think about Fannie Lou Hamer Ella Jo Baker Fred Shuttlesworth John Lewis these people weren't from Baltimore Cleveland or New York you know they were from the deep south and they expanded that franchise for all and you know this is also the place where\nIssues like voter suppression continue in persist today and so that's one of the reasons why it's really important to focus on these folks and how they're going to factor into November\nAnd you mentioned voters depression um tell us a little bit about some of the other issues that are really top of mind for black working class rural Americans\nBecause a lot of these areas are poor they struggle with economic development opportunities a lot more than than urban areas but they also have healthcare challenges specifically as we know minorities often have\nStreaming of New England public radio was willing to go you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nBut they don't necessarily have the access to health care that you would have say in a city you can have dozens and dozens of churches for example but no hospitals for miles and miles and that's a real challenge for them and something\nSomething that has has not been addressed frankly by by the folks that that get elected in those parts of of the country a lot of times\nAnd in your piece you went to Georgia to report this out why did you choose that state well\nGeorge was really really important because\nIn Georgia there is obviously a very a high profile gubernatorial contest where possibly be first African American woman could be elected governor in the country and that Stacey Abrams\nAnd Stacey Abrams actually started her campaign in South Georgia where a lot of these black rural voters Liz and the reason that that's important is because you know about a third of the rural folks in Georgia are people of color\nAnd so unlike other contest local contest for example that may be\nDilute the power of people of color frankly because of of racial gerrymandering you know in a statewide contest these are the voters that could really be key to to those kinds of victory and frankly you know what she has done go into a lot of these places that have been forgotten\nBy Democrats in recent cycles could make the difference in the in that contest and others in in the south where you have a large populations of black folks especially in rural counties\nAaron one thing that comes across in your piece is that the black rural populations that you spoke to felt disaffected by politics that seems to be shifting and I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about that\nWell one thing that's important to think about for these folks is because they felt like they they they were electing people who were forgetting about them kind of in between election times you know they they were they were\nVoting for people who then did not come back and give them like I said the economic development that they were looking for or the health care\nThat they need and so they felt like at least in these off presidential year elections that their vote didn't count you know you've got now\nFolks who look like they're running in more of these places are in in in several of these counties that I went to you have incumbents who've been in office for years in some cases even white conservative lawmakers at the local level\nRepresenting majority black counties and and I wondered you know how that possible well these people have gone on challenge\nFor so long or people you know have not paid attention to those local level elections and so these people have stayed in office but but now that starting to change if folks are starting to get more engaged in these local uh down ballot races and realizing that that they can also make a difference right and and\nWhat's interesting also is that I interviewed therapists marsh is a journalist and a couple of weeks ago and she was talking about how white progressive rural voters feel that their perspectives have been forgotten in the Trump country narrative freight\nDid rural black voters also feel like they were being left out of the media narrative or was that just something\nThat wasn't even a concern for them no I think\nIt definitely is a concern because you know I brought this up to them you know doing my reporting it now a lot of them now to their heads in agreement I you know they're not front of mind when you think about rural voters or even farmers I mean black people there's never been a time in this country when black people have not been connected to the land\nAnd so the idea that somehow we have been distance from that narrative is really interesting to me I mean I'm from the south and so obviously for me that's not something that's foreign but but for a lot of folks that that are in cities and maybe you know either don't have relatives are aren't getting back\nTo to that part of the country to see family or friends it doesn't always occurred folks that yes there are black people living in rural areas and and quite a lot of them frankly\nI'm curious if you think there could be the potential for coalition\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nAnd rural black voters who might be able to see some opportunities there for cross pollination if you will of ideas or is that just to is it too early to tell right now well you know I\nThink it's entirely possible and I say that because again when you're in a small place like that you know these are folks that are interacting\nSo much and not to suggest that there are still places like that where there there is segregation and people are living in different parts of town but the town is so much smaller than say a big city and so these are folks that really do\nKnow each other you know I I think of a recent campaign stop this day the Ames had down in plains Georgia\nWhich is the hometown of former President Jimmy Carter\nAnd you know the idea that the two of them would be on the campaign trail together President Carter has endorsed her\nThey're talking about rural health care that's something that affects both those progressive white rural voters and black rural voters and so you know understanding that they do have shared interests I I think does present an opportunity for just that kind of coalition that you talked about\nAaron ...

violence\nThese women may not be aware of the legal options available to them or those options themselves maybe limited\nMany of them say they fear deportation if they contact authorities over the last several decades a secretive network of Latinos have sprung up in California to help those suffering from domestic abuse women who essentially opened their homes at shelters for abused women\nBusy presser is a contributing writer for California Sunday magazine and she reported on this underground network of women giving abused immigrants safety companionship and even medical and legal advice\nPresser says there are about one hundred and fifty other let the women nationwide doing work similar to what she saw in California and she told me about one of the women she followed in her reporting so I ...\nAnd she's opening her home in one of the women who who she's working with as a woman who I call Sylvia um she has been in an abusive relationship for many years and for a while she was struggling to leave because she was nervous about\nThis going public with her story at all since Trump was elected she became much more nervous about the threat of deportation and in particular about losing her children and so\nShe came to Valentino house in state for a week and now Valentino sees her regularly to check in on her and she understands that this is a long process right now the average an average woman tries seven times to leave her obese a partner in this country when you're an immigrant women that can be\nEven more difficult what is a new visa\nAnd how does it play into this conversation we're having I'll step back a little so the violence against women act was first passed in Nineteen Ninety four and it was the first federal legislative package that was designed to end violence against women and it included a piece of legislation that\nProvided a path to permanent residency for abused immigrant women whose spouses where their abusers and who are also us at a central permanent residents the really small fraction immigrant women in\nTwo thousand but the reauthorization of the violence against women act that was expanded and you'd be so it was created and offered a path to permanent residency for immigrant women who were victims of violent crime and who were willing to\nHelp with the investigation and prosecution of that crowd and it was bipartisan legislation so that ... is that where does it stand today in the past four years have seen an enormous backlog grow in twenty four team the government was granting visas to women who had applied five months earlier if you apply today you will wait nine years for a visa\nThere isn't a hundred and twenty thousand person to clock so they're kept at ten thousand a year\nI'm In the same timeframe you've seen the number of a Jew Decatur has dropped from Ninety three to sixty at the last official tally\nWhy is there such a delay and is that delay what spring these women in part to seek services quote unquote underground\nIt's hard to understand why there's such a delay and why there hasn't been a surplus or an addition of educators to help speed up the process\nIt's a good question about whether that delays driving people under God of course we don't know causation necessarily but definitely the woman who I was speaking to her opening their homes were finding that\nSurvivors who came to them just didn't want to wait nine years they couldn't wait nine years right\nSo that means that for nine years they don't have the protection of a work permit so they can't necessarily support their children and that's what the you either was designed to do to to give people a pathway to residency so that they would be able to leave safely and to support their families\nAnd you know the Obama administration um how do you know had very controversial ... policies regarding immigration I'm Wondering are these would have been more concerned under today's circumstances under the Trump Administration or was there equal concern\nUnder the Obama administration if so what's the difference today I was wondering the same thing and I was actually I'm somewhat surprised to learn that does concern is much much higher today than it was under Obama's administration the concern of ... and the concern of the concern of deportation a lot of the women who\nComing to the safe house is essentially under the Obama Yemenis\nStreaming of New England public radio was willing to go you know all the energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nYou say felt as if Obama's deportation priorities were much clear and now those priorities had been why didn't so broadly that they really just don't know\nOne of the other things I heard a lot in this reporting was fat women felt particularly afraid about separation of families it's just all over the news and this way that they believe that it's possible that their family too could be separated\nWhen these women come to violent or do they ended up staying just temporarily do they end up going back to their abuse the partners like what have you seen yeah so ... estimates that about half of the women who have stayed\nWith her have gone back to their partners it's really really difficult police\nAnd a half have left some stay for a night some stay for two months so it really depends on the women and Valentino is feeling is it's up to them and she'll do what what works best for them I mean I've met I met some women who are opening their homes have found that the survivors stayed with them for as long as the year\nOne of the problems at the shelter system is that there's an expiration date um if you are if you are lucky enough to find a better than a shelter which is extremely hard to do you often have sixty or Ninety Days maximum and then you have to get out and so these them and feel like the least they can do is kind of extend that day\nWhy does the network need to be a secret some of the women don't necessarily call it a secret and would actually speak about it more publicly others feel as if it's too risky to say I'm bringing in\nWomen whose partners are abusing them because they feel as if there's a possibility that if you there will then come after them some of them had kids living with you know and they're trying to protect their families and that kind of protect our communities and in part it's because the survivors themselves\nWant to disappear they feel as if they can't get a restraining order I don't feel safe going to the police they can't get a restraining order they don't want to live in the same city that their abusers they prefer to move to a different town and start a new life\nAnd then they would prefer if their location was secret until the women who are opening their homes respect and honor that is there anything we should be thinking about culturally because we're talking about Latinos in particular are there\nAny uh cultural distinctions that come up and dealing with domestic violence there's so much work that needs to be done at the ground level just to get women to feel comfortable talking among people who they know about what's going on in their home or what's\nGoing on in the workplace and we can't be failing to see that can't be missing
