D science in San Francisco and she's been reporting on the measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today Danielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway\nThank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from a state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents on it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke\nTraffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to ... changes\n[noise] there's pretty good data that that loss of sleep um throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why uh props up and wants to be a at the white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there is some popular support for keeping the clocks steady or around also when we are using daylight saving time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because a public health benefit because people are out exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sport there walking the dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can you remind us\n[noise] yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time out if it was in the late Seventeen hundreds\nHe was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habits to sleep a to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon and one morning he got woken up by this loud sound at six AM\nAnd realize oh the sun's up I could be could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany the was the first country to Institute it and then I'm all of the countries that were involved in the war effort\nAdopted daylight saving time to save energy and it did use to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars was brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight savings time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switched to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened then\n[noise] [noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight saving time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo but it was incredible\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nNorthern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the shaft of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes [noise] you know on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so here for instance in California if this proposition passed and California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported it as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless measure that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness\nEducation pathway for immigration prisoner farm ... even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take I don't know why\nDidn't you know we've just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with the decrease accidents and increased
