your guy is speaking out for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel\nIn Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examine by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story and she says the lawsuit documents that she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are signed by rebel do himself\nFor NATO denies the allegations and it's called the story quote unquote fake

and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet well\nKevin or does actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about the ... occurred in two thousand nine\nShe was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress\nAnd she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which is a policy I guess you could see his entourage\nSo he according to deter Spiegel article and her her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't sure\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warnings for anyone listening he was very ugly\nStreaming

documented a sane\nChristiana run all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop so this is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and under and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and filed a police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh what's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost in this so coupled with her own trauma and the\nYou know mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player and a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players an aspiring at that time\nSo it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not as experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was and aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer [laughter] so I mean this is part of the problem with a system sure and\nThis is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story and this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nUm and I will say this very honestly is because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis is first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in a sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere it made no waves they think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do examining we pitched this story about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Cristiano Ronaldo has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest teams in the world\nAnd that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not as popular here I Would argue is maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think this is applicable here it as\nWell absolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlet [laughter] can know wouldn't want it to them or nobody wanted the story and I'm like how can this not be possible but this isn't the first time this happened to me same thing with David ... the critical keep her from Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated\nAnd and and it's ongoing they ... the\nUh the u._s. implicated in a very brutal rape case\nA sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nBut also we we should also be clear though that that he that that were NATO has responded and denying these allegations right\nWell of course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Katherine my or a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars in NDA like let's not forget that that happened and she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nDo Spiegel would not and this is something we have to address when we talk about media would not have printed that saved ... and ... and legal has gone over this a hundred times if Christie honor and all those team was going to sue ... would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nWell I Know you're right and it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world and other issues I'm I'm

New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal court thanks to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year\nAs a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail to be moved out by today\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western ... offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nTo speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nThan he covers urban affairs here at our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tens enough to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right you're right that's correct so said this\nLaw will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and that they're phasing it in so this is the start of the law said this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been especially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm it's the case involves sexual assault if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that than the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that ... the sixteen and Seventeen year old to have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so it's a day to day and what's happening yes that's true too so\nAnother thing to mention is that this law is not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a free or national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country um it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you are there um that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything\nUm your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds that were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go\nSo they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx and so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\nSo there's ... there's been said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em an Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them in the head repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement um and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island\nI'm In addition to that we have this young man named ... who is in Rikers in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed but he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on Pete his family couldn't meet the three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer Gunderman from the New Yorker it got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that is sort of the backdrop of where we are today\nThere's been lots of talk particularly from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan\nStreaming up New England public radio was funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay road opens six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nOr it's where all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly how does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop into about five thousand so um [noise]\nThis is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mention that to move people off the jails is to close down Rikers island's going to be controversial said the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up\nNew jails in ... I'm so these would be burrow based shows that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been tremendous opposition so far\nWhat about you mentioned clique prouder and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people in and out\n[noise] um right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which um seems like it won't happen\nThere is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis mass and bailout that's being planned\nBy the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and said that\nUm math bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people um they were trying to raise five million dollars and the bailouts are supposed to happen through out the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see\nSome of these people being bailed out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids every part of the planning process has been guided by this principle [noise]\nCity Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you ...\nComment for this show up on our Facebook page sweetest ... or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight my take\nYour ideas on tanks are a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about this is the takeaway [noise]\n\nThe the PR news network is funded by you and celebrate Holyoke a local music festival in downtown Holyoke featuring music food at art open to all this Friday through Sunday celebrate Holyoke mass dot com\nAnd by the blue heroin restaurant and catering offering full service catering out the restaurant on Sunderland and throughout western Massachusetts blue heron dining dot com slash catering\nHave David Draine here with NPR now while we're covering national and international news here cherry Philly is interviewing statehouse reporter every Monday to keep you up on the latest news from Boston\nKaren brown digs into health care policy and Health News and Adam ... covers the Berkshires New England public radio brings you the latest from your own area give to New England public radio news coverage like that can continue just go to any P.
