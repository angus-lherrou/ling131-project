know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to distinguish what's the worst and what's\nThe most threat they're all threatened and they're all bad because they all kill

and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't on the news is in terms of the violence unprecedented but in terms of the mood that both you and Bertie of described\nAn absolute there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely erode\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag down a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant\nIn this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical you try to lump lights the premises violence and with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacists terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because a number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who are trying to vote part of the problem of lumping\nWhite supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacy is terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream\nStake in the politics a lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacist terrorists are not far removed from the views that are being espoused by the geo pie and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as as loud as Islamic terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society of America is not\nA majority Muslim nation however the ideology of white supremacy is very much in the mainstream of America now of course we have ... we had made a lot of progress from where we were in the past but she discussed what is happening now\nIn a way that discounts\nThe centuries and generations of this type of violence that we have seen in this country again I just I don't see the value and doing that\nBruce I Want to bring in I'm just really quickly here we know that law enforcement focuses on social media profiles our law enforcement focusing on far right extremists [noise] what\nLaw enforcement to to my knowledge is certainly follow federal law enforcement in particular are certainly following this and certainly concerned about it and understand completely that social media has led to\nThe you know preventing not just of the courses most extreme most odious conspiracy theories and ... towards tape but also served as a rallying cry for people who might have been isolated voices in the past and had no traction and their views\nTo inspire and motivate and ultimately\nI debate or provoke others to engage in violence so I think something that's taken incredibly seriously the question is what the host of those social media sites what they're also doing\nTo police what's put on their sites and that I think until very recently has been something that was a vacuum at essence very little was done an obviously much more needs to be\nAnd breed just to to round up the conversation here we know that far right wing extremism as you've mentioned in white supremacist violence has lasted for has existed in this country for a very long time I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how this is a reflected in almost in in white male rage in many ways\nI think that's definitely a component of it I think that our society socialize is some of us to have the expectation of having less rights I'm less access less ability to things I think that we need to

deciding more than just which party comes out ahead in this election cycle\nThe winners of the mid term have the power to shape our democracy through congressional redistricting that means the redrawing of the electoral map that happens every ten years and it's part of the reason why we're seeing so much outside spending on political campaigns not just federally but also at the state level\nHere to explain Morris Denise Ross barber she's the managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise welcome to the takeaway\nThank you for having me so can you tell us briefly and hopefully clearly how does redistricting work so after the\nTwenty twenty census is conducted states have to revisit their state legislative and congressional district boundaries and redraw them where needed what are they looking for in terms of redistricting\nDo where the populations are and if new lines need to be drawn or new congressional district need to be established based on\nThe population numbers so for example in Montana we currently have one congressional district and that may have to get rearranged into two and then uh consequently another state would have to lose their district\nI mean there's only certain number of house members in Congress so you can't just keep adding to the number of the congressional members so they just get re arrange but mostly\nJust the lines get drawn with regards to who didn't what district that's primarily what happens and if you're a state legislator for example you may remain that state legislator but your district boundaries change\nAnd what kind of a role is redistricting playing in our upcoming midterm elections\nIn the vast majority of states the governor and the legislature hold the redistricting pens after the census that means that currently twenty nine governors and more than eight hundred state legislators who are in this year's\nBallot could have a hand in drawing the new maps so it's a fairly important process that takes place every ten years or you know a lot of players involved and who is going to be controlling Congress to governors and senators who will be elected in twenty eight team\nBecause they won't be up and twenty twenty so they will be holding redistricting pens\nSo looking at the money that's being spent on political campaigns what are you seeing we just talked about how much money is flowing into political ads I'm coming from superPACs coming from the campaigns themselves individual donors why are you seeing as far as money is concern\nIn addition to the fact that the U.S house is at play in terms of flipping from Republican to Democrat [noise]\nThis is a very serious and major election at the state level because most states hold their big races during the non presidential years so we have thirty six gubernatorial races on the ballot twenty of which are at play and according to ... ... there are twelve state Senate chambers that could flip\nBased on the upcoming election so\nThere is a group called the national democratic redistricting committee which is currently run by Eric Holder who also was one of the recipients of a recent bomb threat\nUm and his group to NPR see has given directly to state candidates and political parties almost six hundred thousand dollars for example they gave two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the Pennsylvania democratic governor a candidate Thomas Wolfe\nThey've given another two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the Georgia Democratic Party\nThey've given thirty six thousand to Wisconsin state parties and they also gay fifty thousand dollars and supportive of Ohio redistricting\nMeasure and this is just money that is going directly to these candidates and the campaigns we don't yet have data on how much money these entities and others are spending independently on state races\nI mean you said it's hard to tell how much money they're spending independently are we able to find out who's\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nWho is giving directly to the candidates and depending on the state laws we know the groups who are spending we may not always know however you know who's funding those groups and that's the dark money problem that both races at the state and federal level are confronted with\nWe've seen this in the past and twenty ten how did Republicans what was the Republican strategy back in twenty ten and how effective was that for them in terms of redistricting\nWell I mean they obviously took clear control of the vast majority of chambers of the state legislatures throughout the country they targeted specific races in order to do so they identified which chambers were most vulnerable and which seats within those chambers were most\nVulnerable and really spent money and they were very successful the Republicans had a majority in almost all of the chamber's across the country or in at least a vast majority of the state legislative chambers many congressional seats also swung Republican\nAnd I'm Wondering how much do you think constituents really know about what their state legislatures do the power that they have do you think voters really understand the issues of redistricting\nNot at all no okay so if they don't why not I mean this seems to be so critical it's a critical use of our census that's a critical thing for those of us who want to get out and vote and who were voting for why do you think this issue is so over luck or misunderstood or not understood it all\nRight I I think because most people are just trying to get through their day in their year and they're worried more about their health insurance and whether or not they have a job and you know who draws a redistricting boundaries has kind of politically ... [laughter]\nThe whole process involves just a lot of gene mapping and and it's really\nA game that's played primarily by the insiders are the political parties the people who are going to the polls and and the voters who are\nPaying attention are paying attention to redistricting but certainly the major political parties and and their allies and these groups like the Indy RC are very aware of it\nDenise Ross barber is managing director of the national Institute on money in politics Denise thanks for being with us thank you very much [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nThey take away is supported by huge originals on roadside attraction presenting ... starring Susan around and as a mother struggling to free her captured journalist son also ... in theaters friday\nAnd babble European made language learning program bubbled teachers practical conversation image Toyota Russia Swedish and other languages available maps or or online at B.
