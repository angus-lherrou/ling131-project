lot of us who knew him over the years was that he was well connected to the government he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior officials so for us we knew him that way and then lately she'd taken up a\nPoster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away from Saudi Arabia and basically set up in self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and the side as we see clearly now with his fate\nAnd you've been speaking just sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new developments here\nSo we've been following the day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the that the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from signs from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public that clearly\nGiving it to John honest to publish that those two groups of Saturday's that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the consulate he never came out from that meeting\nOn to the second over a week ago and\nThese officials that came flew in on private planes and left the same day I'm usually the Saudi officials are Turkish officials Saudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in in in a different times that day and they left\nThe same day and the Turkish officials are saying they were essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing of it so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation they're asking the access to the ... to it which of course is diplomatic ... so that are also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid details in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment we know they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy or consulate building putting them in the cold [noise]\nUm we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um there's even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all in the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the Turks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so\nEverybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based has been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportantly a more and
