every now and then but are the Proud Boys unique\nI think they're a part of our shifting culture ... and ... what I mean by that is that\nTo say white supremacy in our most recent past was to a

culture and anybody wants to join that is welcome to join us including these men of color who are sort of also very much in amateur the idea of white and it says a status and also the key a binary here is it anti blackness is a key feature of their platform\nSo let's talk I was going to ask you what the driving forces particularly for men of color who want to engage in this is it racism is it ...\nIt both [laughter] it is both I mean talk about a parody medic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both the jet anti gender bias and race bias or either the the ways in which this is I guess you know you would say very toxic white masculinity\nAnd men of color are no exception to set of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up there and being part of a the idea of a\n... call it western or you know supremacy western culture and and the western civilization that they say oh white men were part of creating a I I think that that is something uh that\nIs a marketable package of ideas that's very easy to sell unfortunately is it becoming more is it becoming easier to sell in this current climate and David I Want to ask you that will will when we come back from a break I'm Tania [noise]\nIt is most definitely easier to sell because it combined both a quote of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\n[noise] I'm just curious how it is that people of color um who are not by definition white Kennan gauge with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate this idea of waiting is as culture from racism and any anti blackness has also reduce the idea of oh it's not about blackness it's about bad black culture\n[noise] David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise] well\nIn some ways it's actually very old I mean you know started during this when I was covering Miriam nations in Idaho in the late seventies early eighties\nAnd day to claim that they were only for
