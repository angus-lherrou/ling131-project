D. three Amherst\nW. N. N. you eighty nine five great Barrington WNBA nine Ninety eight nine Adams W. A. I. C. Ninety One nine Springfield and W. A. M. H. eighty nine three Amherst\nFrom NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nUnder the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the notion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that tie fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning Steve thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just step back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and\nAbout the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kevin gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nLists whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man\nThat is being replaced and that will kill to court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes\nMainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way to the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win\nAnd they may\nMove on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to and to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow and it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be don't do it\nEven this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nThat example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes\nOne of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska another one being Susan Collins of Maine\nWho issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that you spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to ... to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do a leader of what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works right Ron Elving\nIs but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why and I met on why would she do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and at the end of that we should\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and say that the university graduate schools MS and applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at ...\nYou know but I think he should have that final vote on the floor she has not said that let's be no he did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually\nWell who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure on her and she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the\nRules were different when that sort of thing would happen you'd get sixty votes for cloture then maybe only fifty two votes to pass\nIn there you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska was a no vote at least on cloture\nSusan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about the nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict\nOf the mob and the media would wet out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the files or\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now more lazy as executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly mile\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news of the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch as you guys have been talking about that she was actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise] uh she was in college\nA while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he just starts about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\n... what we think will be just as a cabin on\nBill ... thanks for taking the time I

I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we had been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end debate\nAnd then the vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do vote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine\nHas specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance denomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nBut the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominees even before there were allegations of sexual assault and then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break in Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine Blasey Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh has a friend looked on and perhaps participated\nWhile they were all in high school in the Nineteen eighties so fifty one to forty nine years the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican months' NARAL can start us off he is in the segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate [laughter] you know the the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allowed I last well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she is a very well known names and yeah and not as many people\nAs a you know some of the other states so she was able to pull that off my point about that is that she doesn't all Republican leadership anything so when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profiling courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought could be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nAh because of the politics of either their Koch is a with a colon\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nSomebody was higher than stay well let me last time going that I'm not a fix what's her job and I mean that not at a Democrat or pro democratic thing I mean that as somebody who would book do with their voting rights go against their base so when you think about um what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on\nCloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor leader when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nThese three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mentioned\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and it wouldn't be All right still be fifty votes would be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor but protesters\nOutside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake and an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward [noise]\n\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the\nExcruciating conflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories so we have the broad issue\nAnd then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure the judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't it a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing\nFor somebody to be promoted to the highest court in the land and there there is a difference and and there was a moment today of\nThe bitter is to pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when\nUm minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick\nGarland and of course right after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell says Mitch McConnell showed editor said\nWe're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with the just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject in his own caucus and made that happened and never bad it is an island and and and Obama had thought he was doing a I'm a\nReasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick the victim Oscar he picked a moderate liberal uh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nFields of reverberations that still even though it was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listened to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also a on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick your starting point if you say that one side that something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened in Nineteen\nRyan answers that I've just had which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take them out or you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and so now that the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way no it depends on what what are beginning point you want to want the set for when the story started to go wrong\nYes there are some similarities here and for Republicans the years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan did the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd will continue covering the train crash whenever and wherever it might happen you are listening to special coverage of the cabinet vote from NPR

debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility but Susan Collins could change your vote when the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final\nAnswer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what what evidence do we have to go on to the way she's leaving will\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters a and there is a possibility that people vote differently for a cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nIs she's already done it this Congress she did it on the nomination of Betsy device for education secretary in fact\nShe wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently in the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the ... and ... tensions [laughter] there's your health committee yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but send that she still had concerns about\nHow ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against um\nDevice and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney has it come down and break the tie on a package of\nTax just a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and you may choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... executive vice president for policy at the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ms ...\n... so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's bipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh\nI think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct and I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but that's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct\nBrought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nIt's yeah it's just not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican uh out of fifty one who\nVoted no this has been a very very partisan vote in ... equally partisan on the Democratic side of the not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nI usually people I Want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this side of the nominees fitness to serve on our highest court so I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how\nStreaming of New England public radio is ... Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early\nJuly I'm an ... you you were a\nSenior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christie English is\nBoth [laughter] so at ... and and Dianne Feinstein I said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone it it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's\nIn retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as she handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public and I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable\nBut other people think it is less admirable but you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you were a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story how do you\nThink about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention it to someone so then it could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or\nTo the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could\n... you know share it with other members and still preserve confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserved confidentiality so I view it as Senator Feinstein really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention in the confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it\nThere are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who ah have possession of a letter we don't know who else might have been told and in what way both in the end\nIt leaked do you believe it all to mostly\nHad to lick was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated I'm Better at an individual who didn't want to go on the record\nI don't know who leaked it but I think that\nWhat this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week as there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone or who will suddenly confessed to a senator they're interrupting in in an elevator\nI think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault and there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good and I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter at a campaign rally sense exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere\nThat they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nYou know let me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julio y'all through she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she just\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "05"}
