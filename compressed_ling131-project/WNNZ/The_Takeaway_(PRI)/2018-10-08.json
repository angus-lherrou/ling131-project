Texas the small\nPoor border town depends on its relationship with all he not Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande the town would also be directly impacted by the president's proposed border wall\nYou know there's a lot of Kelly\nThere are some places that how can you find that um I mean living here it's quiet and they say\nThey love and all is here to tell us all about this he's the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its new six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with your tempting so what is ... Texas like ...\nOf your Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nAnd the reporters who hotter Hussein who's spent some time this summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on its cross border sister town in Mexico ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on oh you knock off for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there's such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there

living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty or not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a a border wall they don't want the wall at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going in ... in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks in ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise]\nPoverty but it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health on a very odd twist it in the story is that if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere's only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be a matter of fact two at Texas a city that\nAre in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by cars so as a result of people feel very isolated they feel that\nA Washington and the federal government in a way is not heating their concerns this was a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and I even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there is certainly a other\n... and daily necessities might be there too so health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fed keeping your family fed and making sure that\nThat you have the basics of of daily life this was a really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nOn also seems to again also fly in there and the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities you know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country\nUm and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why you chose the places you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market\nIs at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well must underscore that but there are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that\nThey are struggling and might be an issue of education we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell a\nIncredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where\nHousing is such an issue on

gone to sex but a representative of\nMany other places throughout the country whether it's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what to what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWhen we've got about a minute left and

identity [noise]\nI'm from Detroit I was born and raised there my husband's from Detroit and my family lives there and so for me Detroit as personal it's about family I always say that Detroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are\nLooking at the city were sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a a narrative around race in economics and our nation and so for me it's important to be writing about that in writing from a place of within a I\nSo much love for the city because I have so much family there and and I have such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that tell us more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um it's something that's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic well\nFor a while I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I've spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or to teaching because of that it's a public school teachers and private with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from\nReally many angles and so my play pipeline is about looking at it through a mother who's trying to write her son but also a mother who's a teacher in a public school so we get to see her relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at\nBasically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and their emotion out of the as young especially young black and brown boys and our nation\nAnd so that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who was putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now\nAs opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportunities that women of color specifically have within a the creative fields\nTell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at ... university graduate schools MS in

you have to change in leadership and we're seeing that evidence and large and small ways and our nation right now right leadership it comes from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse backgrounds and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they're making those decisions that so I think we need to see a shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just wanted to stay off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world while I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift that invites audiences\nOf diverse backgrounds into the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nIn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there is an assumption about what people of color will not spend that money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant it's false\nI think it is also it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what theater had and figure it out but I Do also think\nAffordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed and theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house where I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food to come see your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money if it comes to each of food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to move me give me some samples bring me out and show me that I'm\nNot just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship with that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active\nDominique Laurie so as a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you so much so many thank you\nLet's take away
