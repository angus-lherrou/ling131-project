should honor indigenous people with my own indigenous language [noise] thank you um\nSome talk start talking about or capitalism by talking about the colonial food regime and I think good place to start talking about the colonial food regime is with the Irish famine\n[noise] um because I I Wish famine really encapsulates or what the food system has been about ever since the dawn of capitalism let me just read from here from my book\nIt doesn't matter if the food is fresh organic uh rubella or a Big Mac\nPass from the highlands of Ethiopia or cheese whiz from Walmart doesn't matter whether you need it or not whether it's good or bad for your where it's locally produced or travel from afar whether it was corral cage free range or let a happy life\nIf enough people wanted and have the money to buy it someone will turn it into a commodity\nAnd sell it so that is the basis of our food system as a\nSystem and when the commodity system was introduced to the world during the ... that's just a revolution and not only changed the forces of production it changed the relations of production\nAnd millions and millions of people were uprooted from their lives from their villages 'em and driven a out of their social relations and out of their productive relations into capitalist\nRelations into the factories ... panic meals um and many starved or even though there was plenty of food the Irish potato famine it's really a misnomer there was plenty of food in Ireland uh during the famine people were just too poor to buy it\nIn fact there was one of the golden age of a\nEnglish or agriculture high farming and\nUm but people had been separated from their means of production and we're no longer able to feed themselves and were flocking into the satanic meals a day to look for work where they were literally worked to death that is the introduction of capitalism that the introduction of what we call the colonial food regime [noise]\nNow this was a great concern\nTo great thinkers at the time and I'll just mention to have something to do with co ops in John Stuart mill who is a very important reformer and who believed in a co-op cooperative isn't um as a way of helping people to respond\nTo what capitalism was doing to their society\nUm and of course Robert going or who was a utopian thinker also very much in favor of co ops end of a a planned communities um but\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses on farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOr the ... can the capitalist system that was being imposed on Western Europe at the time particularly British Isles\nBut he wanted something different he really wanted something radical he wanted to pull out of the capitalist system any also want to co ops to help do this so we begin to see that cooperatives or tools and different responses to capitalism\nVery few people today actually know what John Stuart mill or rubber on and said we don't really studied them much\nOwing and crew or the philosophers and and the sort of the wealthy people who were pushing back against capitalism at the time\nBelong to a very elite level of society and they sort of launched these ideas in what we call the public sphere were there was all this debate and the coffee houses in London about oh dear oh dear what shall we do about capitalism after all\nBut in fact there was another public sphere where people were discussing what the hell to do about capitalism how the hell to stay alive working Eighteen hours a day and not getting enough and literally being worried to death\nAnd of course those were the partisans who had been these skilled and displaced by the industrial revolution\nAnd whose work had been devalued because of this enormous what they call reserve ... an army of labor starving people willing to work for nothing in order to survive and so you see this response\nFrom the co opt for survival resistance survival but more than that because when people get together and once they can eat they begin to talk\nAnd then they got to talk about a lot of things they begin to talk about suffrage they begin to talk about abolition of slavery they began to talk about changing governments they begin to talk about democracy they get to talk about how to change the world so they can see cops being a as a place with the public sphere\nAnd governments are forced to push presidents of land and so basically the industrial revolution has played out again\nIn the third world you tremendous um disruption\nOf peasants societies and they flock to the urban centers looking for work and you get what Mike Davis cause a planet of slums well did he shouldn't everybody

Greenfield and shelter and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAre good and then no one can pay back their loans well in this country in the seventies we lost half of our farmers they went bankrupt the farm crisis in the third world we get the third world debt crisis\nAnd so the world bank steps in and the international Monetary Fund steps and says you know you've got to keep up your payments\nIn the United states you could just you know repossessed the farm but you can't exactly repossessed Mexico\nAnd so the world bank steps in and says you've got to keep up your payments [noise] um well alone you the money sitting up your payments this is public money this is our money by the way the world bank is a public institution that's our money\nSo public money was used to learn to farm to governments in the global south to keep up their payments to private banks in the north\nBut you've got to sign on the dotted line with this guy over here was always a guy and he was from the IMF and the IMF said there was a little thing would cost structural adjustment we'll give\nYou the money but you have to promise to remove all your tariff barriers dismantle all your marketing boards um get rid of of all your or um food crops don't worry about food will grow it in the north dismantle although if you're a grain reserves\nAnd um started growing things more coffee and flowers these things will to get your dollars so you can\nPay back the banks this is called Neal liberalism you have to privatize all of your state services privatize all of your state run industries put them up on the market will come down will buy them thank you very much\nSo what's happening to us today in the United states happened first\nAnd the third world the privatization of Arctic of education already happened in the third world privatization upcoming privatization of uh the post office or to help in the ...\nThird world I'm so privatization is basically this new wave of capitalism I'm which we now call Neal liberalism\nAnd complete deregulation from Minneapolis environmental deregulation um labor deregulation trade deregulation that's with the world Trade Organization is about and we have this this rush of free trade\nThe free trade mania World Trade organization and the free trade agreements of the north American free trade alliance and Central American free trade\nAgreements and you get tremendous over production the north they dumping in this in the south or putting farmers out of business within the year the signing of NAFTA over a million Mexican farmers went bankrupt and why do you think we have so many immigrants here\nToday is because these arrangements these agreements\nThese capitalist agreements destroyed their livelihoods that's why you're here and you look at who's\nWho's uh in the back of the house or the fancy restaurants former farmers whose cutting the launch those are farmers who is doing all the farm work all the stupid labor those were farmers so when farmers in this country say oh geez who's gonna you know all the farmers are disappearing\nNo there's no no one wants to farm anymore and they're surrounded by foreigners that just happened to be brown so what it costs doing well in the postwar period cops kind of you know languished\nBut then they begin to get what I learned was another um second when called the second wave of clubs and you get these co ops by fairly privileged people who decide to reject this corporate food regime\nThey want to live differently they want healthy food they want food which is recognizable and they organize and they push back\nAll of these instances of people pushing back is with carpal on your call the counter movement the counter movement it's a social movement of people who do not accept what capitalism is doing to them and they push back out of necessity\n[noise] we had so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that\nAnd I like to think that the second wave was really part of the beginning of what we today we call the food movement\n... but the food movement has many roots\nAnd one of the roots is the food justice movement in the food justice movement comes out of the traditions of African Americans comes out of the needs of Mexican Americans\nComes out of the desires of Asian Americans people with a very different position and the food system but who find different ways of ensuring their own food security out of necessity\nAnd so today we haven't really a thriving food movement we talk about all the time Michael Pollan Alice Waters all these people talk about the food movement\nRaj Patel ... pay me um and I think we have to sort of cop to the fact that\nThe food was one of the reasons the food movement in here not just because we're rejecting\nA processed food which we should it's pretty bad for us as everybody knows where we're also trying to deal with the contradiction that the richest country in the world produces more food than any other country except maybe China I'm\nIn this country when people want is seven people are going hungry\nWe don't call it hunger recalls prudent security measure special way of measuring it might not [noise] um if you call it hunger you won't get us the grounds and I'm sure you have to call it fruit and security\n\nBut one in seven people in this country so that tells you right away that hunger is not the result of scarcity\nWhy are people going hungry and the richest country in the world with more food than anybody else because they can't afford it and so hungry maps very closely with poverty\nHunger also maps very closely in this country with race so the highest levels of food insecurity in this country are among people of color we have a racialized food system\nAnd this is one reason we have a strong food justice movement to deal precisely with this kind of inequity\nNow it turns out that the figure I just gave you one in seven hungry people in the United states reflects perfectly how many hungry people that are in the world about one in seven people\nAre going hungry in the world in fact depending how you measure it it might be much greater\nBut by the standard um a means of measurements from the uh United Nations\nOr one in seven people are going hungry now you're a lot about from Bill Gates and others that we have to go to Africa and we have to say Africa from Hungary we need to take the new green revolution to Africa and Africa Africa Africa are you guys are interested in Africa\nAll of a sudden oh well African never got a chance to for the green revolution it's not true actually remember Lucian failed in Africa but in fact that if you really want to end hunger that's not where most of the hungry people are most of the hungry people are in Asia and Pacific\nWhy aren't we talking about that\nBecause they already had a green revolution and Asia and Pacific\nThat's why so the green revolution isn't just about expensive inputs\nAbout fertilizers and hybrid seeds and pesticide smelling the green revolution is about\nExchanging one food system for another\nExchanging peasant food systems for capitalist food systems and sell logically and historically as it always has it displaces and this disasters millions of people and drives them into the ranks of the hungry is why producing more food the way we produce food in the industrial food system\nIs never going to solve hunger\n\nIn two thousand\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield and shelter and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nThis and we also had record hunger around the world um we'd never produced so much food as we did during those food crises and there were food riots around the world during this time you might remember there are food rice in this country\nWas put right in Milwaukee I mean there are still writes in places where you would expect them like in sub Saharan Africa or I'm In Haiti where people were eating my biscuits to survive better in Milwaukee\nWasn't 'cause there wasn't enough food is because people couldn't afford it but meanwhile ATM Monsanto Cargill general foods Safeway or Walmart or making record profits at the height of the food crisis\nStarted with farmers in started with the food programs so what we need is a strong counter movements why didn't we get reforms that will ask market crash they've all the money to to the banks bailed out the banks what about the people\nBecause the counter movement was not strong enough\nSo what is it can be done brothers and sisters to take a look at things\nWe've got about two million farmers we have more people in jail and then we have on the land\nWe have less than a million agricultural workers forty six thousand people working in processing plants but three million working in retail grocery sector you put all these together that's a fifth of our national workforce\n\nNow that's interesting from an organizers point of view from a disruptor his point of view from a reformist point of view from a revolutionary point of view twelve percent you can shut things now which represent\n... percent is all the globe the in 'em all the corporate food regime controls globally they controlled ... percent of the food and with that they control the world's food systems\n\nNow co op don't control much of the food in this country I Know\nAnd farmers are too weak to demand anything but people who work in retail grocery that's the biggest employer in this country Walmart speakers important is country\nWhat if we were to converge in all of our diversity how powerful\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield and shelter and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nThrough movement as far as we're concerned is the food movement it has a progressive wing and has a very radical wing and the corporate food regime has two wings one neo liberal in one reformist\nAnd if the counter movement expects to introduce any reforms much less transformative reforms it'll have to converge the progressive gin radicals are gonna have to converge\nThink about the different types of co ops that I described they're all represented here\nBut which ones should come together my position is it the progressive in the radicals need to come together because if the reformists from the progress it's come together than to counter movement split down its back and it becomes a week thing and it will never be able to introduce changes\nThe reformist wondering is any change there too weak why because the neo liberal or hedge demonic this is the age of neo liberalism what's keeping us from coming together\nI Would you say there are some historical obstacles we need to deal with\nOne with the sexism and now there would be racism and another would be clashes and\nWe have to deal with these things brothers and sisters we have to take them head on we have\nTo be fearless we have\nTo call it out I have to call out my privilege as a white male and I have to allow people to call it up right here right now everywhere we've\nGot to dismantle patriarchy we've got to dismantle racism this is an extra work this is the work because\n[noise]\nBecause if we don't dismantle what is keeping us apart we will never come together and if we don't come together\nWe will not change this thank you very much [noise]\nI was just a curious you have there are three million grocery workers you know of is this statistic of service and restaurant workers that we could add in there as part of the food oh\nYes I Do but I Can't remember it [laughter] yes and there are some excellent organizations like the restaurant opportunities center that organized restaurant workers\nUm by the by restaurant workers out some of the highest levels of food insecurity in the nation and the highest within that sector or in the fancy restaurants\nI have a question about the inconsistency that me and my friends discuss brought many systems but the people in this room will respect from say about this one so we have an eleven thousand members that are small cooperative upstate New York\nIt occurs to me that those eleven thousand members although they raised their hand to say they want to be part of this shift in food systems\nTherefore one case their retirement plans their stocks and their bank investments are at the same time more than likely supporting the structures that you discuss\nRight we realize is in our school board work in my community that the people were coming to us demanding security in front of the school buildings had not check there all the cows to see whether or not they were supporting Remington\nRight so how do we begin to expand this conversation so we stop eating the tale of our own snake\nWell thank you that's not a simple question is if [noise]\nI think I I really do believe that that\nReflective

entered the contradictions in our society and to the violence than we experienced in our society as we understand the structures behind that and called him out I think it deep personalize things enough so then we can begin to address the very personal issues as well\nAnd I think that you know there's a lot of trauma trauma um built into all of this\nSo we can't just address it intellectually you can't just addressed it organization like every one of us has to do some work whether it's about internalized oppression or whether it's about the guilt of privilege\nWe can't get anywhere if we're if we have these hangers on us which means we do have to do the internal work the good news is you don't have to do it alone in fact you can't do it alone\nAnd the good news is that there are tools for this\nIf you look at ... Native American communities today they have developed all kinds of ways of dealing with the trauma of genocide in constant constant work on genocide\nThere are excellent forums and workshops and um for dealing with\nRacism and how to dismantle racism\nFrom both sides of the oppressor and the press and the same is true for a sexism and patriarchy so I think that it to the extent that we can begin to bring these into our practice or social practice whether that's cooperatives or whether it's research like I Do\nThere's no guarantees on this you know we don't know what's going to happen\nWe don't know if we can avoid planetary collapse civilization will collapse the planet will go on\nWe want we don't know but what if we didn't even try what else are you going to do it's time to change everything were you busy\nSounds intimidating but what else I've been doing this stuff for a long time and very much for a position of privilege to meant trend tremendous mobility got educator I never thought I Would I mean I grew up as a farm worker but I'm the only one in my family because\nOf the way I look I'm that got a PHD I get depressed I got really depressed looking at these numbers\nAnd the only way I've been able to keep my spirits up is to align myself\nWith those who don't have that luxury those people for whom giving up hope is not an option we need to build these alliances and commit to them in fact they will save us all\nWhat do you think the potential power as of your story or some version of it for opening up constructive dialogue with a working class faction of the Trump coalition and um [noise] do you think that\nIt's worth energy or to invest in that direction and do you have any specific suggestions about that\nYeah I think we need to remember that there's a big faction of people who voted for Trump that voted for Obama", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Alternative Radio", "city": "Westfield", "day": "21"}
