is a very old were dating back to at least the thirteenth century that originally meaning a sacrifice consumed by fire or a burnt offering\nLeader around the fifteenth century it began taking on a more general and secular meaning specifically a great slaughter for sacrifice\nUs in the early sixteenth century the famous Spanish fryer told me to tell us costs us use the word Holocaust to describe the Spaniards ongoing destruction of a men's numbers of native people in the Caribbean and Latin America\nHolocaust also was used on various occasions from the sixteenth through the Eighteen centuries in reference to the massacres of Irish civilians by English soldiers and columnists\nAnd among other instances in the late Nineteen century the word Holocaust appeared in the New York times headlined above a story describing the slaughter of\nMore than five thousand Armenians in eastern turkey part of an ongoing mass killing campaign they're\nHolocaust again appeared repeatedly during World War two as a story and Peter Norfolk has observed in reference and I'm quoting over to the totality of destruction run by the axis nuts to the special faith of the Jews\nIn fact another points out only in the Nineteen sixties in the aftermath of the trial in Israel of the Nazi criminals out of like when did the English language publications begin referring to the Holocaust loosely translated reference to the Hebrew word Shaw\nLike most people I commonly refer in speaking and writing to the Holocaust with exclusive reference to the slaughter of six million Jews and the Nazis massive extermination campaign\nBut I don't believe it makes sense to expect the word Holocaust suddenly to disappear from the English language following World War two except with reference to the Nazi Judeo side\nBy the same logic we should be prohibited from using the word calamity except with reference to the Armenian Genocide or the nineteenth century Irish famine\nEach of which killed at least a million people in each of which has been designated in capital letters and in quotes the great calamity by their victims\nThe same logic would suggest that we strike the word devouring from everyday speech since that as the English translation of prime is to capitalize rama word for the genocide perpetrated against gypsies by the Nazis\nOther examples of genocide victims using a particular word to memorialize they're suffering of course about\nIt just doesn't make sense to banish or word from everyday usage because one group or another has adopted it in reference to their victimization\nAnd no doubt that's why my use of the word Holocaust not the Holocaust and referring to the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Americas actually was very little remarked upon much more controversial was my use of another word\nThat word was genocide\nOne of the reasons that became controversial is that by implying it was joining an ongoing debate about the uniqueness of the Holocaust\nNot talk about that debate the uniqueness debate shortly but first it's important to have some sense of why many people who knew nothing about that debate we're still instantly resistant to my use of the word the word genocide\nAmerican Holocaust was published on Columbus Day Nineteen Ninety two\nEarlier that same year Oxford University press also published a book\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by

Indians had been decimated by disease removal and conquest and now I had ignored them so she wrote I cried\nAnd then she returned to putting the final touches on her manuscript\nBut don't recount this story to be critical of Jane Tompkins but rather to suggest that her self confessed memory loss was representative and in some ways perhaps symbolic of the attitudes of most Americans and

government changed it to termination\nOr the denial of turkey over complicity in the Armenian Genocide or Japan over culpability for the so called rate of named king and on and on and on\nThere are various reasons and rationalizations behind such efforts to ignore or deny the existence of genocides or to systematically minimize their magnet to national pride and its flipside potential national

spirit of denial\nThat is the spirit of never forget\nThere was a wall in the United states Holocaust Memorial Museum inscribed warning something that'll Hitler reportedly said one day in Nineteen thirty nine on the eve of the Nazi invasion of poll and it's a famous phrase who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians\nMore ... than on this day I Believe nearly Seventy years later is another question\nWho after the crushing of Nazi Germany in Nineteen forty five could have imagined that the United states and Israel of all countries would help to perpetuate that convenient forgetful miss about the annihilation of the Armenians and with it\nHitler's murderous cynicism on into the twenty first century\nIndeed it was only a half dozen years ago that the current president of Israel Shimon Peres declared the Armenian Genocide Armenian Genocide to be historically meaningless\nThis prompted a particular the anger reply from within Israel by a man named Israel Charney the executive director of the Institute on the Holocaust and genocide in Jerusalem\nIn a letter to Paris Charney wrote the parents said quote gone beyond a moral boundaries that no juice should ever allowed himself to trust is adding that specific remarks on the Armenian Genocide being meaningless were comparable to denials of the Holocaust\nThis sort of statement is not unusual for Israel Charney\nFor many years he has ferociously fought back against the evil of Holocaust denial\nOne at the same time resisting efforts to set the Holocaust apart as in his words and I'm quoting him the ultimate of event against which all other tragedies of genocide a genocidal mass death already be tested and invariably found wanting\nFor me he writes the passion to exclude this or that mass killing from the University of genocide as well as the intense competition\nTo establish the exclusive superiority or unique form of any one genocide ends up creating a fetish just stick atmosphere in which the masses of bodies that are not to be qualified for the definition of genocide or dumped into a conceptual black hole where they are forgotten unquote\nWhich finally brings me back to the genocidal destruction of north and south America's native people\nAnd the strong resistance by some commentators to my use of the word genocide in describing the destruction\nCommentators like recently convicted felon Senator Ted Stevens who threatened to use his considerable power to cut off funding of the Smithsonian Institution if used the word genocide as a plan to do in a documentary film on the destruction of the Americas native people\nCommentators in short who would prefer that those millions of bodies remain buried and forgotten in Chinese conceptual black hole\nFor those of you

as a crime Lincoln was supposed to focus exclusively on did an ongoing extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany and this is incorrect\nRecent research and the Lincoln archives at New York's American Jewish Historical Society the New York public library and the Marcus Center of the American Jewish archives in Cincinnati\nHas revealed the existence of detailed manuscript ratings from the Nineteen forties and which Lincoln obviously preparing at least one book on John genocide probably more\nLeft numerous folders filed under what he regarded as a variety of genocidal events in history including the titles are his quote Spanish treatment of South American Indians North American Indians colon extermination\nHistory of genocide projected book on North American Indian research and much more\nIn uh Nineteen forty eight report to a foundation that was supporting his work Lincoln listed what he called ten specific genocide cases says phrase he used a which was compiling information and I called to be made available to the United nations drafting committee on genocide\nOne of those ten cases is labeled the Indians in Latin America another is the Indians in North America\nAnd then finally in the Nineteen fifties Lincoln's archives reveal still more folders bulging with information on these subjects including the draft of a one hundred page essay on genocide against Indians one that includes sections on their incarceration in what he calls concentration camps\nHe was of course referring to reservations\nBy the late Nineteen fifties Lincoln had almost completed a massive book on genocide in world history\nThe entire third section of which was to be given over to genocides and colonial settings with separate chapter titles listed on genocide against the American Indians Latin America\nGenocide against the as tax the Yucatan genocide against the Incas and then on to European genocides against the natives of New Zealand Australia south West Africa more\nBut in Nineteen fifty nine Lincoln died of a heart attack in a hotel room in New York City he was not yet sixty years old the book was unfinished\nBut even if it had been completed that probably never would have been published because by then a new orthodoxy was beginning to take hold in the United states and elsewhere when that view the Holocaust as a singular unique genocidal event in world history\nTo some proponents of this idea the Holocaust was not on the preeminent genocide it was the only genocide\nWhereas Lincoln apparently felt that acknowledging the suffering of others had no bearing on the recognition of one's own painful experience\nSome among this new generation regarded the Holocaust as moral capital to cite one representative writer moral capital that risk to being plundered by

destroying themselves and to me\nThat edging very close to blaming the victims of and ultimately they're not doing it to themselves even those who are committing suicide I think are not doing it to themselves again that's a fine point I think but in saying that what I'm really saying is that I agree with you\nUm that yes this has become a kind of machine that goes of itself in the same way that we can have deeply racist society without any overt\nEvidence of\nHate speech\nUm and and racial hatred apparent on the surface of the society because we've created institutions that that that that are are institutionally racist and simply take care of business on their own without without all the rhetoric that was associated with racism in the past so I agree with that\nI guess that's the distinction that I Would make 'em because I did conclude American Holocaust at the end of the nineteenth century although I did make references to um the killing in Latin America in the Nineteen horrible horrible genocidal killing Latin American the Nineteen eighties\nComes back to the question of the word genocide\nHistorians over the many years of trying to figure out some historians just tomato definitions of genocide and the reason they made up Jeff Sessions is because the genocide convention the United nations was cobbled together by a group of nations\nTo somehow make sense of ... to to institutionalize a law that would say this that we cannot have this any more this is illegal and nations must act against it so in order to do that they had to define it\nThe problem is who's sitting around defining this\nPeople who represent countries that in the past and at that time were committing genocide\nAnd when it was like having the thieves sit around the table right the writing the law\nSo for example a Lincoln had always had in his a definition of genocide whole groups of of political of people who would who were being exterminated because of their politics the Soviet Union had would have nothing to do with that\nBecause they had how many people in the gulag dogs at the moment that they're sitting down reading this this this genocide convention they simply could not have that as a result technically\nThe genocide in Cambodia was not genocide\nAnd there are very very few genocide scholars who will say that it was genocide\nBut most of the genocide scholars in the world today would say it was horrible but the victims were political victims and that's why it's not a genocide same thing with the killing of Indians and part of why\nThe the killers weren't able to extricate themselves by saying yes we kill all of those people almost exterminated an entire people\nBut it wasn't because of the fact that they were Indians which would have made them a protected group but because their political activities were such that we they deserved being exterminated and therefore yes maybe that was not very humanitarian and maybe it was a crime against humanity and so and so forth but it's not genocide\nAnyway that's one of the reasons why historians have tried many historians\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nOf genocide problem with that is\nYour definition includes this group by definition includes that group\nSuch as um taking children as the United nations convention those taking children away from families and putting them among others as a side but Australia most famously or insulin elders do hold so therefore then you've lost everything so\nI think that really what we need to do and I hate that I don't like us because I think the genocide convention as real problems\nIs that we just we have to hold the un genocide convention it's the only one the only thing that the definition that exists that most people bought into\nI guess what I'm saying to come back to your point which I think is a very good one is that I think we should stay within the un definition and fight about issues within that\nThan in the case then we have to accept the word intent however we define it as part of the justification for our use of the term genocide\nOkay this is my favorite ... like I think that I'm saying anything about the time but I I just want to say that I think that the intent\nTo Germany has seen are placed in a really large way by they tend to assimilate when I I'm not sure is all that\nLike if you look at the residential school policy I'm Katie and so I Know they're in school or a slower system in Canada a lot better but you look at the right in the residential school policy I'm not sure that you can pull apart the intend to exterminate what they intend to assimilate and that kind of example so\nYeah and actually ... the case can be made that the genocide convention does cover the and a lot of people have written about that in Canada and again in Australia particularly\nWell as as somebody who is Native American I'm\nChurch in the school basically my family all ran off during the movie\nAnd hit out I've lived on three different
