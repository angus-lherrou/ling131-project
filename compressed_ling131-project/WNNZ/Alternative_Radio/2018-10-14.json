let those will come after us and they try and if we are passing in front of the system we are complicit in what Emanuel conned would call radical even [noise]\nThat's Chris Hedges and this is the alternative radio I'm David by Sammy on this edition of a are features Chris Hedges on rise up and resist\nWomen isn't enough enough in the face of evil what does it take for people to move from passivity to active resistance\nThroughout history there have been instances of people they find tyranny fighting back no matter what the odds an example comes from Nazi Germany often considered the benchmark of evil opposition to the regime was highly dangerous\nSeventy five years ago hands and so the shore brother and sister and others at the University of Munich said good new enough they formed the white rose movement and cold down Germans to recognize their moral duty and overthrow the government\nThey disseminated critical information through flyers and graffiti\nOne such graffiti said whatever comes out of Hitler's mouth is ally\nIn Nineteen forty three times and so the show were arrested and beheaded their resistance and courage armored today they took risks can we\nOur guest today is Chris Hedges he's an award winning journalist to his reportage from the Balkans the middle east and Central America\nHe writes a weekly column for truth the dot com he's the author of many

of the warning signs that exist when empires disintegrate are flashing red\nAh the expansion of a military machine a that is Halloween the country out from the inside\nThe erosion of civil liberties the D. industrialization of our cities the capture of our political process by a tiny cabal in this case corporate that read directs all of the institutions\nThat once made reform possible towards the further consolidation of power a and amassing of obscene amounts of wealth\nThe political system no longer functions is at least in terms of\nPropel in a society forwarded its its role in that society backwards\nAs we enrich this tiny global financial elite and a which is largely orchestrated attacks boycott they pay little to no taxes remember Eisenhower or the wealthiest individuals and corporations paid Ninety One percent tax\nNow they have to extract that money from a beleaguered population\nThat's why you get programs not only of austerity but debt peonage a student at one point five trillion dollars\nHousehold debts over Thirteen trillion you're late on your credit card that's twenty eight percent interest\nOr you're going to poor communities and they're just fine to death for the most ridiculous offenses including an obstruction on pedestrian walkway is which means standing on a sidewalk not mowing your lawn which is actually a fine in Ferguson, Missouri because with the loss of tax revenue these counties and states\nCan't fill their budgets and because that\nOligarchy Gilead has rendered themselves untouchable\nA and we can watch massive acts of fraud by Goldman Sachs or banks and nobody's held accountable than the uh the system for its pound of flesh takes it out of the most vulnerable\nInstrument the symptom of something much deeper\nYeah Trump is a symptom of a political system that has seized up and doesn't work\nUh and that's why we're seeing Trump light figures appear\nThroughout the industrialized world Viktor Orban in Hungary a night or for Roger Boris Johnson in Britain you know the polish government just destroyed their legal system the sweetest elections just brought to power these are the right wing nationalist\nBecause in essence this global financial elite have seized control of national economy as we see it in Greece and it it the citizens have a lost the ability to determine both economic and political policy\nUh and so the debate has shifted in and Thatcher and Reagan were largely responsible for this it shifted\nA towards an assault on national identity um you know they're the idea that uh uh eleven million undocumented workers are somehow responsible for the economic decline of the United states is patently absurd um but it works when you have\nCorporations controlling your media platforms and there is no rational discussion of corporate capitalism or how it works a and as we move closer towards the financial crisis and one is coming another one\nUh you will see that kind of language and incitement to violence which Trump has already done be ratcheted up\nWhat are the signs of coming economic crash you mentioned that well\nWhat happened after two thousand and eight is that the banks and the global speculators received at virtually zero percent interest twenty six trillion dollars according to the University of Missouri\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add all

didn't build new factories create new jobs the way of traditional capitalist structure would what they did was hoard it\nBy back their own stock that's what they did with most of the money from the tax cuts because their compensation packages are tied that's why the overheated stock market the idea that that is somehow symbol of a healthy economy is absurd\nUh\nOr they invested it in very risky ventures like fracking so fracking the the the value of the fracking industry is determined not by their profits in fact it's a money losing operation almost all places\nAnd they've had to borrow a tremendous amounts of money over two hundred and eighty billion to keep it going\nBut the fracking industry has valued like the dot com industry on projected profits but at a certain moment that bubble burst ah estimates are that within a couple of decades forty percent of the the people who have student loans will have defaulted um the system's not sustainable\nNow what happens this time around is that the elites don't have a plan B they can't lower interest rates anymore they've already lowered them which is virtually zero I'm In fact central bank some central banks in Europe\nWere lending money at negative interest rates would pay to borrow money\nAnd\nThat flirt with what will be the death blow of the American empire and that is the day the dollar is no longer the world's reserve currency and why is that significant well because then the dollars value collapses completely I mean it's a fictitious value as it is\nA but it's it's held up because it is the world's reserve currency it's remains the world's reserve currency we saw\nYou mentioned Neil Postman he wrote a book in Nineteen eighty five calls amusing ourselves to death public discourse in the agents show business he writes\nWhen the population becomes distracted by trivia when cultural life is redefined ... rounds of entertainment when serious public conversation becomes a form of baby talk when

they're manufactured personalities there's no substance it's remember the old\nClashed or campaign between a Al Gore and Bush who do you want to have a beer with I mean this is insane\nBut it it is they're very skillful the public relations industry which was arguably one of the most evil industries in America and making us confuse how we are made to feel with knowledge\nAnd that manipulation now courtesy of handheld devices just goes on twenty four hours a day or and we are uh I think is\nA force to and wrote the probably the most illusions society in human history meanwhile we are being impoverished stripped of our civil liberties or have amassed\nAn oligarchy tick elite that you know rivals that that existed I mean I think is great interest in terms of income inequality is worse than what took place under the gilded age and you can't maintain a democracy in an oligarchy that isn't a particularly sophisticated\nPolitical thought Aristotle a\nElaborated on that to some three thousand years ago\nWho didn't Louis Brandeis the Supreme Court justice say you can have a you can have the two things you can have a democracy where you can have great concentrations of wealth that you can't have both\nRight and it Aristotle said that you know when you have that income inequality then you're only two choices are tyranny a revolution\nLet's go back to grab see again because you write in your book that he would have been spared of the divide in the United states between ... and you make a left and the working class\nWell\nSo I mean we had radical union movements the ... the old CIO the old United mine workers\nAnd that in\nThe name of anti communism or the red scare they were this rated especially in the Nineteen fifties after World War two and Alan ... written\nSome good books on this\nWhich were there was something she roaches a historian on that period that I didn't know I mean that that it didn't it wasn't just the Hollywood writers and Pete Seeger and dome trombone uh\nBut the FBI was going into high schools with lists of quote unquote reds with no evidence or and then these teachers were fired and blacklist they couldn't work again it really is at the all through the layers of society they were purging people with a social conscience critics of capitalism\nThe effects of that were quite devastating\nUm we saw a a rise of movements in the Nineteen sixties and then this contemporary ferocious assault\nA which began in the early seventies and Louis pals memo uh attack on the free enterprise system is kind of the blueprint for that Nineteen Seventy one Nineteen Seventy one and so\nFrom that point on word labor unions were decimated and we just saw with these so called right to work laws a further attack on unions only six percent now of\nThe American workforce in the private sector is unionized at all\nBut with the right to work law employers can't even make contracts with unions uh it it really expands the ability of employers to

G. I Want to draw a little bit on your studies of the Christian evangelical right in the United states you you wrote a book called American fashions in the Christian right in the war\nOn America large numbers of evangelical Christians in in this country are on nationalist and servants believers in capitalism eighty one percent of them voted in two thousand sixteen presidential election\nFor Donald Trump thrice married casino mogul who has a pension for men sitting in comports with porn stars and playboy bunnies how can we do that\nBecause they're cut from the same cloth with maybe this distinction or the white men who run most of these mega churches have sexual proclivities that are probably can't care than Trump um I find this whole question of how can the Christian right support Trump to be an utter misreading of the Christian right I spent two years with them [noise]\nBut who are convinced that it's five you can't the so you give up you walk away you don't give up\nI mean so you know it was interesting I mean even when after my book on the Christian right came out there were people I wrote about I'm In the book was called American Fascists but I wrote about the average person in the moment with great empathy because they're suffering was real and because I felt compassion for what they went through\nUm no I think it's economic I I think that if they're if they're social bonds are not recreate it and they're not really integrated into the economic and political system\nThan we can't reach them because to shatter their peculiar world view is to leave them out early bereft of any foundation by which they continue to exist\nAnd so I think we have to organize around for instance\nYou know raising the minimum wage to Fifteen or twenty dollars a we have to organize around universal healthcare we have to organize around issues that dramatically improve their lives are and that means building alliances with people in our communities whose\nPeculiar world views may be different and even repugnant to ours um but no I spent a lot of time with these people and ... you're just not going to our I mean the the whole I took a creation a seminar\nAnd so this was a class for a teachers and Christian schools how to teach creationism\nAnd they ... the instructor had to confront the fact that uh\nYou know the world is created when the first day of the lights not created till the fourth day so what do you tell the students will you tell the students the God created a temporary like I mean it's all in the details it's ridiculous it's not in the Bible it's completely fabricated but it shows you how disconnected their ideology is from\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you add all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOn a whole range of a public issues from a protecting environment to universal health care to having tuition free colleges and universities\nThese are all according to polls including one commissioned by the Koch brothers majority Terry in rye use yet the political class does not move forward on them why not\nBecause we don't count because we've all people know legislation we know statistically I mean legislation and laws are written by corporate lobbyists and we'd been utterly different power we've we live in West Sheldon will and called the system of inverted totalitarianism\nAnd by that he means it's not classical not yet\nNot classical ... I'm\nNot going to stop all and death camps\nWell and it's not a a Hitler Mussolini I mean I don't think Trump is reached that point\nSo you have the facade it's like the late Roman Republic you have the facade of the republic but internally corporations have seized all of the levers of power to render the citizen it but at a really it doesn't matter I mean it doesn't matter Kavanaugh commits\nPerjury I mean there's not no question he goes right on to the Supreme Court I mean it's remarkable uh the laws don't matter or at least for the rich ah and then you have\nA criminalization of poverty\nUh so you know mowing their lawn\nOr not mowing your lawn or standing on a sidewalk which means obstructing pedestrian traffic or or having an open container your find and jailed why because these county and state governments\nBecause nobody pays taxes and under eyes and how the wealthiest corporations and and uh individuals' paid Ninety One percent\nTax or they don't have any revenue so they're they can't get it from corporations because their\nImmune so you take it from the vulnerable so the pressure on the poor and the working poor is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse and there were powerless to do anything about it because the system whether it's the Democrats the Republicans the established elites\nAre beholden to corporate money\nGrump she used to say and it's often quoted by Edward ... and ... and others and saying that he had pessimism of the intellect and optimism of will uh is this something that appeals to\nYes because I mean people say well you know it's so bleak so depressing well it's bleak and depressing um and I think the greatest existential crisis of our time is to grasp what's before us from climate change alone\nI mean if we would stop all carbon emissions today which were not doing we would still suffer catastrophic climate change\nAnd one of the reasons that climate scientists are so terrified of going beyond two degrees Celsius in terms of global warming is that they know from study and other planets like Venus which once had water and now is eight hundred degrees that it triggers feedback loops which you can't control there's nothing you can do that\nAnd they've run mathematical scenarios on those loops that range from Seventy percent die off of the human species to complete extinction\nLots bleak and it's depressing um the seizure of our political system by corporate power global corporations are is depressing\nAh you know the fact that sixteen million hungry children go to bed in America every night is depressing as if the fact that we have to point three million prisoners twenty five percent of the world's prison population over half of whom were never charged with physically harming anyone is depressing\nAnd I think that we have to confront what's before us including our failed democracy\nAnd yet rise up and resist any way that it's a kind of moral imperative because we are
