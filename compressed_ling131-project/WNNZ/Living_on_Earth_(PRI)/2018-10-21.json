University Welcome back to living on earth Michael thank Steve it's good to be with you so why did hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it encountered warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees\nCelsius above pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or are we looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans of warmed up and it's an ocean heat waves and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the\nPlanet a hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet in some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these days\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast to has been somewhere between half a foot and a foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy in twenty twelve at a foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will be storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warmer in warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we seen this now so many times where a storm balloons from a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two\nAnd that only happens over very warm sees and are we getting more\nOf these very intense storms these category you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship for\nA category five storm you\nGet an increase of roughly seven percent\nIn the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes is the third power of the wind speed\nSo it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius above pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would have been in the absence of human caused warming\nYou know the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report\nIs saying that the the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal ever surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius above the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nSo for each you know half a degree Celsius it's the better part of one degree Fahrenheit\nRight there that's a Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storm\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius\nYou have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea
