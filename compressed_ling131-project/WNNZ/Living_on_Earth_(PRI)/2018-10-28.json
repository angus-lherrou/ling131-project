sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those whose diets contained more organics had about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancer as an older woman in a more than Seventy percent reduction in lymphoma is\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for more research when it comes to making food choices advocates say including the president of the environmental working group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here\nSo when this study came out it showed strong evidence in support of the long held belief that organic food is better for us how do you feel now that the study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting\nWhile they speculated about pesticides there are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings a certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacture\nThat in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst these are mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nThat is true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged food\nCompared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general playing a role here\nBecause there was a whale of a story\nWell how about we mark that cliche

trial of Minnesota judge abruptly acquitted them of all charges and they joined me though from Seattle, Washington welcome to living on earth thank you thank you very much Dave\nHow does it feel to have these felony charges thrown out on a\nI think we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling guilty with you know happiness that we are not going to jail and quite frankly that I'm off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I\nHad to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all of my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know the very well respected experts that we had lined up to testify it for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from NASA\nAnd build and Kevin so it's a mixed bag Emily\nYeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would've been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference\nSo they thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really have an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you could ask the judge to let you use the necessity defense\nAnd he had granted that to us back in October of twenty Seventeen and in fact he had copies of our expert witness list for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have\nConstrained us constrain the number witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seemed like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his\nWas the fact that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has a burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did you know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western ... offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nYeah from Seattle on climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter how articulate we had been\nIt wouldn't have had anything like the same impact as the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota\nSo you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope and we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry and they're um\nYeah when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge says in the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeds to go ahead to quit you of the charges\nRight that was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and local Enbridge employee\nAnd all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the log into the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that\nSo we were charged under a statute which was one of the sort of enhance penalties statutes that are being shoved through state legislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters\nAnd the statute we were charged under was the civically damage to pipeline and the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged a pipeline in any way\nYeah and ... century he was ruling that there wasn't evidence for reasonable jury to convict us basic right it as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage that pipeline right\nI'm going to sue to speculate about both of you in a a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case\nHow do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics sentiment the fossil fuel industry this is Emily in terms of\nYou know what kind of pressures he may have been under or what he may have been I'm thinking you know whether\nHis mind might have changed about what kind of precedent he wanted to that and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it's certainly something we've been wondering about he seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say\nAnd he wanted to let the jury hear it so you know the about face with quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThey fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do on and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent do do understand what do you do this direct
