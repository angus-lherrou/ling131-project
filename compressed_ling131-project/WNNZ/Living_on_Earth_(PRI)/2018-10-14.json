first\nTomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is from New England Public radio [noise]\n\nIt's living on Earth I'm CPR with\nHurricane Michael quickly blew up into a devastating category for storm as it entered warm waters in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico it's yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientist with the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael with only seemingly small increases in the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement called for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees will be beneficial but this new report finds that half degree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal was going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author Frye PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael\nGoing to be here again I mean to cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and uh if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering\nMessage apart and reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nThey are projected to worsen over time and the point at which the risks are related to climate change that is the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not toward the end of the century but very close to a matter of\nA decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nReport has an unusual origin the inter governmental panel on climate change producers thorough assessment of all our knowledge on climate change\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you land a western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nYour assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports and I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets the report that just came out is on the question of\nWhat is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high that we may just as a member of society is not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNot one of the headlines from this latest PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reach a net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nTo be Frank about it I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people and the report that frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has has put on it\nIs sort of like twelve years we don't do we should do the world comes to an end that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end costs that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually\nThat doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going to destroy some coastal societies particularly on small islands staged by they'll make life just miserable expensive and uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half century\nContrary to what most people think of the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organized to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what in fact do we need to do then as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nAt the most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means getting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nReducing end eventually eliminating our dependence on petroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and\nThe biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere that even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo here's a yet to any of your is offering a special treat sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets now in any PR that net [noise]\nLove one and a half degrees centigrade\nDoes just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was called for two thousand and Fifteen a lot of\nScientists were skeptical that they would be much of a difference in the impacts between one and a half two degrees\nBut because the government's call for the report in a lot of scientists went out and started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that they were big differences between one and a half and two degrees let me give me an example already by one and a half degrees there are places are particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year\nRule or all of\nIt is hard to figure out exactly where it's
