health\nSecretary Kerry welcome to living on earth happy to be here thank you so you know if there's one thing from your book every day as extra it is your love of the ocean why does the ocean called the in such a strong way while\nI'm a son of Massachusetts I think it costs to all of us sons and daughters we are a\nBlessed to be people at the sea here in the state of Massachusetts and we love Cape Cod we love the islands [noise]\nAnd I learned as a kid I was raised down on the edge you know around ... bay and I used to just clam and fish and play in the water or learn how to sail do all these wonderful things but I learned about under the water and I was a big Philippe Cousteau fan\nAnd just the two and my mother was an enormous conservationist environmentalist\nAnd I grew up with a sense of responsibility understanding that the ocean is fragile it's not impervious to the things we humans do it\nAnd it is I recall from your book in you're fortunate childhood you were on when they let's been islands you on the ... yeah you come out of Woods Hole and you can see it on your way to Martha's Vineyard if you like ... it's a great place to have your toes in the sand is yeah\nIt's uh but I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that\nEverywhere on our Cape uh people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes are low tides of the enormous beaches and the remarkable vision that President Kennedy had Dickey rate the Cape cod seashore national monuments so we're we're very lucky people and uh\nOur history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundred and Eighteen hundreds already sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchant efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state has cod wailing or and\nYou know we don't have ... now I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no God\nOr very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state\nSo what do we need to do today to take care of our oceans I think there are three primary challenges\nA number one\nClimate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean which has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shows and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate of impacts we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic\nImpact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution\nPeople build the building near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution\nView I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have high nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen and water and therefore the fish and plants and Fonda in the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today dead zones nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I seen film of a shark send or ... or whales dragon\nMore than ... any PR family last week thank you very much if you didn't get a chance to step up you can join any time they making a contribution at our website any PI dot net thank you very much\nWe have over fishing we have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we make cod anymore here\nEight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of the sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones\nAnd the others or at or near max so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi\nA with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and therefore appetite we have a huge challenge and already about Trump's at the protein that people get in the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fishes food stock and increasingly we're going to see pressure on that so those are the Big East but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think he spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about not to one there's something called the law the sea treaty\nWas something that the United states and folks from Massachusetts like Eliot Richardson worked on years ago which we've never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty um that would govern what is half of the world is not in any just to correct\nIt's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation but they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fisherman and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drift net fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned\nBut today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who go out with addressing it addressed net is literally thousands of miles of model filament netting that they dropped behind the boat drag allowing it kinda strip mines the ocean and as much as two thirds of the catch\nCertainly fifty percent is called ... they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine the division of a UC a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what address that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off and it becomes what we call the ghost in it\nBecause it just fishes on its own mind it's weighted down with carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic and an till it gets tangled in a way or tangled in the propellers of some boat\nIt's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark what chip so they're fishing\nSo we're over fishing talked to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nWe face a massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands I I just met with him the other day at an event in California where\nHe pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands and they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe there they'll lose their nation state which is these islands increased fires\nFloods more moisture in the air because of the warming of the ocean more
