influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised it by YouTube book on the program\nThanks for having show talked about how you came to work on this story I\nHave a two year old and a five year old vaccine toddler YouTube and I\nWas like what are all these things all these brands I'd never heard of these companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me looks kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nOh okay you're lots to unpack in there because the idea first of all of a toddler you to what what is that is it as it sounds\nSo Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old two year olds three year old ... and that's what I call tied to YouTube and it's this kind of\nWild place well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them all almost as much as adults it kind of see\nWho I mean YouTube is by far the most popular brand among children and even little children have their own favorite for one of the biggest brands within the space is called to chew TV you know they have a Nineteen billion views they have twenty nine million subscribers\nThis is a global children to entertain the kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back with the analogy you make in this

educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that the mission of of toddler YouTube in ... to TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they've banned entertainment they've been just trying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global\nPhenomenon of all these video\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un bay

than just something that affects up their time will show spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and\nAnd government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube is doing\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously a much different\nAnd the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically dishes where kids are going\nThis is where the whole businesses and so YouTube itself would have\nTo be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch what do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing to the kids setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit they might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups\nWhat about the kids young kids well I think\nYou know the the worst possible impact is that essentially the kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to back to kind of pacing that's actually
