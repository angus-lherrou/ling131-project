of ... screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe um everything's going to be All right\nTo best table maximum at this place it was three hundred dollars on two consecutive lucky lady squares and sure enough the first round one queen of heart was dealt on one of my best which had happened a number of times before I'd never won

kill\nUs and I tried to get ready I was hollow I was ...\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought\nAnd the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy ... his gun and started to shoot pending another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was a turning inside those holes\nAnd there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look at them for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet\nAnd I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was a really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some\nSandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at\nThe sound of

don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was\nParalyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking in that everything was

that guy and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to me it throws my bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing a motor soldiers do the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very\nVery brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve Italy without it being mistaken for something else\nThat was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we're going
