three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology\nAnd in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future so how do you do it well joining us now is Dan Gardner who is the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see is a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertainty and one way that we erase uncertainty is by turning to experts and saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nOne the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we bad at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasting has always get things wrong it exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good and so many other demands\nIs it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they do keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise] um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talk about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast but very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to get me to straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed productions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bombed by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nSeventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all ... they all said we're going to run out of oil um\nWill reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience the people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts all forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because there and tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often is heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know two months ago I said it was going to happen\n[laughter] yup and you know look it's a there's an old saying about me a mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future battle and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science fiction dance thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here and now dot org\nNow to the environmental fallout from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading

O. two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these\nUh schemes to remove the uh to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else as growing food\nUm that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects of even things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because the scale has to be so large\nWell and also we know that get trees only store carbon for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with a story in the two in um\nInjuries that um is not such an issue for storing it underground for example\nOkay so let's move on to some of the other ideas kind of capture storage what are some of the ideas here\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions or the way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy it takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops in a power plant and instead of putting that suit to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and that has the potential to remove\nA billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to it has a similar negative side of the fact that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use the stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could a crate and food security issues which is something we want to avoid what about\n... and by the way I just said Steven thinkers chicken provocative new book and lightened it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but what about just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical processes and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd to the ideas could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to that's an air capture that seemed to compress it and then store underground that is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nSo far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually switch started up and they say the costs that between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kind of C. O. two captured 'em get another company in Canada to protect closer to two hundred fifty per metric can but they catch expensive\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think the number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and in the ... you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about the technology is it's a concept come down so as you say claim works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of ... to\nTheir next plan plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of C. O. two\nThere's another company called carbon engineering in Canada that has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing it the first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that will be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so\nThis idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with costs that seemed to be starting to come down so there's the potential to really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the lemon juice impacts\nOne of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of CEO to by mid century um and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to\nSomething like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] and it sounds well are you getting investors excited about that\nThat may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes sat there more speculative and as this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse polarized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve last year or two in the water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate photosynthesis plankton and again ... the atmosphere in different ways where do you say though\nTo how her tag on a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in effect that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing the of two emissions if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called a ... term for it as moral hazard this idea that", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "15"}
