couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy forward and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked forward they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying the national sexual assault hotline report it in the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline cause tripled and Brazil oh heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy side of the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which\nIs a nearly doubled from bleak prior\nAnd five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase calling and right and what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flashback you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely feel flashback is for a survivor\nOr re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey're right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding ah they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd his friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe lousy Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nIn the feeling of being choked of being\nOf being and mobilized of being frozen and we know that when we experienced trauma\nOur brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we're going to fight organ experience fried or we're going to fleet and wildlife CSI Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with when\nYou say people have a flashback she's also explain to us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor read presidency too and she was six\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un ... university graduate schools ... enrolling for October ... applications at ... dot edu\nOr their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know what we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative as\nThey are able to define a frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way that trauma is stored in the brain\nTo literally re presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen at times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to and what that was exactly like for her time yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter a revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to me his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new than\nI did you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remove the winters so I don't remember how many [noise]\n\n[noise]\nAnd Brazil again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling safe to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling dismay and but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victim the main and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause it Dr Ford said and as I saw many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nCorrect and that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors\nAnd it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault whatever that assault was five days ago five weeks five months five years for Fifteen Years", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield", "day": "03"}
