sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha how much I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we hosted the kid the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the girls about what happened to the gym three is they will help out the car um why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we\nStarted filming with them in that governments safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks\nSo it was quite well they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when all counsellors to push them into reliving and telling us what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he could eat any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so it's twofold I think the government will say I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is this little ... down and they were releasing\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they they want free to speak to his they did give his diaries discreetly\n... and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they called us and the full ... treatment ... ah and in the film what we do is the uh the bills that the book goes who hate can lead actually just the tip of the ice that there are thousands of delve in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak\nAnd they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid should I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the ... that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest ... you marry a ... for either come slave and if you're a slave than you know\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and other western ... offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nYou end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights and and we're supposed to be that why it's say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast not had like she\nShe did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... if you'd have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... has been conducting children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they've just flooded their towns out of fear of Booker run they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah it is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these that golden id Pete come a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run through 'cause Boko Haram you know they don't just could not then the un and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous producer safety by numbers on that whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that way you have to run\nInto their ... but then a lot of uh I Love the tiny displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped vocal her um but they will sit and incredibly welcoming to the numbers the space people who have come to made it very\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory is in a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize control the Nigerian military\nAnd that constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to the the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks\nIn one night and he just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I Know you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said that's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and

the networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\n... more on Fox afterward only rarely do we bought for ... take on prime time with a five minute we can we can say you\nThis Monday edition sponsored by Google victory\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now and John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this right that's an ad for an ad ethically it's promo\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at any the are done\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jackpot what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means ... traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you'd as they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it and\nIt's also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing to last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand the content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say in the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile ride sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSame your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car and you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that all cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to a Tesla to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar a local company installing roof ground amounts and do all access trackers helping households live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nMonthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do\nYou think the markets too crowded no we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent in two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat do you what do you think about that I mean are people really eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYour so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen so you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely an ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility an equivalent level as you get today from ownership does absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to over so it was continue investing those partnerships and expanding our roster partners\nWell speaking of ... me neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it taught him was cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if your car could drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and it's maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues that eventually strangers you know it makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace like get around were checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nIn Contra special\nThe the PR

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what\nReally shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend that time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they will in their own words often describe themselves as addicted but Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now\nAnd it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but [noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by Ewan Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with where they're asked about\nUm their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials we\nMentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell that's hard to tell from\nThe the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft\nThat hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's there's such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adult\nBut in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors are very interested in\nPhysical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing is another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting or are not encouraging so and these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say that they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I mean because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... said special I saw that in some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that cue has has gone up over the generations so I think ... is definitely not the issue", "year": "2018",
