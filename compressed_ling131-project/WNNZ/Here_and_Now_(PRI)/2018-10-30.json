recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nI think it's basically a combination of not what the fed is doing which remember a short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note than say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the and back to the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in American history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of us who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether in grocery in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices a little one everyone talks about so the only thing about this country it's very diverse depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge added this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity flying well basically because fear\nYou know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically to suppress the level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh this inclination to take risks in the book insulin I might add discussing what are the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critical issue is that\nIn title ... which are mandated by law of gradually and an extra bleed driving our gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is a current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance\nThey'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield and shelter involves community grown and community on since Nineteen Seventy seven\nIs the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it they're going to cause the debt overall total government that was all over the rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation is a big problem out there who we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been of the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates since ... century bc Greece but not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we shut rates low cost ... point employment rates so which is the fact that productivity was running in a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy and a lot of part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see the signals and indeed\nThe unemployment rate kept falling oh well below a brief usual expectation\nOf like four percent but with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept fooling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo it is does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand I think\nThat what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two conditions are crying for crisis\nOne is a toxic assets like a secured ties to mortgages\nBut the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and one day or financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell I don't want to be a journal\nAnd I know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve keep breaks down during the period of very low unemployment\nThat was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire\nAre having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower productivity but it's an issue when you get to sort of tight labor market\nWage ... sensitive and it's for wage rate rises which affect the cost of production\nAnd hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up that's where the problem lies has a really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nStraining of New

all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community that diverse than the diversity in the community of

the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor but the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think what's reflected to him through the ... community\nAnd probably also taken the lead ... community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence or we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination\nThat word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I\nThis question for lady ...\nFascination me\n[noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it\nMean\nSomebody getting killed\nSort

talk about some other day\nHe likes\nThat sound or courtesy to Fred Rogers company laid ... lady overland goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tiger says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nA she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\nWhere I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown up there to listen and I think that the message to Graham naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said once that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team\nSo much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio certain and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first or the little children you're glad red zone or get your ticket to the art does\nOne um have surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with the helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes\n[noise] as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence will just and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the media has been showing recently\nI clean for your protection\nOf your young children\nThere is just so much\nA very young child can take\nWith out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think for Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the helpers helps uh see the good that is still around us\nFrank Rogers said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean the fly simply hateful where we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way [noise]\nThat were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified\nBy what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings on ... and manageable but find ways

Democrat Richard Cordray is up against Republican Mike DeWine joined goes covers state politics for Ohio public radio she's in Columbus I Joe\nHello and let's talk about these candidates a Richard Cordray a lot of people know him because he used to run the consumer financial Protection Bureau he's also a five time jeopardy champion and the marshals scholars tell us about him\n[laughter] yeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he would say that he's describing himself that\nWay actually but uh you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says ah people here know and he served as a state lawmaker he served as state treasurer he's served as a G and then as you said he served in the federal level\nHe's been out of state for a while but now he's back running for governor\nA and he is a coming in saying he wants to uphold the Affordable CARE Act he has a a\nComprehensive bond package a for road repair and infrastructure improvements so that's that's where he's running right\nOkay and Mike DeWine is the current ah AG of Ohio and we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but a ... he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former a U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor our former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea of having protections for um you know the pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nHari let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're gonna play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the wine who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let it out for the first it's my turn an outrage and anger and they get out it's my turn on your program and I get out shy proud of it's like OK here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst state in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he's leading the nation All right so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse in it and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to and it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those and\nIt would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you it'll all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nYou should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThem is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters are what are people what's on their minds\nLet's say like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows is that that it's you know very tight and ah we've got eight million voters we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there is a race here\n[noise] now a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined

us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now says Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\nFletcher and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nSomething more than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators\nAnd a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes a which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly in the pilots uh\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic
