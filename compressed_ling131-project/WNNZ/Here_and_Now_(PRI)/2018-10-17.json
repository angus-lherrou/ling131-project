and now with less than three weeks until the mid term elections many are wondering if the polls are correct and Democrats will make big gains in the house or if like in twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he\nProfiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nAnd Bradley junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\n[noise] this is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre um it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them\n[noise] well I went down initially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host\nAnd learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person or we do to another I ended up interviewing over the months a about a hundred in depth but settled on\nTwelve or who stories\nI decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related will speak like huge big league or big league may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people\nBase most of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level uh how ... they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really liked his style they just like to use his moxie his feisty in is how we get up every morning and I'm as a tweet storm and I'm six to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is at least not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up the wall yeah\nSo here's the hit to any of your is offering a special sale deal on tickets for our Janice baby

you're really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump it's still\nPredominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm\nA woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God she believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing that he's been married three times they don't care for them\nThe the most important issues are abortion and his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is ... you could go there

about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and uh working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump maybe at the margins are\nThe unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump or the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan he\nSaid that he would reduce the deficit by in his first eight years\nThere's only going up the budget he filed in February ... shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you'll Republican Party doesn't seem to care ... ... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I\nThink it's it's

feeling of being left out so the school ended a policy question is it the right thing to group African American and Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr

are very proud of university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator from rolling for October ... applications at ... dot edu\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful\nTalk about what is happening for these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter calls why are all the black kids sitting together and the cafeteria [noise] it seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\n[noise] one of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girls and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that\nSure well if I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white\nBut that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like then you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious\nCycle because very often the kids are in those lower tractor maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that\nBecause there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper\nTracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book but to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what can we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like\nSegregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city\nOut to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and very proud of university graduate schools ... enrolling for October ... applications a pest dot edu\nOr black or Latino and often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing\nThis also may not um echo but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that\nAnd to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance that she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly yeah you have things like that going onto unintentional\nYes unintentional I mean that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse as if they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more support it\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class\nBy the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why the white kids sitting in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nAnd the media today\nTo bargain contract special on Sunday October twenty first to twenty eight to on the pay any PR news network\nThe any PR news network is funded by you and

is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you've said his ballets got the wrong short or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are

offering a special treat he'll deal on tickets for our Janice baby holiday party on Saturday December first [noise] grab your tickets now at your that [noise]\nCould get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George in who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now Hi Jeremy [noise] so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested\nA upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer at outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kinda ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about you know some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest\nThe New York times also rated the possibility of fraud and that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law\nAllowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed at that time\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nEarly Nineteen twenties uh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials of the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns\nAnd because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executive under the present it and so obviously Congress realized gee we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlacing blind trust his business interests but simply a retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge in ... in that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing administration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what do we really going to learn from them well that's a\nTough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be satisfied without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first dude filed returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that", "show_name": "Here and Now
