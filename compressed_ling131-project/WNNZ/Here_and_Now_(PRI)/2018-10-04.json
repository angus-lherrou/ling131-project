and thirty thousand dollars to her to stay quiet about it just a month before the election in twenty sixteen\nTrump's former fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance law by making that payment will Stormy Daniels has a book out this week called full disclosure she joined me from Beverly Hills to talk about it it is a memoir about more than the night she says she slept with Trump\nEverybody wanted me to write a tell all and I was like I really don't want to do that because you know that doesn't define me of course everybody knows that you know about that ethic you know Ninety seconds and ah back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it'd be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that a an interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I Want it to express got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSuddenly like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said how things transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I've you\nKnow it might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you're talking about at the beginning you grew up in Baton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food\nOr you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called a liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\nWhat are you able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that I don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for\nWhere I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although and its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never sign a nondisclosure I'm not stupid um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted to go away didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes normal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got league and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false\nI was fine with saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and I just wanted to set the record straight and I just wanted to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nUm I think we're about to find out on what is a December twelve he was the kind of the orchestrated\nStreaming up New England public radio was funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nBlew it you know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled\nAnd then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure way before I did and then when he realized he'd messed up he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that\nI also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call the he admitted that I was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of names I have a pretty thick skin being\nIn the adult entertainment business you know [noise] but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWill you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reason for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure\nNow my fear lies mostly with just sort of crazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they are awesome [laughter]\nBut what is that what is that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I was used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted it I've gotten used to it and we've become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they harbor this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over\nCompensating as you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years um as it shaped the way that you perceived him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends in his own business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people in high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very privileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today how would you describe it today\nI don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report in the wall Street Journal this week uh that alleges that Trump personally directed in an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday I had just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news now are you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nAh actually the exact opposite [laughter] from around the ... [noise] she asked for like the first couple of months I was obsessed and was reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nSo you're not following politics closely\nThings yes but I'm not reading the news and the news stories and specially staying away from anything about me\nWhere you're coming out with this book just uh\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the western ... offering personal and professional gross through which remember coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nThe Republican chair of the committee Senator Chuck Grassley says the FBI found no hint of misconduct you're listening to hear now Los\n\nThis was the M.

album ... by polo and pan it came out last year but then it got re released this year in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on to my radar um it's kind of very tropical kind of deal that route the album\nUm and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so I just want to catch everybody our I'm classic ... this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll still use it next summer too but when I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find\nThree or four songs on an album I'm really happy and that's what I consider that to be a good album or this care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of I'm On my show already\nSo basically like every every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be into that many of\nThe songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have\nHave like some songs inspired by Brazilians some butter some daytime disco system club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the ... overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say you know they've definitely got an ear for pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bans I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meets cool side\nOh I like that that's great we have poolside on the show actually they're great um yeah\nLet's listen to the next one you brought up this is the Swedish group by agra boys are this is called for [noise]\n\n\n\nTell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely without going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular song and some people they're saying it's a commentary on male hyper masculinity um when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fund track\n'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was a little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep and is it would give me a way to fire up before bed and this\nSong sort of has the same effect on me every time I hear it and obviously funny would you say it's like a good listen to do you like to listen to this song is an unbelievably find listen and yet I mean like just after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the sun moves on to become the belief singers bashing Murphy becomes more and more ... um until the end he's basically just a blob puddle I'm poor people can people can\nGo on our website and listen to the entire thing it here now I Hope they do I really

you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through which member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com [noise]\nThat all I Do\nAbsolutely I mean it's such an orthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with a song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it it's just kind of other worldly who is maverick saber\nHe's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with the song drifting a but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and coming R. and\nB. singer

one that you brought us is Wolverine a this is from Diana Gordon [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich we know about this one Diana Gordon just released her first ET as a solo artist but she's been around the music industry for a while and she's written for marriage ... and she had three songs on beyond says lemonade album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nThis is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing sort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess but clearly multi talented person [noise] yeah I mean she she definitely knows how to write songs and and she can sing them too I mean sometimes when the singers things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat of experience\nIn their voice to me this is one of those instances um issues just sort of recalling her upbringing and sort of you know it's also very aspirational at the same time\nThe last one that you
