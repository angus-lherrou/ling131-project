is having a moment to China and that is deeply frightening to the Chinese government\nVenture is author of the book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so I'm In these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed in twenty Fifteen for planning to celebrate International Women's day\nUm and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan the police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them for thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what has done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because\nThe authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with and and and the and it was something\nI can too disturbing that social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine um\nWell I mean among the feminist five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in a women's rights movement has personally been\nUm victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five a month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there'll be some people who remember mostly domes a famous adage women hold up half the sky and his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China\nAre equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to have seen the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care\nStreaming of New England public radio is one W and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nIn the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who've been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially and so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a\nParticularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and ... and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how was the Japanese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college and wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's been encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um

know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to did you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where\nWhen nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared I didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and that sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian

and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal\nMonologue you can tell that he is really hurting and I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know step or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you

economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government on couches Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is that of Saudi led coalition with us support and so you know

history had a pretty simple plan they dressed up and cop uniforms and ring the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere have been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the street and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come until we ... them into the museum\nThat guard what'd you make out that\nThey came in and they turn so I could see if I could see that they had had those

recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you know as I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nAt nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read I could bring my practice I was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nRandy doesn't recall any special training or specific instructions for the night shift beyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on on the floor during his round he did that by swiping magnetic trap he wasn't
