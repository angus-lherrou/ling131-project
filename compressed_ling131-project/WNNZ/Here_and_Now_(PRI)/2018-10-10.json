retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my ah medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we are going to be with you all the victims ah will help you out do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct but our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know

riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally you had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk of the law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nAnd the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nAre great and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during that shooting and after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know do do I thank him do I say great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWhat are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um\nMore maybe I don't know natural\nOr it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings

and the community and foreign born ... according to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James harm the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of\nA little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans Vietnamese Americans\nCome from a country that came from a lot of trauma war\nTypes of financial distress\nThe first generation tend to say why the Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption in government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic\nI think because of the American values the\nLaw to this Korean Americans I grew up in second generation uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas and to focus more progressive thinking than more of the conservative suburban ideals\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nThe thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration\nSystem so it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally of a majority of them\nAnd they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my friends are being more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republicans I myself have have definitely some qualms about the key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new when we met them at a cafe ... owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon and he told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think in you know you look at the generation one which is our parents and and I we we're one point fights and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of our visit family\nCash only pay you know you don't want to say what we have our own strategies and we don't want to share best practices because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and

from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this

popular\nName Korean Americans in a bigger quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this\nConnection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent me up there\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew when\nYou don't see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party at the public in a Democrat\nThat sentiment says Mary and food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education\nAnd housing Asian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from our where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages you speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish and and and you know my family's been here for so long that\nIt it's those types of questions we only get it and so it makes people
