it's about a dog a highly cleaned great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together he spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about the suicide of of people that have very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a

second and you'll just be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first ... helping your blood red zone or get your tickets to do anything for ... minutes\nWay that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like sings\nFat is a quote from Jay I'm ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lower like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more in it\nAnd say you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dog sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nIt seems odd to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say yes anyone noticed or killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wandering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog because you presume it's like old yell or\nUber's name okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that is a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody I Swear to party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle memory but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know we do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books in certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google especially Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYeah since they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIt true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged\nWe have so much for last year we do it again in public radio certain and you'll just be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first moved to North up in your blood red zone at Circuit City the Oregon\nHas been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and just sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know what it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou will to talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throats because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my my married are really does Mitt this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats you'd do dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that uh her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNow dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer of the public radio as a writer Alice for low who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's [laughter] that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who want to wrestle a story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they haven't really really good experience they have very strong feelings

education\nThe law was passed in twenty Fifteen and it's being enacted as suicide rates for kids and teens who are in fact according to the Centers for Disease Control and prevention suicide became the second leading cause of death the Americans and twenty sixteen behind car accidents\nGlenn leaving is CEO of the mental health association in New York state a group that's pushed for this law for years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and and to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and\nIt's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum\nBecause what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York so we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans and best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city not that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states\nBut just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health and general\nEat well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so\nThat also has to take into into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do in response is we were able to create a resource center is who mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts me through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a\nYou know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that their lesson plans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou've got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people that here now dot org but really sample like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school wasn't like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might one be in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on in the ground in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially to very early age\nBut this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and

where buildings sort of like the\nThe structure now for an individual to have that that emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment this and I also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education but as you noted opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to that and look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma\nTalk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that you know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people that would be much more open about talking about it\nThat's cleanliness and he's the c._e._o. of the nonprofit mental health association of New York state one
