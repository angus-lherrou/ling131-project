statistic by twenty fifty to World Bank predicts that climate change could create as many as one hundred and forty three million climate migrants people moving to new places to escape conditions that are making it difficult to live\nTo put that into context that's double the number of refugees in the world today and well that migration would be unprecedented we have seen is smaller movements because of climate before many times within the United states\nIt airs and Nathan Connelly our historians and host of the podcast back story will come back I happier now I Know you're both us historians but I'm going to ask you to stretch the limits of your scholarship here are way way back to long before we were ever a country\nUm what was the first human migrations that we saw because of climate in North America well archaeologist\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nAre migrating because of massive droughts in the west and southwest and the Americans of course are being populated by people who are migrating from Asia so we have no sense of all the ways in which climate was driving them in the first place but even in those migrations and the twelve\nAnd Thirteen century you have a very clear reliance on crops like Mays I'm ways in which people are not able to rely on the consistency of the rains I mean decades long droughts in some cases\nAnd so these populations are being forced to move into come into contact and so you have this Sunni and the hoping in the ... on who are moving through and trying to find new villages in some cases\nMoving along rivers and creating new moments of cultural contact but great stress I mean you're talking about thousands of people who are forced to move on to relocate oftentimes abandoning whole cities of civilization some of those places that we now see a tourist attractions in the southwest of these\nAnd empty villages in the hillside some of those are a product of these large massive migrations of another side point of this of course when the Europeans arrived\nMany of them are migrants of a very related sword I mean they're fleeing certain kinds of hardship in Europe and many of them are talking about for instance to abundant timber in places like North America and trying to find ways in which they can get a slightly more regular livelihood given the deforestation that happened\nIn Europe and the Eighteenth uh nineteenth century and so there's going to be a constant relationship\nBetween mass migrations and concerns about the climate and sustainability\nAnd then once those Europeans got here and started establishing their own communities here what happened to me do we see similar things moving forward\nWhat we need to think about the relationship between climate change is an issue about people as well you could argue that the to the worst things have happened in American history are directly related to that process which is the forced migration of a million people are across the American south\nOr because the climate there enabled this new crop of cotton that are tied back to Europe the way that Nathan was talking before these new industries that are driving\nAnd you found that I mean you were to slavery I mean I'm Sorry I just uh just to be specific to your slavery I'm Talking about and you are seeing that in many ways the worst slavery or in southern Louisiana and the sugar cane fields which go up to the very boundary where the climate will allow them to go and and the rice\nFields on the on the planet coast so you see very finely attuned to just a few degrees temperatures you were talking about before about how you can have this forced migration of millions of people in slavery\nSo I'm hearing a scene here that people tend to follow where the plants and the crops will go because of course that's how we sustain ourselves but also our economy is um what about other reasons that people move historically related to the climate well\nIf you think about the ... large concern now around Atlantic storms there again there's a history to the ways in which hurricanes have forced all kinds of people to basically pull up stakes and relocate I mean this again has a kind of hemispheric\nImpact if you think for instance about some of the Atlantic storms that came through the Caribbean or even hit the southeast in the early part of the twentieth century many of these work quite cataclysmic with really substantial effects I mean you think about a storm in Nineteen Seventeen that really is wrecking the Caribbean and forcing people in the U.S descend remittances back in the Nineteen fifties\nYou have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps to spawn migration to England in that decade and even in the United states is a huge hurricane\nIn Nineteen forty seven late September\nThat creates a huge problem of displacement in the south east of the United states because largely the infrastructure isn't there and this is a reminder to listeners to think about on natural disasters right to Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans was about levees breaking for instance and in the south in the Nineteen forties you at farmers who are being displaced folks were relocated\nBecause of racial segregation statues in the south had their whole homes relocated and then subsequently ripped up by massive hurricanes you're talking about a hundred in some cases thousands of migrants of Atlantic storms because of discrimination and a lack of infrastructure even within the United states in the Nineteen forties\nYou know we're talking about that even still today especially as these hurricanes come up the coast a lot of the conversation after those storms ripped through and destroy communities is should we rebuild right here on this coastline right again and it's\nThe absolutely what's interesting is how much of that building is a recent\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England

everything's enabled by air conditioning which is a post World war two innovation so the migration voluntary involuntary is sort of creating so to speak a perfect storm where people are moving to where the greatest vulnerabilities lie\nWe've got to talk about the dust bowl the Nineteen thirties hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced at a very difficult time for the country during the depression and this was not just weather related it also had to do a lot with how Americans were interacting\nWith the land\nSo there were severe drought during the Nineteen thirties and and window erosion that was accompanied hum are really came on the heels of really inefficient irrigation techniques and so angered soil you know basically came up and was turned to to dust and you had over a hundred million acres in Texas Oklahoma New Mexico Kansas and so forth basically ruined as a result of\nUh getting decades long degradation the crop losses alone\nWere twenty five million dollars per day that's a Nineteen thirty six dollars talking almost four hundred and fifty million dollars of losses every single day during the ... in the thirties nearly three million people who leave the plain states most of whom go to California and California itself\nBegins than in the series of laws to basically restrict some of these migrants in Nineteen thirty three indigent act in California actually made it a crime\nTo bring indigent person into the state you have local attorneys trying to enforce it with verve and it's not until the ACLU really fights back against is that you get a Supreme Court case in Nineteen forty one that actually makes it okay makes it a law in America\nTo not restrict interstate migration for poor people\nYou write I'm thinking back to the grapes of wrath and the images of the family moving from their homes to the west coast as they were\nDefinitely vilified people were vilified these migrants were not treated well and it lived as a hint at what might happen in the future doesn't it uh when this happens if it happens again\nWell we need to remember too that one reason we have the grapes of wrath is that it was about white people moving ride been about poor indigent why people we don't really have representations of\nPeople of other ethnic backgrounds who hadn't been displaced and and move so I think that it's interesting that we ... gives us something to think with but it doesn't really reflect the picture\nWell I'm from the southwest and my family first moved there in the Nineteen fifties because at that time the weather was good\nThe

of the most evident last week she brought\nFor vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in owing ville it's a town of about Fifteen hundred people and you know a whole bunch of people from there and and all around the district came to see the vice president\nNow the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere's certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may be nationwide interest in this race\nI mean it's at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick\nAnd what do the polls say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge and and really it's something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of

thank you\nThanks Peter the TV show the Congress premier this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was a hit it was cancelled though after it start tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Rick\nHi so the first episode is send off to the character Roseanne counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only a pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\n[noise] I think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked [laughter] so\nUm they had for shadow that I'm Roseanne Connor the character would be struggling with a an addiction and pain pills and so if they're going to kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and and also hooks it into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talking about because of the way that there was a kind of character past well\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show a and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors we're down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when it returned last march\nRight but um these the feces going on there I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting\nAnd then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter\nAnd I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show so I think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of his run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level but it's drawing\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate

in the audience and retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to Roseanne character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did in Roseanne\nI think two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face to working class family and it wasn't quite as part is that I mean\nUs we're up Thirteen percent last month you're listening to here in Los\n\nThis

December first of the ... open your blood red zone or get your tickets to the ... minutes\nOr what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWell talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday is really an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has black Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to a\nGreat question and I'm Glad you raised it Jeremy my the book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble and the silver market but\nWhat was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street\nWas the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that they are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion apart for those who were paying attention\nAnd then along the way I illustrate the ... heated occasions when a panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky\nThis was the culmination of a series of misjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years and they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators more the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who we are creating the new products that would show a effect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kind of familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand and you know people talking about a lot of ah fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in high speed hurt investing strategies with fragmented

was appointing people who wanted to cut back on regulations how much responsibility did Reagan and his administration have in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven\nWell it's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the way that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so they do the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back\nOn big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by a staunch Republican Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge in Washington\nSo both the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left in the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they won and more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all of these new products enough to oversee\nWell that's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nWe don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of\nI think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are extremely complex and yes they are\nAlgorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people on the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staffed so they can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding in writing this book of why crash has happened how something that seems small can get out of control very quickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise you know we've been laboring for decades under the um the notion of inefficient and market a rational market where
