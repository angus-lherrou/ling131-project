sicker worse that sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many gets to a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiatives\nHe also teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and as well ... is with us in Studio welcome\nThank you very much he was just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why what would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWhile they were a pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of the students are took the corps and students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the very meticulous and program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and there's of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that it has actually ... where the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the corps and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean the\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say eight o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up a\nLot of extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets a circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk I'm so during evolution a we couldn't see during the night time\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell there's that we used to be talked about some of the health issues that arise just from not sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now out in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nThe problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer and dementia\nIt ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attack and stroke not to mention diabetes are you interested Bill Clinton sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you says ...\nAppetite I mean if if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nFelt part of the programs are we caught sleep on on a very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on his sneakers and they find out that if the\nTank up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nFailing all free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the timing of sleep apnea so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found that those who have irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston\nAnd that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder that they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWow so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep maybe an oddity thing and not have a steady group when am\nI right so when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seven are have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleventh hour interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity\nSchool sanctioned activity and the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working and we're talking to you most specifically about students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and women's\nHospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers firefighters he took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report in injury you have as many disability days and you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post similar to sit here now doubt or\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we met at a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour I give me one detail so we did see a sleep disorders screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires and we identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders and we refer them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and women out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep if you can't breathe and sleep at the same time you know\nSo here's a two and he was offering a special

either become refugees in these and mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I wondered every time I saw yet another empty talents ... well what's happened to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it liberal and I think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself\nUp ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a shoulder will do to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up and they offered them a way out where they would be bus stop to it lip\nAnd that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive ... areas we did talk to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThe war to in the hot out of the country it is done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus do you go to places like the area rounded lip than you can really see walk the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nWell so what happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that if you know taken advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people
