watching and dreaming of their own careers in the majors\nMany of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic\nBaseball greats from one Marshalls too big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez\nTwenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded a charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those it helped go to college in Boston was an athlete named Carol Lena\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married now ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the D R and D is building a charter school to teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors\nShe says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of a young prospects do not finish high school and then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life they don't know what to\nDo so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too\nOf course it happens when my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners\nAnd we should say you come from a baseball family you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a little league and the the earth that has gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes\nYes they receive a really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he ... and the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors so both of them were sign at sixteen\nAnd they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to feed them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was relief and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven and now I'm twenty six I'm not going to go sit\nIn a classroom with high school kids I'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who pager isn't\nIt just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd data known how to go back to society to their lives what\nCould you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or

related to the sports industry and they can go back and get a job either with another team and Emma Lee or maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball players but\nIs it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids could be realistic\nAnd the Dominican all thirty teams of ... will be have academies where they signed the players so there's a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think

staples\nBusiness here and now a remote island in Hawaii is practically vanished\nThe small spit of sand known as east island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals today it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into\nFrench ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned most\nPeople have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures in here now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out a there is a sort of upper region to the island where the turtles 'cause I'm digs their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being this Easter Island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land\nThey'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane did this much damage\nWell answer's yes to both of those I figured and um [noise]\nThat this island under the threat of the level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location thus far north that it's still a very a strong chance of being intercepted by a hurricane but of course of climate\nWe have so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north happen you're glad rags zone and get your ticket today at NPR does this\nAnd there are new areas new habitats anew human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes but that hasn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or the other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in order to marry on his islands are at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category since last year as hurricane season and twenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if let's say earned um was moved by the hurricane to the north north east\nThe trade when wave may push that fan back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat chip fluctuate a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us\nYeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAdjacent Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policy shift about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economic\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what did we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rate what they mean is something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do nice fair comparison right I'm a very high growth rates in China we have very high growth eighth in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty now in fact there is like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets for ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more genes than meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield in children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nYou're not scared of that you become part of a movement that would do what anyone who is emphasizing any movement that it's trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nBody was recovered early today a day after in middle school students and teachers visiting hot springs in the area where swept away by the tar and you're listening to here and\n\nThis is the any PR news network today's forecast mostly sunny the temperature in the mid forties mostly crowded tonight rain and snow showers after midnight with Lowes in the lower thirties rain showers tomorrow highs in the mid forties and the chance of showers Sunday\nThe PR news network is funded by you at ATC environmental consulting testing on training solutions for soil groundwater and hazardous materials in West Springfield agawam out throughout New England ATC G.

hundred albums more than forty F a bandleader so why go solar this time around [noise]\nBut that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar there was the social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with the guitar it was like this magic wand that she should\nBring every one together and so all along but guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know this is the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore when it first you know but it's something that sort of hanging out there in front of me that I Try to\nI'm just trying to get it together to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech collect that like talk about a nightmare\nSituation if you could only have had an instrument with you\nYeah yeah I mean to do long as I've got that in my hands then everything's cool\nSo then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself in here to another level yeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's\nA because over the years it's become just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and it was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so\nA year later I tried it again and then I\nKept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like [noise] like music [noise]\nWell it seems like every time to talk about uh thankful [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\nThe sun like this what comes for no more [laughter] it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because he said it's a tribute to the musician paint platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know I'd say not\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nCalled pretty stars to shine and that was something I ... quote unquote row\nThese signs that book and the album ... and then made to shine you did when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common court when\nPrior to the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing some of the music that I Would record it played that\nSong and a guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of Jesse James though what what are you talking about something just to\nPlay me this recording and it was like oh my God that's the same exact almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and it was\nLike you know it's just an old traditional I'm like I probably heard the Kingston Trio play it when I was five years old or something like a money making yeah I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's a you know it's like uh\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you had all the energy solar helping homes businesses that farms in western New England save money and the

about track for which is what do you want to listen to\n\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one or two they played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustained and\nThen with some other processing so they're sort of a drone\nOne now\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to [noise] like a fire drop auto pedal that's all that shit [noise]\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for just\nOne solo guitar [noise]\n\n\nMm\n\n\n[noise] you know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen you mean as you're playing either ... yeah\nWell the composing is you know happy now these are pieces [noise] they never feel like they're finished anyway but\nWhat I Do to prepare for the album was actually played six night at the stone in New York every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mind or new ones\nAnd I tried to keep myself just off balance for the whole week and that's what I wanted\nTo continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for companies you know I don't think you would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusually difficult uncomfortable place intentionally\nWell but that's when the stuff really happen so I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming and you jump off a cliff and you you just start flying in that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take these chances but I say
