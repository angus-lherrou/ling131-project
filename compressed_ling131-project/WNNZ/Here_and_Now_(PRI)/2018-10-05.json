Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nUh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and they weren't a lotta sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think his left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of stuff with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for them ... factor and bringing back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far uh some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pup demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of store ... politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and ... will and grace and NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled or revivals you know they have ... magnum PI they have ... they have mcgyver\nAnd all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill or procedural adventure stories and ... and slapped ... the show uh over it so\nUm you know those have been under the radar and the way they get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kinda phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show ... minutes syndication for a long time so\nAh you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it um it's still a little awkward and kinda old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\n...

nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan and senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Germany well it certainly the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today well right as you\nMentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through

were just you know it's more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAbsolutely yeah and ah you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict do to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so it does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now a ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet\nUm but it's it by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about and overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be

district went for President Trump so tell us what about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and
