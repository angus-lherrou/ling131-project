net\nIt's here and now I'm Robyn Young in Florida where one of the hottest places in the country that a little more heated yesterday\nThe Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history\nProbably it's most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gail I'm against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs and others on behalf of its citizens\nAnd so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee\nWhich is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nHe's in his Tallahassee is the eighth largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMustard is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMissile defenses described a community is one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if humidity's do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high lawless or you know ... this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality\nI Want to see that President Trump you know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was this huge for the president you may no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his losing his without acts of leadership\nWell an absence of leadership as you as you put it President Trump's polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nI'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normal lives\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR are done and that\nMeans that the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals referring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd that sort of saint as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself in a print is that Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of Davis is\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nJust said if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ... and how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars I'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor\nMy differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day\nOn the phone talk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region\nYour opponent percentage is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast certainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd we're we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrates going into ...\nWhen we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nAnd we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum ... democratic gubernatorial

Ryan hey Robin thing from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it into this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent isn't some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies and the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nI'm democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president said people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which send a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew\nGillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWhile I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying\nNo I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the fantasy was up by you know however many points and and uh I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results the Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate well\nAnd make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of president also has pulled the wild card in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this as he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way through Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com or Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the caravan and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention described and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to the midterm election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turn of both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cabinet reportedly was organized by a church is that and it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last candidate that made you got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were kept in into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nAnd you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Rob and you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nA trombone just state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans or many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the ... over the Puerto Ricans have seems ah coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role and the result\nUh for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nThey like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent

felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board you went back there right\nBut I'm a vendor sex voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to the to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were

people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a former felon himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a party at the immunity couldn't happening most I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back his administration has also granted fewer felons clemency\nScott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three

could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we'll amongst other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided\nOn an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the

sheriff wall to McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nLeads to other things like a you know the sexual batters who are those keeping them away from kids and way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those appropriate steps to take but just the a fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nDeters them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only served to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a lot of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally ... I went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I Want it in an office to relax certain things with a little got involved because I said what I can make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen it kinda made me feel like well if another citizen ...\nSawyer recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it was kind of like a book of this is part of a book list I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do or die just me for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in a case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissent is will shape the future court\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland nice even person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is an office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into that\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course London do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ...

I mean there's a new housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo than I Want to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who've been hurt by Michael\nThe lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of roofers and a lot of um license activity\nWhat else do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increased benefit\nIf there's not enough plumbers in town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of work than when they did the jobs they raise their prices because they know there's no one else to come in to take the work\nOr if mark has his paint are coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by and see me I'll tell\nYou Patti mark in the back as you're saying that [laughter]\n... small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's neat and training one thing but you're talking about stealing you conceding though we are ... you talked about what happened because of the recession a huge blow but then you have this you know slow steady blow\nThat has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markers are impacting the building industry\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would not get done so where do you do what we're\nDoing through education and bringing our co younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we taught them it's gotta be college has got to because it's got to be college and you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here and and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and so many people the colleges in the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future billed as America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but but not to lead immigration just yet if you had the ear of the next governor then you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you telling me it's necessary for your industry so\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded

workers\nOften times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard they're staying till sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that far industry and other industries need\nMarked I hear you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area\nNeeds to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nTheir homes are gone their place of business might be gone to shop the ad is gone\nIt's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what else would change this place and we see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools\nWe spent many years not exposing young people to that\nType work and telling them what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college the guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement in kind of making it more enticing ... how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisor heroes and you're you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDouble triple that one more thing I think the stigma that's what the big talk later that last Thirty years you gotta have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big Harley you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it may be certain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will know how to do ... ...\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived we're not that much different than what we're
