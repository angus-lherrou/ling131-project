Souza has a new book out today he's the former White House photographer for President Obama who's made a name for himself on Instagram throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's [laughter] it's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice\nWhere uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary and how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than the oval office so I posted\nA picture of a President Obama with the\nThe red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter] and I guess it was a double meaning and my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone or said that I was throwing shade on the new a new\nPresident and you didn't even know what that tournament I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started a post civil war and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest credit history was really on January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it\nI mean I kind of picture says it all\nRight right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true\nYes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary that is very rarely is there\nA negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they end up coming back to the sea and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nA ... in this book or you've got time often either Trump tweets a alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but to to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know tell me and\nShe spoke poke I guess what's the one that you're most proud of\nThey like I Can't believe I thought of that [laughter] uh\nStreaming of New England public radio

written that an exclamation points in all caps a ... in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which\nI I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he has more of an aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history\nFox News ... every other network and you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty times in the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had the kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] but especially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over it was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter]\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a Elton John right and I said there's only one\nRocket man [laughter] ... what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nYou know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA ... boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book it's actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and he just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe U.S ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post\nAmong the surround no these are all a pictures that were previously made public or in the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use then there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you wanna do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come um\nI don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access\nAnd I think I Would just be frustrated I'm

their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some\nSort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the\nWay many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like\nThat that they could go to so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or\nSome other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes for a let's say an African American students is one of a few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced they're having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects a minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much of a you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those ends even though there I'm sort of a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of than twenty eleven
