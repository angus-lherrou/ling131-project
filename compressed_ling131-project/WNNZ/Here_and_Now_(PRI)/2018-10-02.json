Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which are his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which\nAh that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which an incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that our first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when a your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you you have the same meaning it was ...\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence a sixteen year book page\nOn 'em game Philip bump that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear what booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious that a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the between routes club which is pretty obviously right they reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term as your book devil's triangle areas\nDevil's triangle drinking game has played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYou're quite quarters no okay so ...\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are the devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups arranging a triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so ah [noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from a certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farms down small ones farm dot com\nAre all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nA books that they have ...

I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank there were often times in which he appeared to be incapacitated a and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him than that\nIt is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some regularity and high school\nOr gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which is that he doesn't he never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of disadvantage for happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nIf judge Kavanaugh shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I Would think\nBut that's not true in every prison we go to one where change is happening on the world [noise]\nListen this afternoon at three and this evening at seven on the NPR News network for the world\nThe any PR news network is funded by you uncommitted guitar helping the terrorists to connect as they develop new skills and shared repertoire fall classes for players at different levels of ability forming no community guitar dot com\nAnd by paying you catering celebrating sixteen years serving the pioneer valley hand but he on through catering cooking lessons and unique food experiences PY catering dot com\nStay tuned for the second hour if you are now\nDoes it would be any PR news network WINZ am six forty Westfield WINZ FM Ninety One seven Deerfield\nWFCR eighty eight five HD three Amherst W and then you eighty nine five great Barrington W and a nine Ninety eight nine Adams WAMC Ninety One nine Springfield and W.

year and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers welcome back to her now\nGlad to be with Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little I fill up the old trade regime between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one\nAnd this one's not very different how it could possibly be worth major alienation of major allies I Can't imagine\nThese are relatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing as it was this has been a major diversion\nFrom the important domestic challenges facing the United states and the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement principally because I was happy with the older Raymond and\nI Can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement should be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are tiny\nCompared to the overall economy the ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia has been constrained this has been a the most short sighted\nOf strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI think there are major issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used to go after them have been quite problematic\nThey emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese on a road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage an influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which has surely the most effective way to influence Chinese behavior I think that any ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit from an ... with a farm standard for sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nChinese trade practices and in particular to once relating to intellectual property\nBut I don't think the strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China they're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want\nTariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs that companies need in order to compete\nThat's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient\nAnd so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of President Trump\nIs clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist but it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge\nSponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a rally\nRepublican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders\nMore than their previous convictions to stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about centers who regarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well\n[noise] what do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much\nIs likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession is likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farm stand small ones farm dot com\nA lotta people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nIt's possible uh there is some evidence that at the end of expansions there's a tendency for productivity growth to slow\nAnd that may be for the reason you're a companion suggest that ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified but it seems to me that what is striking is how slow\nFrom Spanish Moroccan authorities you're listening to hear now [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the M.

rent\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at ... university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator ... enrolling for October ... second applications at bay path dot edu\nScott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then let's let's got tell it he joins us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome Hi thanks for having me\nWell nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete ad me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives she moved you started saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that podcast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalk about the stress as you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town and our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know beyond\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in art eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of the major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really liked my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all and you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant true is that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they path university graduate schools MS and applied laboratories outside operations on rolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay past dot edu\nBreeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance but the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough\nThat the whole goal was not to make too big footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game and have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know and then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big Gibson dives\nAnd if you can ride those way that you can ride those lows and you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a a nice entry point for me well\nIn part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable with some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved ... leaving our friends leaving what we knew um\nAnd I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work at an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it's just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire with like ... one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
