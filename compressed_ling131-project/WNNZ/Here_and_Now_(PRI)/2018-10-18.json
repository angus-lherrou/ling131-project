I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLead started looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are we're even seeing our impact up on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people say we're always talking about stars\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warns us in cools us an envelop says with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and then while we're connected to the greater universe which I'm very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this

one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years [noise]\nSo let's I when I hear your starship is about making sure that capability for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really change fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we do foul our planet through pollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happened to other people that we understand that we have to
