'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or caused autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sides and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolved including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Andy Anderson in

pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people

here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it is involved deep frying at home is completely doable but it's involved what I Would be afraid I Would start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step\nYeah I use a walk\nA walk the ideal shape\nFor holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nAdd about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Crisco you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix and I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can\nConstantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to tape it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch alright\nWould be good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that acidic flavor but it also does tend to rise to chicken\nI take it out and then I got it well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another track okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the press pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for a different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some limits so I Do so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey\nAdds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south this would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFried show yeah I'd like to write the hunting isn't the hunting has really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's settle down a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown\nBut the idea behind having\nNot greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or\nTwo frying 's okay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is\nMy version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw is ginger little catch upsetting to me and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic

down again the chili paste the ginger and\n\nYou're listening to the end if you're a news network today's forecast mostly crowded with a chance of afternoon showers at highs and the sixties cloudy

Franklin Community co op offering organic produce the goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nDistricts trying to figure all this out currently welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year\nDo you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country or you've seen a an issue where people are getting priced out of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and\nLike I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them\nUm it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognized\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nIt's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that brought you in Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAt that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska\nThis is in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different\nEmployment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need\nSo what kind of help where you get it\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to have the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis that's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team at Bethel it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely to drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes this cycle\nOf poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students um their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it ... them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018",
