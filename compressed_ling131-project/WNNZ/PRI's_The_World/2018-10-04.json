Brazil\nThousands of social media accounts that are coordinating their activity either because they're automated like botnets or their\nLittle armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly and as broadly as possible\nUm and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assumed that they're just kind of hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on their foreign policy objective but what's interesting is that when there is a really contentious domestic issues here in the U. S. like the Kavanaugh nomination for example they do\nTurn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we found twenty sixteen\nOr these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the cruise or work Senate race in Texas for a while there is a lot of social media engagement around that race\nAnd there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms have improved their ability to detect certain types of tactics that we know are associates\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nOr a new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections very divisive\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the better and the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course\nThat's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to\nUm exacerbate that ah that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard the story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S [noise] they are\nAnd I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information is actually less about the truth or the authenticity of any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative or one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify the sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nI think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually won in the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr

of social media accounts that are coordinating their activity either because they're automated like botnets or their little armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly and as broadly as possible\nUm and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assume that they're just kinda hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous\nAnd in terms of foreign actors or Russia doesn't surprise me but but what are Iran and Israel up to\nVery similar things similar to Russia we see these networks of accounts focused on their foreign policy objective but what's interesting is that when there's a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S like the Kavanaugh nomination for example they do\nTurn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue kind of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we saw on twenty sixteen\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the cruise or work Senate race in Texas for a while there is a lot of social media engagement around that race\nAnd there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course that's\nBeen a a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were trying to um exacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S they are\nAnd I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct but\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you advocate that university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\n... and more about how it's distributed is the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative or one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify the sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I just want to ask you about the the news today the department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\n[noise] I think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually one of the same\nAnd the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr
