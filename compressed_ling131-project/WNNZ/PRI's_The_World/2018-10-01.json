E. P. R. dot net and thank you\n\nI'm Mark a woman and you're with the world our next story on the show is not strictly speaking about science but it is about how the science behind Google Earth and satellite imagery helped advance the investigation into an atrocity committed a few years ago more on the science and the investigation in a moment the story begins\nAs I said with an atrocity [laughter] this is a moment from a video that went viral this summer and it's killing is about to take place soldiers are walking to prisoners down the road you can just about here one of the soldiers whistling while a comrade is filming and commenting\nOn a lot [noise] you know ... plus\nThe prisoners are two women plus a young child and a baby [noise]\nTwenty two shots were fired in all the women and the children were killed\nBut it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance a guess might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it\nThen a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work\nAnd thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in on not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody\nTell me a lot of people the b._b._c. Africa's security correspondent joins us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case\n[noise] well I think first of all there was just the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other would defend research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is it's anybody have any idea\nWhat the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a foot on the investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean the parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched with many heads put to get that one of them was ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAlso when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms\nListening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was Camry when this was northern capital of course that's also a vast\nRegion but over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video that sets and distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those rich lines matching them to Google or digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location\nThat's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only rich line that has that shape and all of camera room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was easy bought\nThe ... so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed was it was when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that un adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also work with Ellen cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff um how did you figure out who was responsible [noise] well\nFirst of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said you know or the uniform on was not watch\nUm the the soldiers would wear up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nBoy indeed communion military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify and and co found that those were Kembrew Indian soldiers but then in the dialogue as well some of the soldiers was saying each other's names one of them was was referred to as Churchill or another one is called sign guy but\nAround the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed their tone and said well they had the rest it said and people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nOf your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier called ... and apart from just his Facebook you know we found a way will to speak to a former congressman soldier who also confirmed that this wasn't the Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to to be a woman as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and there's a point where\nI Am I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tells us child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and um basically saying it's it's the parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers in affording these women and children any any\nAccess to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYou know I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback or to this investigation has the b._b._c. Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and Nigeria itself [noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nResponding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by the message\nYou know the location the use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the angle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a camera and people in particular but I've been calling for more to be done to hold the government and their forces accountable\nVideo or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the others on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen it festivals even believe that that happened and and and the shock\nAnd it's something you can't really you race from your from your mind so uh it's not something easy to watch\nFrom El Paso which I think the closest city there's not a lot of vegetation is you know kind of think that ... really speak for themselves there's rows and rows of those tents that are that children living quarters or they have a couple other facilities onsite dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that the large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from the facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for thirty chimed so much more of a home the environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learned some English the also\nHave regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or possibly route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have you know the attention that they need and the access that they need to you and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out of this emergency just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education and the kids you know we were told the kids get work bucks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of mount mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really ad hoc\nIt's really the onus is on the child to to ask for it by you know they've just been transition there from a different way\nScreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and small ones farm certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst with a farm standard for sixteen bay road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nDifficult in those situations coupled with being with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids um and it's quite stabilizing\nYeah amend my mind kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um [noise] you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know no you're right presentation on they receive screening\nAnd so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues [noise]\nUm you know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the ... facility and you know the access to legal services has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we had a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection\nIn this country we have that in place [noise] you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment and stuff and there's a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff or those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process isn't work because it's so slow or oh the process\nDoesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic\nLack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not it probably is not a long time it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful and the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of news it certainly to different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously\nIt's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to finding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and save sponsors as soon as possible\nTrouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much President Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months one\nOf the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government\nBy access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen it happening for Lucy's a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa or for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services\nThat included healthcare Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with\nFamilies deciding to descend roll from these vital services just\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you other western ... offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nAnd like snap and even wake or the women infants and children program\nAnd four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages that parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for so it's a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so\nAs recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nAnd so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed our food assistance but she declined\nI'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S so I worry about this baby and many babies and similar situation to starting their lives without all of the support\nThat they could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice from the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just a medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately of an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance 'em and other services that actually allowed them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDoctors on rifle lose a

Africa security correspondent joins us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually crack this case\n[noise] well I think first of all there was just the the shock\nThat gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just conversations across to each other would defend research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is it's anybody have any idea\nWhat the what the terrain hum links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a full on investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology play in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean there are parts of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across west in Central Africa a botched with many heads put together a one of them was Amnesty International their rights\nStreaming

also when people when you listen to the video and you know looking at the uniforms\nListening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern\nCameroon of course that's also a vast region but over time trying to match the topography as you could see in the video that sets an distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those reach lines\nMatching them to Google a digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how you know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that rich line match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shape and all of camera room\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was easy but there were so many clues put together so it's not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clue you sort of bring them together\nAnd that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed lessons when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that and adding everything together so it's it's something that took\nQuite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with selling cat the open source research group which is seriously experience in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible\n[noise] well first of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said you know or the uniform on was not what\nI'm ... the soldiers would way up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to communion soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the kind of Indian Army will serve on some of the the uniforms\nWere indeed ... military uniforms and and so we were able to\nTo festival identify an ankle found that those ... million soldiers but then in the dialogue is well some of the soldiers was saying each other's names one of them was was referred to us Cho or another one is called sign guy but\nAround the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the ... and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they changed the tone and said well they had arrested said and people in in relation to this video\nAnd ... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of them named nicknames but on the on the official list they had no official names and so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details\nYeah you're not out of your parents still you know you've found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier colds ... and apart from just his Facebook you know we found a way to speak to a former kind of ruined young soldier who also confirmed that this was indeed Joe Joe so somebody who who knew him\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to [noise] to these are women as Boko Haram so saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram and there's a point where I Am\nI'm One of the soldiers sort of a tells this child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and um basically saying it's it's your parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so you know the soldiers in forwarding these women and children any any\nAccess to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute what they consider justice on the spot\nYeah I guess we'll see how many crimes like this are are invisible what kind of feedback or to this investigation has a BBC Africa gotten from the public like from Cameroon and no jury itself

four one three valleys solar dot solar weld\nResponding to this and saying you know well done on the work\nBut I think one thing that people are most fascinated by is the message you know the location that use of mathematical calculations calculating for example you know the\nAngle of the sun and using that versus the length of a shadow and using that to tell what time when exactly this happened so those kinds of things have really I'm really fired up the audiences\nI'm so there's been a lot of praise for that and a lot of people hoping that more can come out a cameraman and people in particular have been calling for more to be done to hold the government and their forces accountable\nVideo or you have to say is very disturbing how're you doing and the other is on the investigative team\nUm it's it's not an easy video to uh to watch um [noise] you know it's it's it's difficult to you know once you've seen at festivals even believe that that's happened and and and the shock\nOther facilities on site dining facilities and the like but\nBut it you know it is remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does the do the\nYou know let's say that a child was moved from the facility where they were maybe thirty bad a capacity for each other and so much more of a home the environment they have access to education so they'll receive some kind of classroom instruction and basic\nYou know basic subjects learned some English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support psychologist a lot of these children are suffering or you know I may have experienced some kind of trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving\nAnd or possibly in route and so\nAnd so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access that they need to you and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like turning out emergency just already we see that um you know there isn't the same provision for education and the kids you know we were told the kids get work bucks but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of mountain mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really hot\nIt's really the onus has been on the child to to ask for it but you know they've just been transition there from a different ... and they don't know anyone there just aren't\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by Ewan bay path university graduate schools MS and applied

think\nYou're a member mind kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help if they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the permanent shelters are provided with an you know no you're right presentation um they receive screening\nAnd so in some cases some of the children are able to get legal support through those avenues um\nYou know because the children are transferred from other facilities to turn into you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that tornado I'm at the camp facility and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix it um how do you respond to the\nShow I mean I think we have a system we have a a protection system in place a lot of these kids are seeking protection in this country we have that in place [noise] you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment and stuff and there's a huge backlog of cases we need more immigration judges more support staff\nOr those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the process doesn't work because it's so slow or older process doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in a system\nWe we need to prioritize getting kids out of getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just not a ... it's not a long time it's not a good solution we need to get kids out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um or are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I I Am hopeful in the sense that I think I'm I'm I'm\nYou know the public is engaged on this issue I think I'm Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know\nDoing a lot of it certainly is a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from from a rival to the immigration courts and so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm\nObviously it's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to funding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children to appropriate and safe sponsor and as soon as possible\nTrouble as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time well thank you very much\nPresident Trump crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months\nOne of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change would essentially mean that anyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charge of the government\nBy access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card\nAdvocates fear this could lead to families here in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for loosely says she's already seen it happening but loosely the pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics\nSo this proposed rule is a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa or for permanent residency\nSo what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice\nTo either keep yourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also called food stamps or forego those vital services that included healthcare and Nutrition Assistance or your family can remain together in this country\nSo really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to childhood family health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with\nFamilies deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you other western ... offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nWomen infants and children program and four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which\nIs nearly four hundred and fifty pages that parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs that they qualify for since a very confusing and scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you couldn't tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say the one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as last week I cared for baby who was only four days old\nAnd as many new moms and the mom was motivated to breastfeed what was having a difficult time doing so and she's also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom\nI'm so they usually do I talked about the many benefits of federal programs that provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she'd heard that it could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S\nSo I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support\nThat they can get if their families were not being place in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months that I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and a pause and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between either\nStability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice for the message that immigrant families are hearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so\nWhich which really is a lifeline for a lot of my family they would not be able to afford the preventive care the specialty care that dental care that all kids need if they didn't have Medicaid and includes programs like snap or food stamps that\nProvides healthy foods and includes housing assistance 'em and other services that actually allow them to be healthy and stable so that they can contribute to the United states to our economy to our society\nDr lawn rifle lose a pediatrician in
