United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the chow go on column and the economy is so big question David here is it's a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even wants to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what\nAmerica wants bought it used to be just a few hard line is here in Beijing who saw that America actually\nCouldn't be negotiated with that America wanted to contain China and still China's rise that fringe of hard line is is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look at the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints they look at how Donald Trump\nIsn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just so they were poised to become a kind

retired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was all the records icon to name him but he was a kind of household name in his day and he comes to ... for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump the times about China when I was in D.C by kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there's something to this the\nThe problem is that the machine and Washington has kind of systematic structural things today wants China to do differently to play by the rules to try and\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nI think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think if you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents and America's administrations were too dumb and to kind of kindly to charge enough rent\nTo the rest of the world to access to that market and so it's like you know Donald Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states\nAnd it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table\nBut there isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a lot more rent by I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right\nNow what is China's vision for the world\nSo he's a really interesting thing the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China China is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be\nOne of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nTo go how they get that is not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy ... try another if there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of cross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and\nFor a long time they gave me the world trading system and and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months several trade tensions and you get this when he took the European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike more than an American led worlds trading older is no rules a tool\nAnd so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they don't want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are quite in the order of reforming the company's CEO and no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all these kind of\nThere's always moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive come as of this the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces could feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr an absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because reason to be seen in Chinese officials are now\nWorking their way down the list of people can explain to them and they got so low down the list there are also people like me and I have conversations with what I say I'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all skiing everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap would tell us what that is and how the Chinese said\nShe says this was an ancient Greek historian heroes about when you had a very militaristic rising power sponsor coming up against the status quo wealthy paw Athens it ended up inevitably the war and so he's been analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe status quo power finds itself being challenged by an upstart\nAnd in a depressing number of cases that does triggered armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to solve the Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time for trade will let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is a particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of the phone from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy [noise]\nUm so I think that as people it shouldn't go to war but the dynamics can get a bit of weight from you when you've got these two big big countries\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op

... and there was this extraordinary and gold and Trump said I think it was at the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous president said should've been ready towards China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch\nThat wasn't going to happen quite so soon that's really extraordinary statement and you know previous American presidents said you know

older still remembers making a comeback as Brazil's president ... seats up\nFor example we had a real more about the last candidate being the creator of something called ... which is supposed to be an

political candidate like the charge a gyro both in our own launch those yeah that'll legitimate claim\nThis is a rule more from two thousand twelve inches to up in the website or the right wing candidate\nHe created this a false information he was a a a member of the the Congress so he took this issue to the Congress and several Congress person that are religious they supported him in the story and this became a monster\nBoth in our was also accused of creating another monster a big one last week a Brazilian newspaper reporter that the right wing candidate was working with local marketing firms to buy a bundle of phone numbers and use them to mask text propaganda to Brazilians through what's up\nBrazilian authorities are investigating those claims in the meantime people like you also do record of a are trying to put out the flames before they turn into a fake news wildfire in Brazil\nWhat's very interesting is that as far as I've seen of what's on the news in this information\nThere is no story that is not in both platforms Facebook and ... what we see different types of presentations so\nWhen ... you have an all you see like there's this thing happening you have to act so there's a call to action that's very strong shared days otherwise our country is going to be a Venezuelan five years share this to save our country\nStuff like this\nOn Facebook you

there's an entire system if you look just to watch that ah we're not getting all the picture\nI mean I'm a I don't want to suggest that Brazil is different from any other place in the world but I mean is there a kind of a cultural thing here with the contagion of these these fake news stories\nYes we have a a social and economic component that need to be taken into account when you talk about fake
