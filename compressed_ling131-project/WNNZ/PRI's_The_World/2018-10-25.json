have no power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in his government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's hon people that live in this province who've lived there for decades those people that are from this older group many of them grew up with leaders in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWhere populations were polarized an extreme way and all speech in action was politicized so there's a lot of concern there from this older group\nThe newer group of people that I met people that it came to the province more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pin that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nThey also seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders\nLike in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first\nSo it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kinda enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances echoes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they train their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance and then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society\nSo their position is really quite fraught and precarious\nDarren ... is an anthropology professor at the University of Washington Thank you very much for being with us darn it was my pleasure [noise]\nKind of
