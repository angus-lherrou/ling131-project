took off from the buccaneer cause and drown in Kazakhstan at\nFour forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that something had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up in flight and that\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in at a much steeper angle when you land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth's gravity so pretty intense flight um but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and I believe they're about\nThirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlifting that's what you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to do with the fact that there were no longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the ballistic re entry and then they're parachutes deployed\nTo slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the person\nThey are [laughter] God I've\nDone what is known as the parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment to time and during the ... experience extra cheese and

Soyuz rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNow the U.S and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope and our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter no it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has\nHad an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to an asset we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at the moment because this way is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the Asians teacher we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and orbit they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that to January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLearned brushes senior science reporter for the

Ontario\nThis week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian constantly in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what happened to hand\nSide to side um it is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new ... my camp she lives outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on for the past few years have been put in place then taken from different countries and brought back at the Saudi Arabia\nAnd so ... the highest profile of something that's been going on ... for more than ... let's say and I think\nThat's what I thought I'd tell us again what happened to you after you produce a documentary\nThat the government officially accused me of supporting carrot\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses an firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nIndependent journalists because there isn't anything called the dependent journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like a for a lot of people even what I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi dissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering the story\nBut because there is no such platforms inside Saudi Arabia where you can say these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this was the problem with\nWith with how the Saudi Government is dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even the ... of comments and critique about\nTheir policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and then they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman um came\nI Can't lose her absolutely on everyone just what I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia\nDo everything started off completely normal they took off from the buccaneer cause me drown in Kazakhstan at four forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into flight we got indication that\nSomething had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up in flight and that\nInitiated the emergency abort sequence and the capsule that they were writing on performed what's known as a ballistic reentry and that's when you come in and much steeper angle when you land on earth\nSo I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which is seven times earth gravity so pretty intense flight but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and ultimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and\nI Believe there are about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there the astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer connected with the booster and then at that point they start spinning and the goal is to a grand jury and then they're parachutes deployed\nTo slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the first one yeah they are [laughter] God I've done what is known as the parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment this time and during the ... experience extra jeeze and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nSo here's two years offering a structural presumably a long term storage and his baby overturning of shuttered December first grab your tickets no good for your [noise]\nYour field so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nAre there any new details about what might have caused this problem\nI don't know if they've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but\nRussia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters and us in our core we're\nWhen really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular sway as rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter] I don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nThe U.S and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope and our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics inter now it definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our space infrastructure but when it comes to an asset we just can't let those things get in a way we need then at\nThe moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting away of that\nIs a significant setback for the international space station\nI Would say it's definitely concerning about the nation's teacher we currently have three astronauts\nInto orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a few hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days\nInto that so there are slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that the January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down soon or Russia could possibly launch an empty Soyuz capsule and then that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren brushes senior science reporter for the verge thanks learn
