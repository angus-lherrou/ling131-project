R. dot net to get started\n\nI'm Mark a woman and this is the world\nFor a platform that was supposed to build community has become pretty clear over the past few years at Facebook's communities have some problems hate speech disinformation fake news\nThese problems don't just live on line this spill into the real world and they have serious consequences our colleagues that front line here at W. GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world\nThey're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week we want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nRedeemed any patriotic solely on line the sponsoring highland meant candidate so fans from ancient person that just change democracy and where our lives are prevalent [noise] plenty licensure\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much do they interact with each other by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing and that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a the the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs a big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines in terms of that does their digital lives\nSo Maria ... so we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the story that uh occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so\nHappened is Facebook actually offered a lot\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nHarness the power the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports after he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're disseminating all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people [noise]\nSo uh on Maria rest so uh that this activist and she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook the tension in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and Marie arrest so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nNo\nI think baseball one day and they were focused on or what they didn't realize is that countries like [noise] continue sway institutions are clear corruption is rampant [laughter] you don't see\nWhen you bring everyone onto a platform and June ... any kind of rules if you don't have those rules for getting wine country chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggest you know hiring her as a fact checker ... does that suggest Facebook is going to pursue and due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole\nI think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that\nWhere your rent restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook yeah [noise]\nUm if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and\nThe the big question would you rate several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation fake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at the age cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here\nBecause there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in this position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know\nBut as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic a says in your dog and it's really was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now well we've got our mid term election\nWe have so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first to the hotel north happen you're glad rigs zone or get your ticket today at NPR does matter\nWhether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media\nPolarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world view is that the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what they are they're collecting around you um but uh it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC um says I think one of the most important in lines which is\nWhat are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention but it is so problematic so ... what are you gonna do\nAnd she should I Would argue no better but yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down a lemon juice preying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza into Israel I ... which I think also shows like a disconnect and a complete myth understanding of history\nYeah I mean not totally Bennett also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S a run ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWanted the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and those and to be anti Semite so usually not neo Nazis on college campuses they're promising the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's civil rights or whether it's on single life yeah\nI think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from whole support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better I think these important Israeli due to the Trump support Israel in the trunk of strong Israel so and ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDue to tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of ... percent the shock and I are the kind of quickly\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western ... offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nJewish community they don't fully understand the place of synagogue life for American Jews they don't understand that for American Jews the synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share threat that a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from where all hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most was the story of\nJerry Ruben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who are murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that when he was shot\nAnd and as an immoral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders caught it which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the cash and that is traditionally a time it only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one day there will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who I've known to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood\nUp and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing out to that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their just unity\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among the child that they find it in the walls at a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere let me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't you there and you can pass right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support\nRights for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which is\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once a stranger in Egypt and so\nThere's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly well for themselves and in America I'm and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews steel\nFeel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic has Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in this sort of zero sum game it time you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm stress from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically and somebody's highlights those splintered\nReporter dinner crops with Haaretz in Tel Aviv

out pace the capacity of the call themselves to adopt\nRoof gates died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientist to make the connection between coral bleaching on global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools and as a creative non fiction writing enrolling no for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nCorals did this strange pay lanes and she was able to tie it to warming and at that time we were just starting to understand what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia wife says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up around and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking just to them she had\nThis wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of coral and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an iconic closet or feel why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals to very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster\nTo be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try upper righty options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know but personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she\nDisliked pushing your colleagues decided to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world at coral science\nA more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help coral reefs are in the face of the past few years several major Corey bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I mean coral reefs are expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWow at such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like\nYou know we can throw her hands up and give up or we can look for solutions than I think her enthusiasm really instilled that\nSame passion and a lot of other people\n[noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] her laugh\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that failed the round people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean general and she laughed she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State university and a

S. you're automatically a citizen it's not clear if he can do that the concept is enshrined in an amendment to the U.S constitution for the president told Axios he could do away with it unilaterally\nYou can definitely do with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just was an executive order\nMartha Jones is a professor at Johns Hopkins university the author of birthright citizens a history of race and rights so this is all tied into the fourteenth amendment and there was an interesting history behind that could could you talk about what went into forming a\nShort the fourteenth amendment comes into being in the aftermath of the U.S civil war for a million plus former slaves are now free people and the question is who will they be in a formal constitutional sense with respect to the nation\nThe fourteenth amendment declares them to be birthright citizens but it goes further of course because it extends beyond former slaves to all persons born in the United states making them citizens that the United states [noise]\nSo let's talk about that a more in a moment um because it's all part of of your research but it's just getting to the president's for what we're looking at today or a prior case that's came close to defining or interpreting this from the Supreme Court\nThe most important case for thinking about this question is that of a gentleman named Juan Kim arc\nUm they've just decided by the Supreme Court and Eighteen Ninety eight one Kim ark is born in the United states um his parents are Chinese immigrants\nWho cannot become citizens of the United states because of the existing Chinese exclusion acts of the period but long himself himself to be a citizen because he was born in the United states he\nLeaves states to do business in China\nAbsolutely they're helping I notice [laughter] I Know this because they follow me on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and they sent me messages I Know this because if it weren't for the generosity of all these people including Jews who know a lot about homeland\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches\nDot com you know at a time like this I have to believe in love I have to believe in the generosity of people I have to believe that we don't struggle alone I Would argue that after this horrific horrific\nTragedy I bet you that more people are going to be more willing to help\nWith Antonio Banderas his new book is called dear America notes of an undocumented citizen okay thank you\nThank you so much for having me [noise]\nWe have ... always full interview with Vargas by the way as a world dot O.

GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing on PBS this week\nWe want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nRedeemed any patriotic folding on line snakes sponsoring he and his name is hiring men picking Kennedy says this information that just change democracy and we're allies are prevalent [noise] way lighter truth\nFront lines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studios thanks for coming by James thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and how much did they interact with each other and by the up\nWhile it's remarkable the story Facebook and Southeast Asia is amazing that they pushed aggressively into south east Asia and to Philippines and demand more other countries\nAnd they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to\nUse data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety and a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and Maria wrestler who who's a ... that the woman were interviewing in the film from the Philippines who runs the big news organization there she\nTalks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is their public space in the Philippines um in terms of the the ... their digital lives\nSo Maria right so we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on the store that ah occurred in Myanmar where fake news actually led to the violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so what\nHappened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to deter today a during his campaign for president and helped him to really harness\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and de path university graduate schools and as a in creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nAnd as Maria wrestle reports after he was elected he essentially weaponized it by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling he had\nA network of fake accounts and paid followers that we're descending all sorts of lies about his policies and also going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria rats or a ... this activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook's attention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between new James and ... so\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting\nNo\nI think one day and they were focused on what what they didn't realize is that countries like [noise] continuously commissions are clear corruption is ran these companies don't dying\nWhen you bring everyone onto him not informed and Julie I exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't implement those rules for getting wind and chaos\nSo James what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria Russia's complaints\nWell Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one they said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently in as a as I think it was an April Facebook is paying Murray arrest US Organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral on Facebook in the Philippines but as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there\nDoes that suggests you know hiring her as a fact checker does that suggest Facebook is kind of pursuing due diligence or they were just trying to plug\nThe hole I think that that there are fact checking project that they are trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation to have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in\nThe home country or in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it and what's also fascinated about it is that where your rent restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook\nYeah [noise] um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are closely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and\nThe the big question would you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's information fake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at age ... for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what the standard for success here because there is no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever\nIt is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah says in your dog and it's really a was a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that have been in ... where that is most evident right now\nWell we've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know the the horrific events here of the past week and scenes\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThese are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and filter bubbles are are a real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world view is that the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it\nI I'm On it I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what they are they're collecting around you um but uh it's just um [noise]\nYeah I'm I'm torn and sign up to ... who's in the film was a scholar at UNC\nUm says I think one of the most important in lines which is what are you going to do about the fact that all your friends and family are there it's this tremendous thing to be able to communicate with people it really is an amazing invention but it is so problematic so ... what are you gonna do\nAnd she should I Would argue no better but yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down eleven Jews praying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza into Israel I ... which I think also shows like a disconnect completeness understanding of history\nYeah I mean not totally Bennett also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the U.S Ron ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWanted the big forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and knows and have an anti Semite so usually not me not being on college campuses they're promising the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's on civil rights or whether it's on single life yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli Jews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America\nI think a lot of Israeli Jews as we know from hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much better domestic policies they don't really know very much better domestic these important on Israeli Jews and the Trump support Israel and to try to put the strong Israel so and ... comments I think perplexed American Jews more than they do Israeli Jews\nDue to tell me a bit about reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nOver all although there has been expressions of condolence to expressions of shocking to hire ... did you kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact that has had on the American Jewish community they don't\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the past university graduate schools MS and applied data ... enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay pest dot edu\nOr American Jews in synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school\nWhere they hide as I did like you know hiding out from from Hebrew school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would play kind of come of age and that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I ... a share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from real hell and I'm\nOne of the stories that move me most of the story of Jerry\nRuben ... sixty six years old he was one of the eleven people who are murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise we don't know if you knew it was gunfire at that point to go help and that is when he was shot\nAnd and after the memorial in Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this interesting custom dream orders ... which is the Jewish prayer memorial I think the dead and it's set in every single service\nHe stood up he always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time it only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why did he stand up every single time he said well I have no children so one\nDay there will be nobody to stand for me so I stand for all of those who I've known to stand for them and on Saturday everybody stood up and stood for Jerry in in his memory and I think um\nThat standing out to that standing up together is such a metaphor and I think overall Israeli Jews and Israeli in general they don't need a synagogue given Jewish community because they had their Jewish community\nWithin their own lives and and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community if they want to hide a sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the walls at a synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't connect\nDo you know the president does reveal a quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere let me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and Israeli Jews aren't you there and you can pass right now I Would say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves very much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rights for immigrants they tend to very much for leaving the Senate that's repeated in the Bible more than any other tenant which is\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to acknowledge that you know American Jews have done fairly well to themselves and in America I'm and feel fairly successful and feel very comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens them to sort of\nBe more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews still feel under attack they feel very much sort of\nThe product of sort of post traumatic pose Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much and that sort of zero sum game it time you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know\nI'm fresh from within somehow an Israeli the trend toward sort of like circling the wagons in fear and American jury you have a trend sort of towards plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think you should those divisions coming more clearly now and Pittsburgh\nAttach tragically in some ways highlights those splintered\nReporter dinner cropped with Haaretz in Tel Aviv she's also the host of the podcast the branch Dina thanks very much for your time thank you\n... ...\n...\n... ... ... ...\nAnd her life roof gates earned a reputation as a passionate defender of coral reefs\nAnd when you look at organisms and um you look at a coral reef clearly we're losing more coral than we would hope and that means the rate of change in the environment of essentially I'll have the capacity of the call themselves to adopt\nRuth ... died last week at the age of fifty six months after being diagnosed with brain cancer longtime friend and collaborator Virginia was so gates was one of the very first scientists to make the connection between coral bleaching on global warming\nShe started in the Nineteen eighties in the very early days when none of us understood what was going on she was able to show that corals did this strange pay lanes\n[noise] we had so much for last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north helping your blood red zone or get your tickets today at NPR are done minutes\nAnd what global warming was\nOver the years gates became a bowl of teacher and an eternal optimist in a field whose future looks grim until her death gates led a research lab at the University of Hawaii that's trying to figure out ways to help coral adapt to warming oceans friend Virginia was says she was also a regular and vibrant public speaker\nI don't remember her ability to light up around and make everyone in the room feel like she's talking jets to them she had\nThis wonderful silky highbrow English accent that she joked with her secret weapon and she was able to tell the story of coral and she was brilliant at it she really excelled at it\nI Know you've described her as an icon of clubs centerfield why\nSo she was and I kind of class and a couple of different ways the best one to think about right now is this idea of assisted evolution of corals to very controversial it's the idea that humans need the help corals evolve faster\nTo be able to tolerate the heating that's happening and some scientists really think that that's not our place to do that and but others led by roots really feel that we need to try upper righty options\nShe's the first to admit it may not work but if you don't try it then we can't know\nBut personally I feel very strongly she was an iconoclast in terms of the way she approached science she disliked pushing your colleagues decided to get ahead and she was much more about cooperation and encouraging\nAll diversity brown people and women and because of that sometimes she ruffled feathers but she ruffled feathers to make the world of coral science a more inclusive cooperative place\nSuch determination to help coal raise in the face of the past few years several major coral reef bleaching events and the rest of the news isn't good I mean Karl reserve expected to be almost completely destroyed in coming decades\nAnd yet Rick Gates remained so optimistic how did she retained that optimism all studying something so depressing\nWow at such a great question mark how I think all of us are trying to bottle that um especially in light of her life she just looked forward and she felt like you know we control our hands up and give up or we can look for solutions\nThan I think her enthusiasm really instilled that same passion\nAnd a lot of other people [noise] what is the one memory of Virginia that you'll always hang onto about Rick Gates\n[noise] her laugh [laughter]\nYou know she was not a big person but she had this huge laugh that field around people in restaurants would turn around and stare I mean general and she laughed she left early and often and it was infectious\nVirginia was a biology professor at Oregon State University in a long time friend and colleague of coral
