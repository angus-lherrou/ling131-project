Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality cop show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who were\nWorking in terms of over a reason Japan mistake people you're there with them in the car um they capture them in surrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggested to forward to in the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called the ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a ... ... which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot

the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's it's it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton cousin so now the the immigration agents are on their way to be\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers

driving down the road and it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably complain and ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurred out images you can't see people's faces voices are disguised as quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is in a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be a because uh the the program did to cooperate with the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl so\nThey I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources\nI'd assumed is going to be somewhere PR efforts like this too\nI gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\n[noise] well I mean yeah at least on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism or movements and so yeah they they basically said why you're turning this into the entertainment\nLike why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like ... the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess they'd be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about uh people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I Am sure like uh I think it's just kind of a ... sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump\nFor Brexit or\nInvasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country is so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some

I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime the Saudis are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways there's no full now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ... one\nOf the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his ... which\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical X but I'm the photos that were released of the fifty and Saudis who are being accused of being scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams in Neal and they were checking us to do is to try and match them with\nOpen source material social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by us all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nCrash of uh the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mom had been so on so called on um you know photograph news agency photograph so those are the things we able to match up there are others that it's difficult to walk out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is a reporter to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went arrive in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think for us we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on a new one this was a very brazen attack gun so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against their own government and parts of the Audubon himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which overload the certain diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable differences\nAnd so now you see in the program columnist quite a lot of anger spilling out a particularly on demands that um the crown prince be removed so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall the New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us\nPleasure to meet with him\nMm\n\nHurricane Michael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places that took a direct hit tend to air force base in Florida to know just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impacts of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise] is it ... medal favorites outfit building for safe and one through the air in ... like ...

with it\nBecause they proceed migrants invaders but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge an equally and as I say ... any support that there is a dish should but then

school meals the kids but she said that she doesn't have to drop the resolution\nGuardian reporter Lorenzo tone to thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know the show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show\nIn this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess these over stairs or people who were working against the terms of of a reason Japan mistake people you're there with him in the car\nUm they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of this show suggests to deport him in the next plane type bang\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or a translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called the ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment the deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a ... ... which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this that kind of the border services agency cooperated with with the producers and actually the beginning government funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrant\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on and get your tickets today at NPR done net\nWhat is the tone of the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening it's just it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in Brighton cousin so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory where some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of hiding out is going to be this sort of narrative\nAnd say it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there is a a camera you know you're driving down the road ... it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations\nYou can't really show anybody's face so everything is blurt out including the like the neighborhood where it is because like like say if you show the neighborhood\nOr the people who live there would probably complain in ... create a slash and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's spaces voices are disguised as quite an odd courtroom\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is it a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be um because uh the the program did to cooperate with ah the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they I mean there's people who put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to an immigration agency and get more resources I'd assume is going to be some work PR efforts like this too\nI I gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan what have active it's been saying [noise] well\nI mean yeah at least on line there was considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant anti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said ... entertainment like why why you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um be the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of cars I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it would be the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and in taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think it's just a kind of a ... sensational kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place and they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing [laughter]\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live in a time when around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump\nFor Brexit or\nInvasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country and so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that someone is doing something to protect us here\nAnd I've been
