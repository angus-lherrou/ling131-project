intelligence\nEric Holder is one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to

his real name is Alex and their skin but before he was ... and then as Alex in Petra which was his coverage that it was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere\nFor him to travel on 'em and

tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ on before he went to medical school [laughter] yeah he was he a DJ at the local clubs one club I'm sure they had in a tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think we're probably max the true identity of Michigan\nI gotta say some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this is just a lot of very creative thinking\nThinking of a mini vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia right so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information has had no way forever but again these guys have real lives to they have a family they have kids so you can find information that we tracked back to them so\nYeah I mean yes maybe some of this is kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for any interesting details in cross referencing them and see what's on your matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address like on his driver's license to address the you know ... the equivalent of the CIA\nWell he did it because I'm you know if it gets pulled over in his car the cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and you can just go you know you're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found there's three hundred and five men\nAll between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nYou all have the same registered address or just says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration address who they just don't wanna pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over for drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the owner abilities of how we're able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy in us but intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation and the information I Russia people always chime in and saying well they want you to find it very well if\nThey want us to find out why is no one published to stop this war because you know these insurance ... his eagles field and the jury you headquarters [noise] you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years

as going online and doing a few searches\nThe investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did boats and in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G R U Russian Army intelligence\nEric Holder is one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex ... but before he was ... minutes Alex in Petra which was his cover it and it was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere\nFor him to travel and um and so we had some information about that cover identity including his birthday um where he had to pass password issue too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise]\nI'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably\nUse some of the same information discover identity from Israel I get so we looked into a bunch of databases some of them are openly available some of them are leaked um Russia is a very corrupt and leaky society and because of that they're just leak the databases\nFrom driver's licenses and ensure and stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find if you just know where to look yes we cross referenced everything we can try and we found the max\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and

digging including actually sending someone to go to this tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ before he went to medical school yeah he was he a DJ at a local club the one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think would probably match the true identity of Michigan\nI go to say some of the steps in in your process uh you and your investigators really seem to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this as a lot of very creative thinking\nThinking of on any vulnerabilities of what would leave a paper trail from a spy and Russia right so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information is hidden away forever but again these spies have realized too they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to them so yeah I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot of very very basic routine research on this stuff you learned and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details and cross referencing them and see what's that matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the ... which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address like on his driver's license to address the you know the I ... the equivalent of the CIA\nWell he did it because uh you know if you get pulled over and his car\nTo cop pulls up and address and he sees the address of the you know the Russians CIA more or less and he's like oh actually no everything's me up and up you can just go you know you're fine so um that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found is three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nWho all have the same register to address that gift says one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address who's I guess I Want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get hold of her drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services so really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because we know every time any investigation ... Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if\nThey want us to find out why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance registrations for these eagles and the jury you headquarters [noise] you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new agencies address same like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website building cat identified as a second person allegedly involved with this great ball poisoning I have is already in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] um no no no not really at all I mean I don't really have any and I don't think Elliot our founder has any contacts with UK police either [noise] um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news than we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spy in the digital age\nIt depends I I I get I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked in the intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site a bell and cats together with their partners that the insider and they say they've uncovered the identities of two Russian intelligence officers suspected of poisoning former Russian sought Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the u._k. back in March and\n[noise]\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land a western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "city": "Westfield", "day": "09"}
