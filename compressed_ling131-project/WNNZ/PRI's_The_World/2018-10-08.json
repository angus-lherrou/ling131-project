Bangladesh been pushing for this one point five degree target for a long time\nWould say they're happy that it's still technically feasible to reach that and also that this report that so thoroughly documented the differences in real human experience between one point five degrees and two degrees will help focused even more on that more ambitious target\nWhich I'll do it would be very difficult to reach I think that increased focus would be seen as a positive by a lot of people\n[noise] the world's Carolyn Beeler there the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in economics or to American scholars who make connections between climate change and economic growth\nThe royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that William Nord house and Paul Romer were picked for their work on the most basic impressing economic issues of our age\nNord houses a pioneer in environmental economics he started warning policymakers in the Nineteen seventies that their economic models were failing to take the impact of climate change into account\nNew York university professor Paul Romer helped create the modern approach to understanding innovation and how it relates to economic growth\nHe joins us now from NYU Stern school of business are first of all professor congratulations I have you had a chance to speak out with your fellow winner William nor does\nNo I haven't I just wrote one of his but like a nephew hoping that I can find out how to get in touch with Bill it's really a terrific honor to be linked together with him he's just a great scholar and exceptional lead decent guy couldn't ask for better association\nSo your work is linked to the work of Dr Norton house how would you describe your work\nWe're both interested in\nNot the kind of trade off that's common and economics like we can use this field to produce a little more corn or a little more wheat what Bill and I were focused on is the huge gains that can come from discovering new things the real source of progress for humans\nHas been the discovery of new ideas that gives you more of both corn and wheat\nSo that's the unifying element\nIn what we do [noise] you know we have our own different specialization bill is really the one who's focusing explosively on climate change but you know very supportive that work and I firmly persuaded that the real key to addressing the ... of the energy system will be\nTechnological progress and the key to policy right now should be to encourage this amazing machines for discovery we have in the modern economy just encourage that to go tackle history important problem\nSo it sounds like your body of research looks at the discovery of new things part of technology can you talk about how that overlaps with the work of Dr ... with climate change\n[noise] there's a very simple model that would say something like oh the government supports basic scientific research by giving grants to university professors than the private economy puts that knowledge to work\nProfessors love that story because it involves the government giving money to professor so you know they're they're keen on that but the truth is that most\nStreaming of New England public radio

and firms to go out and try and make a business in this area\nAnd so I think both bill and I would recommend a kind of attacks on\nSay carbon based energy sources\nYou need to use government policy to unleash this machine for discovering which is the modern accounting\nProfessor what's next for you I went to the world bank right after the vote on Brexit but it was a summer funny sixteen\nYep yep that for me was a real red flag there were many things going on there were still trying to understand that part of what was going on I'm sure a lot of people who basically said if the economist or for
