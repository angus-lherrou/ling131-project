S. speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said and mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division\nWas struck by the amount of division in America or may not be traveling here since Nineteen Ninety six tubes of presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that everybody here and there is in their respective camp and\nIt's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp for the ... and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who ... on either side I think there's a sense of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and that just quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a road that I think Americans attacking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been\nExtremely I may pay Trump's support as as I say\nTrump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country you know why that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and then they'll site North Korea is named sample of that the tariffs wars with China on the other side of the coin it's division it's that shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals\nThat people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we were just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little focus group they're primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though John or is not buying they across the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which makes ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we're going to have another habit snakes human not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a coal was kept out why the hip pocket and the as we call it in stride and but you usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in a strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomenon\nIt usually comes with people who were once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left that left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who doubt represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling enhance and she's still around and she ran that particular one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourist dependent electric was voting for her and say you know sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once in a said why did set of keys to Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens [laughter]\nThe question that I think that we're gonna have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well has Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags on and get your tickets today at NPR are done net\nGive him a chance to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue wave that's coming might just be more of a trickle\nHow much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier terrorist and trade how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region [noise] well\nIt depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue and people of color they were very very distressed that I felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American\nWho grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters and restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he'd never seen such ... racism and he's view coming from a president or somebody in such high office\nHe said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but I have never felt this rural or exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to try and we have compulsory ... statement that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fond if we darn but as science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd that of course changes the nature of politics and astray or it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time if you're a pep compulsory biting your politician industry you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's\nThe people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nOr you know we have a national hills game which would never be touched by either the major parties on I think in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I Would do the pot from that that would be the end of their prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists and others that turnout is greater with early voting mental so registration that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'll be very surprised if we can say ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's allegations of vote as a profession\nThat that is how to resist effect and that there's been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump and the priorities that he has and I basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we all worried about it and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is intergenerational dead but they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I Want to be around to see the worst effects of climate change but they will not think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to is it more and more power\nDidn't share the same level of commitment he did so\nBy the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind maybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as leader because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you\nAre also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when that war began is that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success of policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nWell you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end\nThe reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of\nWhat he asked me to do but at a point and news story came out or a media story in Rolling Stone magazine\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it's not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans it probably says ... how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive foot river really defending what we ought to do is put drones out to get targeting and do airstrikes on the migrants convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo however in some ways it is a crisis\nIt's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal

values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid out for me what is your take on the on the ... by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier and values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nAnd we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be what I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWhen I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm I'm at all when you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to but I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other\n[noise]

S. speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said in mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division bullet struck\nBy the amount of division in America or may not been traveling here since Nineteen Ninety six to observe presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that everybody here and there is in their respective camp and\nIt's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp or the other and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story\nAnd I don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think there's this sense of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go\nOn happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what what do you see and it's a disc quiet I think which is permeating American society right now even for people who very strong Trump supporters and we'll probably see themselves as being in the ascendency so that's the hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been\nExtremely I may pay Trump's support as as I say Trump is being somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before\nAnd they believe that he's achieving things and and they'll ... North Korea is an example of that the tariff wars with China and the other side of the coin it's division\nIt's the shouting out it's the singling out of minority groups and individuals that people find very offensive and drives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot EDU\nIn Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conducted little focus group that primarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though China's not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns\nThat were prepared to give Donald Trump a chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then which make two other ... that is well and good but ... now full and if we can solve this problem out really soon we're going to have another habit snakes she will not going to have anything to do with that\nSo it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal to a coal was kept out why the hip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually motivates what people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like that back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in as strategy we do have something of a Trump phenomena and\nIt usually comes with people who were once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out left behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we had a woman called polling Hansen she still around and she ran a political one nation very populist and\nShe was upsetting Asians and Asian tourists to strike but people in tourists dependent electric with voting for her and say yeah sometimes people vote against their interests I read an article once and it said ... Thanksgiving sometimes that just happens to\nThe question now I think that we're going to have to be asking in two years' time if we come back as well\nHas Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a chance we're going to see how you guys and that may mean that the cycle blue why that's coming might just\nBe more of a trickle how much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier terrorists and trade how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina you cannot get away from rice as an issue and people of color they were very very distressed they felt that that will being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American\nWho grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina had refused admission in the lunch counters and restaurants and\nSort it as roars and he said he had never seen anything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he had never seen such of racism and he's view coming from a president or somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar exposure\nThat's extraordinary Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWill and the strikes have compulsory ... [laughter] that's taken that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fined if we die hard but a science take it for granted really that they have divided on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics ... it means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time\nIf you're ... you're a politician and astray you know that your traditional voters are going to come out and support you it's the people in the middle you have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very divisible times\nStill is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain the major political parties for example\nAh you know we have a national hills scale which would never be touched by either the major parties on anything in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to pot from that that would be the end of the prospects of winning an election\nDo you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools MSA and creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay past dot edu\nDistraction that they Kevin uh issue has motivated and energized democratic voters particularly women\nSo on both sides with saying this remarkable energizing I'll be very surprised if we don't see ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're also getting at reports that in states like Georgia where there's been allegations of vote a suppression\nThat that has had to resist effect and that there is a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there\nAnd one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them well what do you think about Donald Trump in the priority says he has and I basically say\nThat totally out of step with what we are worried about and the number one issue that we get back is climate change because this is the generation that's going to have to deal with these problems and the other is a generational dead\nBut they really do worry about climate and climate change\nAnd you can understand why you know I Want to be around to see the worst effects of climate change but I Will I think that will become a bigger and bigger issue as this generation starts to assert more and more power\nBy the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind maybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as later because you lead these highly classified missions in Iraq that led to most of all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year\nAs soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when the war began is that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success a policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular\nOr you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end the reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of what he\nWe had so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel Northampton get you're glad rags on to get your tickets today at NPR done that\nThat I didn't think was fair but at the same time I'm a commander in Afghanistan and it is not it's my job not to let hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not\nGeneral McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican border uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming or we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins and the idea that we're going to be decisive river really defending what we ought to do is put and drones out to get targeting Hindu airstrikes on the migrant convoy and just stop it\nBefore it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's immoral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing but we shouldn't even\nSend the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the album however in some ways it is a crisis it's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of the number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a pretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras Guatemala\nA lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about putting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here\nIs one of our immigration policy and then America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide what our values are adjust our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all Americans are going to agree\nSo how do you feel our country is being led laid out for me what is your take on the on the tone things up by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expanded beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier in values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nAnd we need to say All right what are our values what do we want from our leaders because I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says wow I Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be\nAn does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nWell I think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question\nI'm Madeleine you dizzy reflect your values general\nI think I just answered that question I don't believe that President Trump reflects the kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to\nBut I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other [noise]\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal his new
