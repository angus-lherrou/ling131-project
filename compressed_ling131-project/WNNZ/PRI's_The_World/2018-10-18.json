that in many ways a sort of a tried to harness the backlash to big money\nRight so one of the popular narratives about Citizens United especially from its critics who started on leashes current campaign cash into the electoral system what do we know about that in terms of the numbers since two thousand ten I mean given it to put put that in perspective for us\nYeah outside spending has increased there's no doubt a it has increased more than just\nThe typical ... increments that we would see you know that it's sort of a cliche every campaign is the most expensive cab paid ever for the midterms are for the presidential that just because of\nYou know the cost to political campaigns that are on the rise and also the the you know inflation so to speak but\nAh but we have seen a disproportionate increase and outside money and just looking right now uh as of the latest figures we see a more than six hundred million dollars having been spent in the mid term by these as these outside groups not all of them are a superPAC some of them are more traditional packed that would have been allowed before Citizens United but\nThat is a a a a big increase over the twenty four team at terms and we're expecting to uh at this stage of the midterms and we're expecting the total number to be much greater\nAnd and who knows in and twenty twenty it will be interesting I think we're sort of at a um\nA a a a an inflection point as far as this dynamic that I talked about where the ease of raising small do a small dollar a contributions on line and this sort of\nBoost that you get rhetorically by being able to say that you are the candidate of small money running against candidates who are beholden to major donors\nDemocrats ... Democrats in particular entering twenty twenty\nOr have a decision to make as to how they're going to run their campaigns and whether they're going to do this preparatory work of cultivating major donors in running a campaign that is\nDependent on early supplemented significantly by a superPAC or whether they're going to turn their back on that I think that will go a lot further towards determining whether\nThe you know how significant the role of big money in our politics is as opposed to\nAny legal changes or any changes like that which could eventually be a which could eventually result from the proposition that you guys are now talking about a Massachusetts\nPretend this is James ... again a step back and get some context or just on the headlines here for the narrative arc let's start with you for just just to get people to get their head around were at in this moment let's start with Nineteen Seventy one the federal election campaign act which of course was leader updated after Watergate in Nineteen Seventy four\nWhere weeds in where did we go with McCain Feingold and we're we now\nIs that uh the the ... federal election campaign act a was a reaction to a lot a lot of these changes by the way our reactions to scandals or a campaign financing scandals or a political corruption scandals\nAnd so Watergate are spurred a lot of the amendments to seek a and some of the the sort of um uh most significant ones were limiting the types of money that are\nPutting limits on how much individuals parties and political committees could give to campaign and also creating this public financing system\nThat campaigns up until President Bush\nUsed to a sort of supplement their fundraising\nEnemy to interrupt you but you don't win over overstepped the importance of ... maybe you can talk now briefly what that meant in terms of the context of the conversation today\n... a Supreme Court decision that basically ruled that money is speech and political spending is speech and so that has been the framework under which all these attempts at reform have had to sort of a a shoe themselves too and not and avoid overstepping so\nYou know what what are the Watergate era forms did was limit a lot of the types of money that could be raised but they importantly left this what is known as soft money avenue in place and not allow political parties\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nFor what was what was sort of euphemistic leading\nParty building activities but will we saw was parties increasingly relying on that to do all manner of things sort of in the same\nWay that super PACs are sort of expanded beyond what they were originally envision this soft money became a critical part of a political fundraising to the point where\nIt accounted for five point two billion dollars worth of the money raised by a political parties between that Watergate between the guy and a two thousand two when we saw McCain fined gold\nOr the a bipartisan campaign reform act passed\nIn two thousand two as a reaction to again scandals\nClinton fundraising scandals where he was\nA um accused of sort of renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to major donors in exchange for soft money contribution to the Democratic National Committee and even to an extent\nThe uh the corporate accounting scandals around Enron uh and and uh WorldCom which ah we had a political fundraising component to them as well\nSo what McCain Feingold tried to do was cut off that soft money a flow and ... as ... as a sort of a a reaction to it we saw some of this big money going instead of going to the party's\nGoing to these outside groups in a way that really weaken the parties and so with Citizens United was sort of further that by allowing this this big money that was going to these outside groups to be used in even more ways\nAnd really diminishing the power of parties further more recently and twenty fourteen there was another Supreme Court decision in a case called McCutcheon versus federal election commission that allowed a more giving to some of the hard money\nGroups including the parties and campaign in a way that many people rejected would be used as sort of re empower the parties we've seen a little bit of that\nBut certainly big money flowing to these outside groups is still a major factor in our campaign\nSo Kenneth uh in fact I mean to return to Citizens United you mentioned McCain Feingold of course citizen United targeted a ... particular provision McCain Feingold right\n[noise] yeah that's right I mean it was it was a you know the the uh what what the restriction on how these outside groups could spend their money and run by doing away with that it really allowed for these outside groups to become much more powerful and much more useful to political operatives\nKenneth our time is winding down literally and sort of ten seconds we have left the ultimate goal is is valid question as a constitutional amendment do you think there's appetite out there across the country for a serious campaign finance campaign finance or for\nYou know it's always one of those issues that voters will tell pollsters that they care about and sometimes they will even become a major issue in a campaign but I think ultimately when voters go to the ballot box\nIt falls somewhere far below the issues that of a you know the economy and their own pocket books and healthcare and even questions of war and peace\nAnd so it's hard to pass something like this is particularly I think it is easier to do it through the ballot box because you are not facing this impediment that uh the the turtle of trying to get members of Congress to change the system\nAre elected officials at any level to change the system that is clearly work for them because they're in office having navigated that system so that are real fundamental impediment the ballot box or a route is is you know in many ways or it could tap insist sentiment but obviously very

focus on business and the economy\nWill Jeff um let me come back to you this question for you as a proponent of question or two so political donations you mentioned that this is sort of a new phenomenon but political donations have been classified by the courts as a form of speech with more than forty years of of of legal\nPrecedents dating all the way back as we heard from Kenneth at the top of the hour or two this Nineteen Seventy six Buckley versus Vallejo decision so there's a lot of sort of legal\nA foundation I guess in this idea that money is classified political donations are classified by the courts is a form of speech doesn't that mean that limiting spending or restricting these kinds of contributions is going to be a hard pulling the courts and that you are\nOr the argument is that you were blocking are censoring speech\nNo that's not that's actually why we're using a constitutional amendment the court has gotten it wrong for forty years they've gone all over the place a series of five to four decisions Iraq going back to Buckley but remember Buckley came after two hundred years of American history\nMassachusetts first limited campaign contributions in Nineteen oh seven the Tillman act prohibited corporations from spending money in federal elections in Nineteen oh seven unions were not allowed to spend money on elections in Nineteen forty eight only in Nineteen Seventy six\nDid the idea that money is the same as free speech get created and we've had an\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\n... so this amendment actually does the court a favor they've gone back and forth in these five four decisions first saying one thing that I'm saying and other than Citizens United just knocking bulldozing the walls that protected our democracy down so the amendment will actually clear up things\n... your response ah I appreciate that Jeff can recognize that he thinks certain people in power at the Supreme Court may have gotten some decisions wrong\nBut if you were to sit here and actually think comparing a bunch of state lawmakers who have a history of restricting speech for opposing views and opposition will not be much worse than a I have something to share with you that's not the way campaign finance runs in the state\nVery often there's a lot of people that have good intentions but to use it as a weapon to sound speech and unfortunately what we're trying to do is if you vote yes on question to you or empowering people whose only job is self preservation and no offense but there are only job is to win elections\nTo craft your speech as the public into restricted and a time effort time they've actually failed at that I'm pretty badly\nPoll I own a follow up quickly and we're running out of time on this particular segment but I Want to do when they get ... a follow up question on\nWell you mentioned about winning the lottery and spending that money however you want to spend it on a on a political ... isn't there something different and then gets with a lot of people are seeing right now is there something different to wean\nYou as an individual spending that money\nAnd then a made up the corporation for the purposes of a an election spending that money with it donors we just don't even know who's involved there isn't there a difference there the your name you win the lottery you're going to put your pet issue up their versus a nameless corporation with nameless donors\nWell that was kind of a joke that was you know obviously I don't want is a very important distinction I Know but James I mean okay so you're you're trying to make that distinction of you know big corporations\nWho are not individual and invented one for the purpose of an election okay well that's that's very few and far between I think that's kind of highly regulated at this point but for the most part let's just use the example for corporation WB are any other corporate America and promised the group that Jeff works for which is a nonprofit corporation\nOr it's made up of individuals like WB are gifted WB are\nAh there's other for profit corporations the corporation is a pretty broad term so it's very important to know the difference you know ingest case his corporations the nonprofit made up of individuals and corporations who donated his group and in this case he's uses nonprofit to find his bow question\nUm there's nothing wrong with that that's his freedom to use his nonprofit corporation to find a bell question and that's one of the beauties of citizens that is that\nThey're able to give more freedom to entities like that but to your point of other corporations like Exxon or whatever you want to name um they actually do have some rights I'm you know I Can't as an individual go up to Exxon or any big port corporations say hey you know what I Want to list of all your customers on what your financial is they have rights because\nLike the government can't looking like you got your time or we have to ... we have let us in the middle of doing it I Would like to respond to you know\nFirst of all and American promise we have thousands of donors average donation about thirty six bucks are those are people you can go to

state legislative districts in this country are uncontested now since twenty ten in Citizens United\nPoliticians who are elected have massive advantage to raise money from big interest to them they will regulate they get it from unions I get it from big corporations\nAnd they get it by the boat load and so we've got competitive districts no longer competitive we've got incumbents who can't be
