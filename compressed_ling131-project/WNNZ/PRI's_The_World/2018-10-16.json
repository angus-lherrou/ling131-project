you by WB you are the McCormack graduate school at UMass Boston and the Boston Globe and first we're going to introduce this debate about ballot question number three with this report from ... from\nThe law at issue here makes it illegal to deny service to transgender people in hotels stores restaurants or other public places it was overwhelmingly passed by the legislature and signed by governor Baker and has been in effect for a little over two years\nWhen that law went into effect in two thousand six seen it changed my life\nKelly Jenkins says she knows what it is like to be discriminated against because of her gender identity\nBeen refuse service in a restaurant simply for being transgender I've been asked to leave a place that asked is a polite word I've been told to leave a place for using the women's restroom and those things have a lasting impact on me that I still have with me when I moved up here to Massachusetts\nChickens came here from eastern Tennessee back in two thousand and fourteen two years before the transgender public accommodation law was passed she's been working as a teaching assistant at Wellesley middle school for the past three years and she expects to have her own classroom next year the\nWell you know the reason we have such broad support from large and small businesses and from law enforcement officers and and sexual assault prevention experts across the state is because the law actually puts in place much needed clarity\nAround these exact issues the law itself says it cannot be used for an improper purpose gender identity actually has to be consistently and uniformly held which means you can't switch it for\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you add bay path university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications that they pass dot edu\nAnd you know it's it's very clear under this law that if somebody is doing something suspicious they can absolutely be stopped and nobody will be in trouble for doing that but if they're just going about their daily lives minding their own business we have to let them be and I think that that is something that most people in Massachusetts can get behind we all just want to be able to\nYou know move along with our daily lives take\nCare of our families do good job at work bring the groceries home at the end of the day um it'd be left alone if we're not doing anything wrong okay I think Andrew let's let you respond to that\nYou know just briefly so the definition of gender identity of Massachusetts law which is chapter for six and seven paragraphs if the non passes you will where Casey in two thousand eleven which this law rests on\nSays that gender related identity may be shown by providing evidence including but not limited to a that's what they see consist of uniform assertion\nBut can also be shown by any other evidence that the gender religion these sincerely held so it's just not a requirement that it's consistent\nThat as one would have demonstrated but it's not required it boils down to having you sincerely held identity and that's impossible to police\nAnd your response to that Casey what would you say well\nThe law itself is is very clear that there's a different kinds of evidence that people can offer but\nI think the important thing for voters to know if they think about what to do on this question is they are going to hear a number of anecdotes throughout the afternoon that do not involve transgender people that do not involve people asserting this law and saying that they got the protection of this law for the crimes they're engaging in\nThe law does not allow people to do anything illegal they can be stopped and held accountable and they are\nAnd what voters really need to be aware of is at the end of the day this is about people like me\nJust trying to go about our daily lives people like Nicole how that she's a Seventeen year old transgender girl she's like any other teenage girl she wants to shoplift the for ah she wants to be a professional singer someday but she can't be a professional singer in a theater that won't let Iran because she happened to be transgender now for this law is all about\nLike I Want to make sure we get some callers in here a ship on is calling from Newberry port serve on your on the air Hi\nThank you I just didn't know my son is transgender and he's not an animal it's break or any other strange being on any of it like the intention is not to hurt on the any other person on the planet and I do the wording of\nThe law states that its equality for all eating outside of that\nMeaning going into a restaurant a store or anywhere else I don't understand how anyone would like that on any basis that all people should be created equal treated equally\nOn and I think the stair among the ring of what transgender who transgender people are is really obnoxious and nasty they logically never met anyone that is transgender because more transgendered people get killed\nSite straight people than people that are are transgender hurting others\nAnd I just it's just a shame and sharing and that this law should stay out of it not include into the future and that's basically all ...\nStates okay thanks so much on ... Bek was how how would you address your Arabs are two\nPoints first of all I'm this campaign is really not about the transgender issue this is about privacy in safety and bathrooms locker rooms and into places like that\nAnd the reason why we call this law the bathroom bill is because functionally that is the only place where the law has changed since this bills passed in two thousand sixteen the Massachusetts commission against discrimination submitted a letter to the legislature October of two thousand Fifteen making it clear that they have the authority and they have the authority already at that time\nTo a process gender identity discrimination claims in public combinations so if this law would be repealed nobody's rights would be any different when it comes to restaurants movie theaters hospitals places like that the only area that it'd be different would be the bathrooms in the locker rooms and that's where we have the concern\nCasey and what you do have a minute to respond to that before we take some more calls\nI you know I think we can all agree are entering their both lawyers that\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses on farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nThey already and uniformity as a statewide law that's why large and small businesses support this law\nUm and you know changing or people you know what human beings we have to use the restroom sometimes we use a you know we are just as an artist when we're in those places as anybody else um [noise]\nAnd you know at the end of the day but this is really about is a respect and dignity for everybody and safety for all and it's very clear that this law does not impact anybody's safety but it does make sure that transgender people are able to go on our daily lives okay\nWe're going to get to some of the the evidence about safety in a moment but I Want to go to Zach who is calling from ... you're on the air\nAs high rate you for taking my call I I just have a question I'm\nI'm pretty certain with a central implications of you know I'm ... I'm open to changing but I'm concerned about that for by changing biological fact of human socks\nAccording to a changing that on the house of emotions and the Saudis say that um we should because people\nFeel a certain way about humans are traditionally taught that were born with and figure it done scientific outdoor maladies abnormalities ten or ... or ... or ...\nYou get what I'm saying I Do biology has biology is that what you're saying Zak yeah okay\nUh let's let Casey a answer\nThat briefly [noise] you know I think if you never had the opportunity to meet a transgender person it can be a really challenging to understand what it needs to be transgender you know my family is very supportive of me but um they had ... when I first came to them in and explain to them what was going on with me\nYou know I think the most important thing to keep in mind is you know we're all human beings we're all neighbors were family members or friends or co workers\nAnd at the end of the day we don't have to understand everything about each other to be able to treat each other decency and with dignity and respect\nAnd that's that's what yeah some three is all about um that's why there's so much support for it and it doesn't put anybody in risk in the process which is why law enforcement and sexual assault prevention experts resoundingly support yes I'm three\nAnd I'm Wondering just briefly Andrew ... is the point\n[noise] absolutely I mean we have men's rooms and women's rooms because a male bodies in the female bodies are different and that's really all we're trying to maintain a recognition of is that women should not be forced to be in intimate places with Melbourne it's and I think most of them and\nIt doesn't matter to them how the person who has that nobody identifies it as a male intact anatomically male bonding with male genitalia and longer Michelle next to them that make them uncomfortable and what this what the yes on three campaign fails to do is to respect that concern and all\nOf a hat or we're going to have to go to a break right now but I wanted to tell our listeners to stay with us or continuing this debate on ballot question for three and Massachusetts it seeks to repeal the two year old state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity\nA yes vote would keep the current law a no vote would repeal it we've got both sides

she's scheduled a manicure pedicure and when the owner found out that she was a transgender woman she cancelled the appointment\nI think we can all agree that that's wrong that she should have her nails treated like anybody else um\nAnd you know it's about more than ... boss right it's about everywhere we go every day when we're not at home or work it's about restaurants it's about all the

there's another side of the coin here I've worked with a transgender woman she was a brilliant professional I enjoyed working with her I and everyone around me regard email because that was your outward appearance if I walked into the men's room and they'll call her married she was in there my first reaction would be married what the hell are you doing here\nI think I Would be pretty darn uncomfortable and then she would be too so\nUh does this make any sense to have people who you know how we really looked like you know female to be in the men's or it's just makes no sense\nSo I'm going to ask Casey to respond to both of the things we've got a ... and ... safety issues here from a a woman who says that she's concerned about her daughter and what might happen here and also a a folks who may feel uncomfortable what do you do with those uncomfortable feelings Casey how do you address people who are just uncomfortable\nYeah you know I I understand if you've never met a transgender person and you're not familiar with people like us um it can be uncomfortable\nTo sort of figure out what it means and I've I've had people in my life as I have a canal to them and have a lot of questions and and take their time are becoming more comfortable but you know Courtney I'm\nWhen I think about this issue I think about or something like e and you know he's a teenager was transgender um his parents worry that she will face discrimination just going out with friends going to a movie theater\nUm she has a sister and his parents support I guess old on three and they support these protections and I certainly wouldn't support the protection for eating at the expense of his sister um you don't have to take my word for it or that this law works and that and everybody is kept safe including transgender people but not just transgender people\nYou know you can look to the law enforcement supporters you can look to the sexual assault prevention supporters um who all
