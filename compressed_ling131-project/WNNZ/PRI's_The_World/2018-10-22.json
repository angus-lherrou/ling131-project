power all energy solar daughter\nPicked up on this idea we've had fourteen years to watch California's outcomes um we've had fourteen years to study what it means to have ratios and an absolutely every single case Massachusetts out performs um California\nThe reality is there are a lot of studies that look at um the relationship between their staffing and patient outcomes and and every single case the researchers warned against fixed ratios they have unintended consequences\nOkay we should say we're going to get to California a little bit later in the show right now I just want to sort of outline for folks who may not be familiar with all of this exactly what the question is and why you think we need it in and essentially ... say we need it because it will make people a\nSafer and you've tried other ways to get this kind of thing accomplished to ensure patient safety and ensure that nurses are and overwhelmed Nancy says that this needs a lot more work in California the only other state in the country that does have these sort of mandated limits has not proven to improve\nPatient outcomes let's get into the specifics of this law and what exactly would mandate\nFor the typical medical or surgical patients the law sets the limit for patients to a nurse in emergency rooms the limit would be a max of five patients to er nurse the limit for psychiatric units would also be five patients to a nurse so John how are the limits that into the question and why\nSo the the limits were actually using the professional standards of the organizations um one that you didn't mention was actually a a one standards which govern the staffing guidelines for labor and delivery and maternity care\nAnd that's exactly where we got those limits from we looked at all of the research that showed a including Dr Linda Akin's study who when she studied the medical surgical patients the reason that it is one of four\nAh with the flexibility what the acuity tool to actually fair medical surgical nurse to take less patience\nIs because when you go above that limit when a medical surgical\nPatients of five is assigned to a registered nurse that's when you get to see the beginning of the medical medical problems seven percent of an increase of medication errors medical complications happened with the fifth patient and every subsequent patients after that\nCompounds the increased risk to that patients so we've done our homework on this and looking at in California what they did we look to the most recent research and actually modified hours to be more consistent with the fact that patients are sick or in the hospital now than they've ever been\nNancy or any of these numbers written into the ballot question or any of those numbers\nPalatable to your side so I Would say that the biggest issue with a valid question is the rigidity of these numbers um they're the research that Donald was quoting is all based on average is in every single case people do not look at the ratio of nurse to patients and the reason is because\nThat ratio when it is that fixed and when it is that rigid has\nHas limitations for that and there's to be able to use her professional judgment to be able to work with the physicians to decide to take another patient and her assignments and\nI think when we look across the board at the emergency department for example your example of one to five the emergency department requirements in the law are one to one first for the most critical patients one to two if the patient needs care between Fifteen minutes and an hour one to three from one to two it's\nIt's it's so rigid and it would mean an emergency department that a nurse even if she was ready to take another patient from the waiting area she wouldn't be able to do it because this this law would keep her from using her judgment so I'd like to\nFollow up on something Nancy just said you you mentioned averages about ... the question is written for at all times so why was it written that way why not use an average why why do you need the same number of nurses that night as you do during the day\nSo I I think that's a great question but having been a nightmare so my entire career I can tell you that night time is a critical time for patients because even though we would like patients to be able to get adequate rest at nighttime that's even more critical time for nurses to be able to assess\nThe patient stability and that clinical status at that time because what when you have to do that while they're sleeping to make sure\nStreaming of New England public radio was ... all energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money or the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nIs the safest and I don't think there's any secret that patients are in the hospital and out of the hospital as quickly as they possibly can be so patients that would have had that extra day perhaps to be assessed in a different way\nIs already home so we have a very short period of time to do all the work that's required to insurance successful recovery when\nWe hear about you know almost a billion dollars a year I'm just wondering uh Nancy your response first in Guyana of you know would that would that not be passed on to to consumers patients terrier insurers so now the first\nI mean I don't I think we've all um thought about this a lot there's no question that um that a billion dollars is a great deal of money to add to Massachusetts health care we already have twenty five percent of the hospitals that are in the red it would cause another twenty five percent so a full half of the hospitals\nIn Massachusetts would um would be running in the red it's not sustainable the community hospitals are very nervous about what this would mean for their for their ability to stay open to do the programs that they want to do\nA billion dollars would definitely be passed on to consumers and again what are we trying to solve for we have excellent hospitals in Massachusetts some of the best in the country excellent outcome and um I think there's there's no question that billion dollars is um is money that is not well then I'd love to respond\nTo the I mean see as you know hospitals enough corporations and they this is a twenty eight billion dollar industry right now hospitals make choices about where they're going to put their resources\nAnd our position is those resources need to first began with a patient to be sure that the patient has all of the necessary\nResources available to them the safest nursing care possible when they're in the hospital\nThat is what the ballot question is all about is to ensure that the the health care dollars that are intended for patients are spent on patients\nNot spent on corporate buying of other facilities outside of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts outside outside of the the country for that matter we have corporations that are buying up facilities in Malta and China and opening up their way of saying the health care dollars to Massachusetts should remain at the bedside of the hospital patients in Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure we get some of our callers and at least before we go to a break Ben is calling from Arlington Ben you're on the air\nBut it's the journalists and the other side of the slaves was looted [noise] okay\nBen thanks very much for your call Nancy what what are your thoughts about that I mean could this valid question extends to two other professions\n[noise] you know I have to be honest I've been focusing on um what what exactly it means to put a question like this in front of the voters I think it is a big responsibility to write a valid question and you have to consider all the different pieces of it I'm\n... ballot question the way it's written um has so many unintended consequences we are literally trying to imagine how we would hold onto the fragile gains we've made in substance use disorder and mental health\nThe dollars that would be shifted to um to me these ratios worry me on so many fronts um I don't know if it would lend itself to I guess a broader um\nYou know a broader implementation in other professions but I think it would worry me just as much um there is no there is no answer where rigid ratios are ever the right way for professionals to make decisions\nI mean okay we're gonna have to figure out a time Donna I'm going to give you just a couple of seconds ...\nFor the safety of the patient if the research showed that other um areas also needed to have limits put in place absolutely there should be and just as in Massachusetts where looking at safe patient limits for patients were not alone in Massachusetts are surrounding states are also looking to do this other countries that doing this right now\nAnd everyone in the nursing profession is looking at what is the safest way to care for patients\nStreaming of New England public radio is one that

Deb\nIs hospitals are putting a ban is and have no signs everywhere and the intimidation of nurses and patients that are in hospitals right now it's beyond anything that I have ever seen in my whole career as a nurse\nAnd it's it's actually horrifying and shameful the way patients of being frightened and ... with the antics that are going on with the commercials and the whole the wall nonsense and everything else that we've seen\nI think that you can see ought to be ashamed of herself being up here and being the voice of the opposition to safe patient care\nLet's say I'm going to let you respond to that yeah I mean I think I'm calling this as hospitals administrators against nurses is patently untrue um you pointed out that the view our globe um\nPoll showed that nurses are split um nurses that I talk to every day the more they understand the unintended consequences the more they are voting no um but I Will also tell you that every professional nursing organization in

executives that voted on that\nAnd they had to put a disclaimer out about the fact that their membership did not agree with the vote of the members of the executive board so when we talk about who's supporting this question Nancy\nThere are over ... million people that are supporting this all you have to do is look at the almost three hundred and ... that we have received\nFrom people that have concerns and that have heard us over and over and over again saying there is a problem in hospitals with the erosion of nursing care that's being provided to patients and we need to have a safe limit in place that is why we need people to vote yes on question\nOne okay I Know the two of you can go back and forth until the rest of the show here but I Want to make sure we get it and some guy just a quick question from our audience here Jane has posed a question on Facebook and wants to know how this question might affect the poorest patience and Massachusetts and Nancy the I think\nThat you might be able to answer the question what would you say to Jane who's asking this on Facebook\nI mean I I really appreciate the question and I think one of the reasons that Boston medical center has been so outspoken about are concerned about question one is because we take care of the most vulnerable patients in Massachusetts and um we we know that those patients will be um at the most risk\nTheir um the fragile gains we've made 'em in substance use disorder and mental health care in Massachusetts aren't risk with this with a valid question\nI'm Paul had us and John Macdonald from

three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston and ask questions of the folks we haven't studio\nLet's talk about California which is the only state to have as similar nurse staffing law but there's a major differences between California's law and the one proposed for Massachusetts one that's often cited as the implementation timeline California's law five your faith and\nWhereas this ballot question is so much quicker it would go into effect January first John it why is there such a quick implementation on this first of all the seriousness\nOf what's going on in hospitals actually make this a very serious issue but going back to the implementation date as anyone knows that when you do about question you have to have an an actual dates of the law is in effect however\nIt's really up to the health policy commission how fast all of the implementation is done\nAnd following that implementation\nUm and the standards that are approved by the department of public health including the acuity tool\nThat was referenced at the beginning part of the show all of those things has to have to be in place there's no automatic fine set up on January first in the sky is not going to fall\nOn January first about what will happen is is that plants will have to be brought forth to the department of public health for approval they'll have to go through the health policy commission\nAnd then they'll have to be enforcement regulation which that will be up to the attorney general so there are a number of things that have to be in place and having done the ICU law\nI can tell you that it will take some time\nNancy your response I'm not a lawyer but the um the ballot question is very sick a specific around this it says that the Massachusetts health policy commission may not delay um or modified the requirements set forth and it does say that it starts January first\nSo when do you think it might go into effect how long would it take so it really\nIs dependent on the health policy commission but they do have the experience of the intensive care unit law that we worked with\nAnd hospitals like Mass General that you've heard at the beginning of the show already have and acuity tool that's in place um and may be used as a resource and again um I Know that we are going to be talking about California and how that worked in California\nUm but we've had we've been talking about this for Twenty years this is not a surprise to hospitals that this has been identified as an issue um and it wouldn't it should not take any hospital that long to get to where they need to be\nIf California is the example that you say Donna\nI'm wire the limits propose from Massachusetts so different they're much stricter for example for the typical medical or surgical patient the ratio in California is five patients to a nurse but in Massachusetts You're proposing for patients to a nurse and also the penalties in Massachusetts would be more strict so\nPoints there first of all having been a nurse for as long as I have I can tell you that a lot has changed at the bedside of patients over the last Twenty years patients are sicker than they've ever been\nAnd that was the need for changing and really looking at real time research about what is going on in the hospital facilities so that is why we had that important\nUpdate to the uh the numbers in the ballot question they're

mysteriously and brutally murdered ... thank you very much for telling us about\nMotivator no problem thank cheap\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... by the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than than it would be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we'd like you to crunch the numbers for as you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that\nClip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some they had made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not\nSix hundred thousand or even a million which he said or the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nOr things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much I'm certainly not a reason to fire murderous regime that's not only kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was some thing here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages\nSo not all of us have gone through but Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions of dollars some of that money is already swelled and they've started delivering the fifteenth so the money\nIs water under the bridge since that's already been spent we're not going to see it again that would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need new system so what's actually on the table that light changes the deal for a missile defense system called fab\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and they've yet to agree on the details so in theory the Saudis can say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nCommunications maintenance and spare parts they would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much of that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy and not all that his weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say\nSo it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up I think\nThese reports said the communities were in quote imminent danger and ... was one of the places\nOn the top of the list now at this point you might be asking yourself why ... in such a precarious spot to begin with\nI heard something to the effect of these dumb Eskimos why did they why did they build their community on a barrier aren't and when\nThis is Kelly ending walk\nTo factor matters because the church and the bureau of Indian affairs\n... belt any mock heads the ... circuit polar council and Alaska based in Anchorage but she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along the part of the coast and they use the island frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools\nIt was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taking away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island\nSo this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions but the sticking point was money\nWe had so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms

R. dot net\n... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some grant money and some grant programs bone up but uh boy it's just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars it within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change Clinton was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because you you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory or it's fact and of course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a whiff of climate change to it has to stop\nThen a few months later Clinton got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should a state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there\nAre in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great\n[noise]\nI reach out twice to the department of the interior for comment but they did not respond\n\nSo given how tenuous the situation is [noise] why don't people just leave ... ref like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else known are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them to just assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think is is\nHorrible sauce everyone I met in ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together\nPeople here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essentials of life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends on keeping those relationships intact blow to restructure Dick
