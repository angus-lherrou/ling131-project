variety of issues I mean one of the biggest issues when you're talking specifically about the northern triangle country and the alliance for prosperity\nThis is a program that arose out as a separate migration crisis that we had in two thousand fourteen when a lot of company in child migrants arrived at our southern border President Obama at\nTime and knowledge that in order to really address migration you need to go to the root causes and and look at what's going on in these countries to cause people to tip fleeing and really have this mass exodus\nThe alliance for prosperity is designed to increase economic prosperity and other countries and strengthen institutions they consider it a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the budget line for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador Ken the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress just slash an aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to ... to end it to these countries he really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nAnd Sarah how political do see this move being is it something that Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when Hindi election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms so this caravan effectively as a political gas to him than Republicans\nIn that they can play this out they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country to quote unquote friends this care of and\nA Trump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala of about what could happen if

to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognize that we had a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think well it will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of real concern on the ground around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reference to the asylum system including changing a silent for individuals who are applying at our border like this caravan so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the cave and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration quite backlog which stretches on for years so waiting in the United states and the way down the line\nWe're using an age I'm a birth date to push kids out of what is obviously the best education\nEnvironment for them for their success there's no other reason you would not want a student who
