cemeteries\nCommunities are scrambling to adapt to the ground literally shift the nice ... but ... says permafrost is important to all of us no matter where we live because it's providing a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age so like eleven thousand years or so ago and that material in the ... is that old like it is made\nOut of material from plants that use to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead animals are in the soil to not fossilized Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material has a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plants in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the pill like out of the freezer and let's start she saw\nAnd so then one from a frost it starts to truly saw than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because migrants by eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon so it's a micro breath that we have to worry about [laughter] basically [laughter]\nMicrobes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn up a basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere as methane or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them stalling speeds them backup\n\nBack at the lake Matilda rose up close to a big funnel floating upside down in the water that has a big syringe fitted onto the skinny and sticking out these little contraptions look pretty homemade because they are\nThe the way we make them float disposable using poodles things from using swimming pool [laughter]\n[noise] so you take your funnel turn it upside down\nRather piece of pool noodles around the wide part and put a plastic syringe on the top and you've got yourself a little trap designed to capture gases bubbling up from the lake below Matilda wrote us up to another child and your team reaches over the side of the boat with a syringe\nAnd his hand so he's pulling out the gas\nSome middle leaders of gosh they're just used to be ... intellect sediments\nA word from the ... and the global federal shrewd water into our trip and those were the servants they likely captured a mixture of gases most of which are well look you're not saying that we're not sure so we used to love among the measure the actual physical description\nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas and these scientists have forty or these bubble traps on this lake and a bunch more nearby\nThey check all of them multiple times a week all summer long and this is all just to understand how much methane is coming off this one small area this year under these particular conditions\nGroups of scientists are at work around the Arctic studying sites that are wetter or dryer colder or warmers with more or less vegetation and they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nThink the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amounts\nWe're so much for the last year we're doing it again New England public radio second and you'll just be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north happen you're glad rags owners get your tickets today at NPR a duck minutes\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never warm the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective we're in what climate scientists call a new analog situation a massive global experiment\nHere is not that we turn on the big Arctic permafrost machine that we don't know what it does [noise] um and until we actually figure out what it does maybe you could do to stop turning up [noise]\nIf you have a warming of one degree that makes all the difference in the world because it gets from frozen to thought and that is something that scientists are really worried about because then many ah thresholds that he might cross their\n... says that in many parts of the Arctic permafrost has already thought enough to start emitting carbon in other places the frozen soil is right on the cusp of that pay the point where a change of one or two degrees can transform it from being something that stores carbon to something that ...\nWe might tip the scales of these really large exchanges then it can have really ...\nIt's not about saving the polar bear I think a lot of people and I think I mentioned that slowed as if you had to pull up back in ... but but it's also about like us dividing as a species because if it gets much warmer act the way that we have evolved with our agriculture and how we like the food that we eat\nAnd where we live is just not adapted to and\nWe don't know how close we are to a massive release of carbon from frozen Arctic soils but we do know that every bit of carbon we emit into the atmosphere gets us closer to that point\nScientists call it a positive feedback loop more carbon in the air leads to more warming which leads to the release of more carbon in the process just builds on itself\nAnother thing we know is that we don't get a second chance at this once our emissions potentially trigger this huge release of carbon we put ourselves at the mercy of processes that we can't control and that will dramatically reshape the earth's climate and our own civilizations\nI ask your team if he thought there was any way to stop this experiment we're conducting on the Arctic or if he thought the damage was already done and now we just have to ride it out [noise]\nNow we have an ability to stop of course we do we have choices and I think especially in the western world in which will we have choices and therefore we have responsibility [noise] um [noise]\nUm [noise] one of the ways is to try and understand this experiment better and that's my ... that's what we do here and the other part is acting on what we
