motion as kind of a surveillance camera posted high above the U.S and keeping observance but sympathetic watch I'm not just Pakistan in Palo Alto but London Sidney Madden cash Tokyo\nAnd that's a lot about views about vistas in his new novel that really I don't think there's a single contemporary writer who gives us the aerial view as medicine does so it's really an honor for me to welcome us an homage to the city or some like just stage\n[noise]\nWelcome thank thank thank you for coming here now so you just had any drone on about this new form you've created and I've always wanted to use it seems like with each new book you create a new form you spend a lot of time thinking about the shape of the book before you need and again I think\nI Do um uh but but very often the form I think that a book will take us not to form that winds up picking and um [noise]\nUh it seems to me that each story has inappropriate for um that that you need to find a way in which a story can do what it is meant to do\nAnd uh and you know when I began writing or with my first ... smoke uh I thought you know I was trying to respond to very judgmental society that was Pakistan\nAnd uh and so this idea of a trial whether we have to judge with the characters were up to and the characters are behaving in ways that they weren't supposed to or felt very natural but then each book has sort of had its own\nProject in a form that was associated with them\nAnd do you determine totally not to repeat yourself against I've done this once I Move on it's\nThat I think um it's partly a I've done it once and I moved on but it's partly that I Do think that there is a form appropriate to each one so in in the case was often fundamentalists yes I definitely wanted to move away from the multiple narrator a way of telling a novel that ... was\nBut also I thought that that mobile because it was about the way in which we um are in a a highly frightened or anxiety induced age are constantly a nervous about each other\nUm that it would make that none of us in the central to itself and and that it would tell half of a very tense story\nAnd to read it would be placed in a position of hearing this Pakistani character talk to an American presumably American stranger or I never hear the Americans responses\nAnd or an addition to fundamentally unsettling physician and and so what are you going to make of this how will you the reader stabilize this do you believe the Pakistani what do you think is going on\nAnd in the process of stabilizing you the reader asked to um take insufficient information and create a narrative\nAnd as you do that as you filmed the novel and your imagination in your mind um you or reveal yourself to yourself and and so it seemed to me that that was a way\nTo look at the um the suspicion um that we are living in\nA by reflecting back at the reader or movements putting the radio on trial yeah well on trial ... yes I mean are on trial and maybe it is stronger than I Will do\nI Would yeah but in ... absolutely I mean it I suppose less that it just putting the reader on trial and more that it is potentially enabling the reader to be aware of themselves in the process of reading um so it's less a judgment and more of a mirror\nUm and and that hopefully that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield ... falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd I'm In this time when we were told to be so suspicious\nAnd face up to the feelings that we'd pretend to hassle yeah yeah and also\nAnd also the ease with which I'm we can have an ... an artist constructed for us so I often tell people that you know a a multiple of Britain about nothing fundamentalists and called it a thriller and when I'm told this I say yes it's a thriller in which nothing really happened [noise]\nRight and um and the reason why it's a thriller is because we were all really thrilled before we began the book um we live in a world that we imagined to be at through them and so somebody gives a certain personality\nIf somebody gives us a few sketched images I'm a certain way of speaking um we conjure fourth yeah uh the thriller from within us and uh and to me that's important because I'm\nA ... you know it may be that we\nLive in the world that is much less unsafe that we imagine I'm a ended our eagerness to imagine it's an safety is in fact the biggest danger that we that we face ...\nInstead of the political situation has given us position in which you an eye on the possessing types and they strike fear in the hearts of\nFaith I mean we looked like potential say yes I mean I I I'm reminded of that you know from time to time when I Walk through a security a checkpoint in America and I suddenly put on about six inches of hiding\nA hundred pounds of muscle becoming a deeply threatening a first and it must be difficulties screened and occasionally hold off aircraft when they're already on the runway I'm ah in that sense it's quite empowering but um [noise]\nBut uh you know or\nYou should be careful what you wish for us [laughter]\nYeah I used to get ... every time I Would tend to Japan and a happy\nNew dress appropriately I mean this is the thing that you know a certain point you have to think how old are you going to respond to this you know uh what reading material you carry you know what a\nA a you know what kind of um [noise] uh what will you reveal yes um and this I think is actually a very important because now we live in the world where\nI've been recently we've been told that a a agents will have the right to inspect your computer or your mobile phone I'm at the border\nAnd these are such a deeply private things right to you have your your children's photographs you have your love letters you have um pictures of people who passed away you're in the most personal life in these places and we're saying that somebody who\nBut the we're all equally weird\nAnd uh and that and at this\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu or just like bottle does\nDo you think that the distances and differences between patients getting great because at the illusion of knowledge forty years ago somebody had couldn't imagine she knew everything about Pakistan now damages on our screens we know that\nWell I think what's happening is since you mentioned screens and how we know things um I think what's happening is that the screen based a system of information that we're not engaging with a is profoundly different from what's come before\nSo what has happened to us is in this technological cultural moment um\nWe have seen simultaneously um the the transformation of of news er into entertainment or into a profit seeking entertainment business now a profit seeking entertainment business seeks to maximize attention\nUm the goal of this is to have as many viewers or or or readers or people who liked or retweeted um the piece of information now how do you get that\nUm the way that human beings are designed is we are designed to privilege and prioritize and give a greater importance to threatening information\nUm so are you know if there's a flash of orange behind the trees or we could say well it's probably on the tiger but we're we are designed to say that that might be a tiger because our ancestors who said it probably wasn't a tiger have all been eaten by tigers and [noise]\nAnd the genes have not been passed on to us than those of us who are left um for the for the basis you know ... to stay alive\nWe we privilege frightening information in the same way that if you walk down the street your street every day or for a year and a thousand people say hello but the courses that you you will forget every single one of those those but one person who shouts racist epithet a Jew you might remember for your entire life\nBecause that was a hostile frightening potentially threatening thing we privileges that information\nSo then you have a profit making sort of enterprise um that wants to our attention what do we give our attention to we give our attention to threats and\nSo what begins to occur is that we are presented with threats now um it's not that we just open the newspaper and accounted offensive we turn the television but not because of our phones we are receiving disinformation about threats on a new continuous basis\nThat is fundamentally destabilizing I think to the human organism it has created in this moment the sense that we are so menacing to each other\nUm that uh uh there's no way forward it has a crippling I'm a excess uh addiction um ah to threat perception\nUm which causes us to recoil from the future because the future is full of threats and would that enables a this recording from the future and pessimism would that enables is a kind of nostalgic politics\nAnd ... politics is spreading all over the world and this politics tells us don't look forward to back let's make Islam great again you know let's make you know Britain great again and you know I Believe in America there might be something like that also have um [noise]\nAnd so um and so we are presented with just the style Jake let's go back I mean we cannot do because time does not work in that way um that's the pernicious environment in which you find ourselves and so when you say you know that we know more about each other\nWe may know more about each other but we certainly are experiencing is a very heightened sense that we are threatening to each other and um and I think that is completely misguided but also self fulfilling\nAnd there's also the adoption at the screen and had I been in the car with you and your wife I developed at an even more useless suggestion for title\nWhich is the longing or the poignancy of cell phones ... reading that I thought part of what's going on in your book is that people in Pakistan, India everywhere and seeing images of the promised land and the promise life ... images and then finding than others 'cause you think that you didn't see them that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and small ones from a certified naturally grown fruit farm in Amherst offering berries pairs and pies that their farm stand small ones farm dot com\nThe when the audience of a familiar with it so I'm In the novel these two got to say the ... fleet this city where they live which are descending into terrible violence and the novel obeys the laws of physics as we understand them for the most part with one slight exception which is that in the novel these black doors have begun to open\nAnd and he's black and doors um for example the door to you about from here in San Francisco to your closet one day it becomes an opaque black rectangle and if you push yourself to that you find yourself no longer in uh San Francisco but in\nKyoto or the whole organ shot solve a problem with some other place far away\nAnd then people begin to move through these in the ... billions of people and the next several centuries of migration code within a year or two um so as far as cell phones are concerned you know these black doors if it was it oh this is magical realism or this is some you know science fiction\nUm you know perhaps uh but uh I think that the prevalence of these small black doors that we carry with us these little black rectangles which is the screen of our phones [noise]\nUm [noise] and that except for you because I Know it doesn't have one I think almost everyone in this room I'm Will have one of these rectangles black rectangles either in the in the pocket or in the handbag or in their backpack or a on the person I'm\nAnd these things called out to us you know like uh the ring calls out to a call them\nYou know my precious and uh it is a seminar tension and we sort of have some of your finger on your phone right now is I just see and\nThe um you know you experiencing this lord of the rings like a connection and and uh and the anxiety when we don't have a phone\nWith us but what is the phone make possible the phone is a portal through which our consciousness departs and the geographic location about body that is what the phone is\nWhen my children send me a video of what they've done today um and I look at that video I Am seeing Pakistan and I'm thinking about the whole but equally I could be reading an article about Japan or about India um about a Brazil or about you know efforts to colonize Mars or the\nFictional history of West arose and I will be in these places and so um this is the world with going into and and for me the notion that well if this is what technology is doing is is it is sort of\nObliterate in a um geographical physical barriers um collapsing distance um then isn't not\nA worthwhile imagining what if I bought this could go through ... um isn't that where we're sort of headed and and then that enables or what you're talking about this is\nAn except ... it's not much of anything and so that pull it off to countries that will never admit you yes and as you were saying at the asset well the the [noise] um this is what remains to be seen\nSo the borders are not being created the question is what we do when people come\nUh I think it will not be the case that people will choose not to go now that people can see they will come the question is what do we have on the other side of the\nUm [noise]\nNo [noise] ah I tend to think that human history is over time I'm a journey towards greater equality and so we have seen that I'm In this country a hundred and fifty years ago a African American people\nWere ah legally ah deemed to be slaves um less than a century ago women couldn't vote but now we believe that people have would be called different races or which is itself an interesting concept but let's just use it people of different races are equal\nPeople have different genders are equal or people of different or no religious belief should be treated equally gay people than straight people should be treated equally um it seems to me a utterly unsustainable that we should believe in Jesus\nMore

R. dot net thank you very much\nIn Sao paolo should have fundamentally different entitlements to where they can live and what kind of life that can enjoy the child in Mogadishu in Milwaukee should a fundamental because of the laundry of where they were born\nOne should stay in a place where they could be killed violently and have nothing to eat and the other should be able to live in a place that is safe and whatever because of what you know what is this principle\nUm and I think that in two or three hundred years people will look back at this moment in human history and think that we who prevented a refugees especially then migration\nUm they will think that we are as barbaric\nAs we imagine that slave holders were a hundred and fifty years ago\nAnd so um and so this is my view now\nUm when you say that OK well people can move the cutting because we're stopping them right or you can move a container full of you know T shirts or from Asia to America for almost nothing you could move people for almost nothing too if you want to do um\nWe're stopping them but what we are discovering is that\nThe reason why all of these equality is built on each of the racial equality gender equality sexual orientation religious beliefs et cetera all built on each other is because it is impossible to deny equality and sustain the other qualities it's hard to deny one [noise]\nI'm In ... in a way is a rebuttal to myself because when I moved back to Pakistan ... in my family you know where's the kind of a conservative black robot not deal with\nAnd I had certain uh imagine you know pre suppositions about what it meant to dress in this seemingly conservative way why does a woman do this what kind of person is is um [noise] and it took some years of encountering women like this to for me to realize you know just what a a kind of\nMischaracterization I was engaged and so you know when once my my wife's friend came over to our house and the swimming is walking up the driveway dressed in black face was covered I was just walking straight towards me and I was thinking you know who is this person\nShe flips off the hood and it's this friend and my wife who's at db actress and so I said oh you know coming from a set she goes no no I'm just that you know I Can't go grocery shopping anymore without being mobbed by people so now I put this thing on and I'm totally anonymous\n[noise] um [noise] and ah and on the one hand\nIt speaks to you know something quite but not all that ... you know so that this is the stars version of the who the in the sun glasses\nOn the other hand it does speak to 'em something about the gays um and how the gates and others does diminish our freedom in a sense um and how this was this one woman's reaction to particular context to that situation\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and valleys solar a local photovoltaic design at the installation company serving people and planet to live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nComputer coding with [noise] and um and she came to the house and er\nEr and she was a a cousin of mine a woman who runs and a AI a tech company I'm sort of interviewed the student and said oh she's the woman she's the one I think should teach your daughter but I assume seated on the phone because women came and her face was covered her head was covered and I thought it was a bit surprised\nUm Saddam and my daughter's influences in for her first computer code in class and my daughter's wearing pink two two and a sort of tank top and sits down next to this teacher um\nAnd it turns out that my daughter adores this teacher the teacher is incredible the fantastic\nAnd as I get to know this woman it turns out that this woman is you know a PHD student that you'd tutors on the side she supports not just herself but her sister's for elderly parents I'm just putting ourselves through this you know this doctorate and I mean she was just completely heroic a trailblazing you know female figure and\nAnd so in many ways not idea was something that I had to learn and um that ah when the woman with something out of our own choice\nIt means what she intends to me\nAnd whatever we those who are outside imagined it to me that's just what we imagine and so and so what does it mean for an audience mobile it's a bit ambiguous and um but I met enough people now to recognize that ah it can sort of mean really anything yeah\nAnd he began and you ended that onset by talking about ambiguity and previously really with the reluctant fundamentalist you're talking about I'm suddenly that sense which essentially have to do with protection and preconception and all the things we voiced on what we don't understand whether it's the I Will will romance\nAnd there's so many scenes in the book of tough guy says had the book with you know moving into the age of uncertainty and when I put it down I thought this is a really melancholy book\nAs I've heard you talk about the future and what you were just saying that two hundred yes and that this will seeming that balance moments 'cause the world is moving in a positive direction I hear you speak for a lot of sense\nHow do you see the future you are you divide is\nI think that the future contains both\nUm and it contains both in this this is the sort of the duality of the future that the the future is um it is both\nFor each of us as individuals we will be extinguished we will cease to exist um the future contains tragedy at the level of the individual but yet it also contains rebirth and hope and optimism and beauty\nAnd its balancing those two things ride um how do we um uh an end in a sense one of the great failings and I think you know contemporary culture is all over the place\nIs I'm so much of our culture had been addressed to this question of you know the fact that the self tends to be a human being is to lose everything\nWe lose our childhood we lose our friends we lose our parents which is a lover we lose life\nAnd yet it is possible despite this predicament to live a life that has so much beauty and so much connection and so much affection so much hope tenderness how do we do that\nNow [noise] um what I think as occurred is that we have seen a ... victory you could say in cultural terms of of a kind of capitalist impulse\nWhich tells us that that self interest is the fundamental motivation of humanity and should be celebrated and should be elevated to the prime a position\nNow self interest is very useful it creates well if it is it is a productive thing it certainly is part of what can you know motivate us successful society\nBut if we ... our value system entirely on self interest we are incredibly exposed to the predicament that the self and\nI'm a society built entirely on self interest is a size ... unbelievably terrified of the ending of the self um and uh and and vulnerable\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded

about group political dynamics as opposed to the individual or shared human a spiritual predicament\nUm what kind of in this limbo and so what what occurs is a profound sense of depression you know that that humanity right now I think is engaged in a\nIn a kind of deep state of psychological depression and we see the manifestations of this everywhere so when a young child and Pakistan goes into a shopping mall with bombs strapped to their body and blow themselves up um and kills\nTwenty or thirty strangers and imagines that this could conceivably be considered a good death\nAnd when a young child in America goes into a school and she was dead thirty of them for years and then kill themselves and imagine that this could be a good death\nUm we have as a society utterly failed in addressing the question of what does cause you to death we used to have ideas about this but now it seems to be that we are so unwilling to engage I'm In this topic that we are you know a more\n[noise] and so I think it's worth a looking across you know all of our\nCollective wisdom as human beings all the stuff that we have known to figure out you know what do we do about this and and the truth is it there are things um that out of the melancholy of dusk there has always been a there always been antidote\nI'm so for example you know you could imagine a kind of I'm a Buddhist or humans and approach which would say that\nIf one of routes once presence in the in this moment fully or end is aware and present in this moment the past begins to recede the future is revealed as a kind of illusion um and the moment expands to such a degree that are ... of the future moment diminishes\nOr you could say that if you look at for example the ah the suit the tradition of of a comic mysticism love base mysticism\nOr the equivalent of Jewish a tradition of somebody like Martin ... and his eyes out a love based relational mysticism or similar positions in so many other places but those things tell us is\nIf we love in the right way and strongly enough we transcend a self\nAnd the fact that the self and it's less\nTerrible um and what does this mean right this is all sort of highfalutin stopped but like I I've come to understand as I moved to Pakistan or my father for example has lost his brother recently lost his best friend recently\nUm and yet he speaks of the future and he says oh you know well are we going to get this bike paths sorted out so that would be ... bicycle or you know we have to build this tree house because the kids are getting old enough to he's excited about these things in the future why\nBecause his love for his grandchildren has altered his ... his relationship to time\nTheir future is something that excites them and each of us has the potential to have a kind of love which is not a possessive love and\nYou know not the love of a I Love you so you are my wife or I own you but ah the non possessive form of love which is not I love you because you make me less lonely but I Love you which means I Want you to be less lonely\nBecause we can experience this that too is an editor and there's so many others and so I think for me what's interesting is now to engage in a human conversation when we say look let's take this stuff that you take it out of its specific religious non religious ethnic whatever traditions\nLet's find a book hardly that everybody can participate in and let's begin to speak of it because not speaking of it has led us into horrific state of of of crisis Mm [noise]\n\nThen the age of global conversation I've always found it a
