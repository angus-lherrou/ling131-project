I I wrote it I'm\nReally having a notion or a clear idea that I was going to publish it or that I Would have the\nGuts to publish it um I've ruined it for myself because I needed to find out something that I didn't know and um\nI I I think I had been ... with it you know it evolved thing with that\nFor for a long time because I was always picking writing classes and you know us UCLA Extension or

did and back in Nineteen Seventy six and you say in the ... more of that that was the first time you had a glimpse of what it meant to be inside a character\nAnd you see there's actually a lime and

it um they had called him and if I didn't do it might never work again ...\nAnd I went oh\nReally and I got scared so\nIt was the beginning of of learning that every time I made a decision because I was scared\nIt it wasn't the right one um\n[noise] and I felt defeated from day one I uh I\n...

myself that I could never blame the them the them the industry the the the unfairness of it all the the the something it it could never be that if I wasn't worried want it to be it had to be because I wasn't good enough\nAnd that's when I got good enough that would just change and\nStreaming of New England public radio was on wor other western ... offering personal and professional gross through

actor asked you to be in a scene with them even though it was something you did not want to do in a million ... million years you just did it anyway and did your best because you were supposed to participate with your fellow students\nAnd I had done that with them and not just to to ask me to to play in a in a two character play called the horn the player I think it is and of course I was not the horror [laughter] I was it was supposed to be like a two sides of the same person\nUm and one of them was like the Marilyn Monroe ish character and one of them was the none issue carrots [noise] which one she wanted me to fight [noise] and so automatically I didn't want to do it but I ... you know I was you know going to do the best they could and but it was but I wasn't\nReally taking it seriously\nAnd and by then it was kind of cocky I was kind of shirt myself with lead well you know\nJust going to do a little fancy footwork\nChair and a little you know a fair and I'll be just\nYou

because\nThey're the patterns that in childhood sort of a survival mechanism but as an adult they get on my way they've gotten my way and they no longer serve me and I can't I Can't untangle them um there's a saying that\nWhat's what's fired together is wired together and I'm a\nTherapist a psychological saying that that as a child when several emotions strong emotions are happening at the same time\nI'm like for instance with my stepfather and needed his love and affection he was magically was bigger than life and my real father ignored me and she my stepfather\nJust didn't turn in was

the line\nWhile the other big figure a course in this in this triangulation is your mother who and what she knew or didn't know during during the course of the Senate and it's very moving the way you write at the end about\nYou're coming to some accommodation was about that not necessarily a complete its model sweetness and light what happens between your mother but you you you love your mother\nDeeply um and in the complex way that the mothers and daughters sometimes is particularly when there's abuse happening I'm the mother knew something but didn't know at all it's it's really quite\nUm it's quite extraordinary and I just I Wonder if if as you were writing it did you know all of these things before you could I mean did you discover knows and the writing but I discovered\nIn the writing I discovered so much in the writing and it was hard to do is hard to get it was hard to move away from it it became you know addicted to it\nI'm ... and I\n... you know I Would have it in my pockets in my shoes they had\nBecause I didn't want to be away from it and I'd be drawn a way to go to work and do other things which is probably a good idea\nAnd I come back and it would be sort of fresh but I I\nThe big ingredients the big things I was looking for I didn't discover until I made myself go back and look at it I made myself read my journals that I hadn't written something\nI had written a very key thing in my journal um you know only like Fifteen Years prior to this and I wrote it down it happened I wrote it down and completely\nWiped it from my brain and yet something in the newly needed to write it down and it was only in doing this that I went\nWait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait one minute and went and found a journal and went and got went\nOh my God and could peace some things together\nThat we're in pieces um\nAnd I understand um\nAnd I think ultimately what I was looking for was what I felt about my mother um I did not want to feel um that she had left and ah um\nThat she wouldn't taught me first I needed to haunt me and then I I thought do I am I feeling angry I don't know and then ultimately I'm\nAt the very end when I'd done all of this for seven years and I was sitting with my youngest son Sam I'm who is the only one who I'd let me ... ... ... actually I Would read it to him as I was putting the last chapter trying to figure out what how it fit together\nAnd they said why did I Do all of this what is this about what did I learn just something I look for something and I all the time and I still don't know what it was and he said\nOh my God mom don't see how different you are then you were seven years ago how differently you feel about yourself\nAnd I went oh God\nYes you're right I Do and that really is the end of the book it's the last understanding of it that I write I'm about my mother and um\nI realized that they didn't need her to haunt me uh I'm fine without her and\nSomeday she will come and get me [noise]\nLet me just switch gears all them ask you about some of the people that you've worked with some of your close to what you mentioned Joanne Woodward and ... ...\nTalk a little bit about what the I mean it's such a [noise] the two of you it's just to do ... yeah and that it's just really mark will tell me about working with with her on on the well she um\nStreaming of New England public

you know being famous or looking really pretty or she just one of the work get me to the work\nAnd she boy did she know how to work and she was just dead on and there was no um there was no ego involved it was always about the scene and\nUm I've been lucky enough to work with a few people like that\nUm I think Joanne Joanne really was the first and um\nYou know she just was one of the few people in my life really\nYou know sit here take my hand and I got it\nUh so I she just as a as a gym\nNo you you and Robert leaving her grade in in on race really is a great or it's just a great you know this Jewish classic Jewish guy from New York and and and the character that you play\nThat there's real ... chemistry is is sort of a cliche but there's something more than ... physics going on between the two of you know what what was it like working with with him on that\nHe was you know he's again a wonderful guy and a wonderful actor but I think the chemistry that you see between\nRun and I it's really I'm already written I\nUm and you know played through Ron I'm because ... was came into my life than he was such a huge influence\nIn my life from then on um\n[noise] and so it's it's interesting um that\nHe he's so I'm ... and self around a\nA performance and that and I'm In a production but he's never eat in a different take over it or anything but\nUm I think the the Enron and I really loved working with each other but\nI was seeing Marty when I Lived\nAt Ron I'm not how I adored him\nWith with the the most influential director for you what you say\nI guess you know absolutely and that's even though I've been lucky enough to work with some wonderful directors but he it was the role in and how we and how he um enabled me and he had come from the actors\nStudio and and I'm the same way that you know they he he was close friends with Lee and ... van and all that and he had a language that I understood and I didn't have to decipher his language to into my own I'm acting language and\nHe thought the exactly the same acting language and so it was fun for us to to play chess games with each other and see if we get out maneuver each other you know and um I don't know that I ever really quite\nAgain ... ...\nAh when Lincoln the possibility of Lincoln came up you that determination that you've been talking about really went into high gear you are determined to
