in\nThe sustaining of our democracy or this is a very\nPearl is an important moment so I look forward very very much to the conversation\nThank you I Know there'll be lots of questions from the audience but tell us again why did you find it around and reflect on your lawn that I live by that I think he actually gave part of the answer\nNo no no I yeah I did get part of the answer\nI I did it because I think it's relevant to the moment that we're in a Bob Woodward's book is a terrific summary and extraordinarily well reported as he does and every one of you in here knows that there is no way as publisher ... my publisher to and there is no way that she\nIs going to go to print without the lawyers being confident about sources and what he's done just hundreds of hours of tapes so

about why we went into service my my parents were greatest generation parents my mother\nI'm born in Paris or live the better part of our earlier not the better by all of her early life in Europe because my grandfather was a was a\nBusinessman involved in a business in Europe at the time and live between England and France right up until World War two and a actually way back when he was involved with the surge in any in the founding of the bank of America\nAnd to my regret sold his stock too early [laughter]\nUh so my mother didn't come to America really until she was about twenty four years old\nBut she's American she comes from the Boston family and and she lived there and that introduced me to war at a very young stage I writing a book about how my earliest memories walking with my mother in France Nineteen forty seven I was four years old and holding her hand and she was crying\nAnd I didn't know why she was crying it upset me but\nI could feel that you can hear the glass crunching beneath my feet\nAs we walk through the ruins of what had been the family home and all that I remember it was seeing a chimney go up into the sky and the and the stairwells going up into the sky it was all of us left I remembered visiting the beaches of Normandy four years after the war there was still the ... civil war and those beaches\nYou know blown out tanks and so forth Higgins boats\nAnd it became it it it it just imbued me with a sense of service sense of duty sense of responsibility\nAnd a group of us at Yale uh\nMy good friend Freddie Smith the founder of FedEx

about developed countries doing more and less developed countries which is a killer formula\nI pointed out that this was the single\nMost ... shared responsibility you could have lie because each country decided itself what it was going to do and no country decided to do anything that he couldn't do\nThat is why President Trump outright lied to Americans today pulled out\nBecause he stood up in front of the country and said this agreement pushed to greater burden on the United states\nAnd the answer is no it didn't\nIt only undertook to do what we knew we could do with the support of major fortune five hundred companies ranging from the Google and the apples and so forth all the way to Exxon Mobil\nAnd BP and others all of them said we need to do this so we cannot have parts of what was the significance of powers the significance of Paris is that we\nBasically put our faith in the private sector which I Believe I I've grown more and more private sector oriented over the years because as you watch the world changing as the dynamic changes we're witnessing industrial revolution size changes and culture and society and workplace\nIn trade and in in globalization but it's happening at digital pace is unprecedented\nAnd that's part of the anger that is filled American workers in the American people because they feel increasingly disenfranchised and shocked and shell shocked by it all uh and watch a lot of the voter that Donald Trump appealed to by the way it's also a voter the Bernie Sanders appeal to\nAnd it's out there it's also in the center you don't have to be on the right or left to feel that way government is not working in America folks and we know in some of the reasons why and what we have to do about it but the bottom line with us back to the climate changes we were trying to send a message in Paris to the private sector\nOne hundred and Ninety six countries are all going to move in the same direction at the same time and that creates the largest market the world has ever seen\nThe energy market and why energy because energy is the solution to climate change there's nothing we can do to change the course were on that isn't subject to making better decisions about how we create electricity what we do with our buildings how we burn oil or gas or coal and other things and how we moved to a renewable sustainable\nFuture the market that I knew in Massachusetts I represent Massachusetts twenty eight years we had a terrific tech base not quite Silicon Valley but\nIn the early years very very strong and still strong and we had a one trillion dollar market in the Nineteen nineties with with what the one billion users the energy market is today four to five billion user market in a multi trillion dollar market\nAnd it's going to grow to nine billion users and the next Thirty years is the biggest market the world has ever seen and by Donald Trump pulling out of Paris has pulled us out of the position of leadership and in that market\nSo but here's the rub this is why I said I'm going to be the skunk Paris goal was to keep the rise in the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade\nWe're probably right around one point three one point five already today we're right there but my friends in this century my grandchildren yours I'm going to live to experience\nA four degree rise in temperature for degrees is what we are on track to see now what you see barreling towards the coast the Carolinas today the size of the storm intensity that repetitive with which it formed\nIs a direct consequence of the warming of the water and the increase of the moisture you have therefore in the air and therefore more rain\nHarvey Irma and Maria all deposit it one storm Harvey alone deposit it as much water flows over

state I went to Norfolk, Virginia and the largest navy base in the world and we talked with the military but what they're having to do because\nOf the preparations debate because of climate change and the rise of sea level I went to Antarctica because when I went to the Arctic the scientist there said Mr Secretary you got to go and our our ticket to really understand what's happening in terms of the changes so I went to Antarctica\nAnd lo and behold yeah I heard from scientists room Seventeen different countries about the ... with which the west Antarctic ice sheet which is three and a half miles deep ice is melting and and shows a Fisher\nLarson ice sheet broke off larger than the size of the state of Rhode Island and floated out to sea and they're afraid that the whole thing may melt

northwest passage in the summertime\nAnd people trying to exploited I mean it's changed last year for the first time in history\nWe recorded above freezing temperatures in the Arctic in February so you know I get angry when I when I think about this\nDonald Trump's decision to pull out of that agreement is going to cost lives it just is as good a cost billions of dollars of damage to property and you're going to witness some of it and the next ... hours next days but that's just the beginning\nWe've had an average of seven hurricanes years since Nineteen Seventy two in the Atlantic which is more than normal and now they're two other hurricanes behind Florence that are sort of building out there so my friends what do you do about it what is the solution but I'd be doing well I'll tell you what the ... United States\nAnd if I were president today I Would have an emergency meeting of the G twenty I take the richest countries in the world and I say we're not leaving the room to we put together a climate action fund that helps less developed countries not have to build a coal fired power plant\nAnd we should stop every single coal fired power plant in the world from being ville [noise]\nThat's what we have to do why the dirtiest field in the world and it is the single biggest culprit with respect to global climate change and we're at a point now where we are locked in not just to preventing this from happening were locked in the mitigation adaptation so we're going to have to do things like the Dutch do\nTo prevent the sea from coming into the country this below sea level but guess what a lot of other places have got to find that challenge already the mayor of Miami is pumping water out of Miami Beach\nAnd the mayor of Miami Beach that mine is pumping water out in order to get sunny day high tide flooding out of the way\nSo we have water coming over the Boston I'm In in in Boston at the seat will you know that comes in at a high tides any day now so my friends long answer to you but I got to tell you something this is one of the most serious issues we face is actually central is solvable\nThere was no excuse for not moving more rapidly to alternative renewable energy solar is now completely competitive with call it's cheaper than coal because there's no there's no truth in accounting I don't know how many of your business\nBut you know there's no truth in accounting and in

San\nSo if in fact our ability to accomplish the things that the federal level is impaired at this point there's a certain amount of us thought that states are going to have to take the lead a and I think that's Jerry Brown the attitude and he's just a announced a\nWasn't born in the United states let me think about this if that's what a party is reduced to and its purpose\nThat's the problem and that comes from people it comes from people I think it started a little bit with Richard Nixon and the southern strategy and Dick Viguerie and direct mail names from the past but it extended and and went further and both parties have made contributions to it\nAnd fights that took place in the Senate for one reason or another their arguments about what happened to John Tower nominated circulated sense their arguments about what happened to Robert Bork blah blah blah\nBut really it took hold in the Nineteen nineties where the Gingrich revolution people but I saw it as people began to come over

Hampshire\nThey they supported Gene McCarthy they send a message to the president nine states Lyndon Johnson\nYou shouldn't run again and it was after the march primary that Lyndon Johnson took himself out of it so look at what I set about Earth Day look at what I said about environmental legislation look at what happened in terms of accountability for Watergate and then the Watergate babies who went to Congress and what we were able to do\nSo yeah it moves slowly sometimes it's not as responsible as you'd like to be Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of government except for everything else think about it we've tried everything in the world ladies and gentlemen\nWe've had dictatorships all over the place where the monarchs for a while here till we threw off the yoga that we've had constitutional monarchy we've had parliamentary Marta ... we've had socialism communism we've had\nYou name it we've we've we've seen it experimented with one place or another and I still believe very very deeply that if you work at it properly and then the public is able to hold people and things accountable and you go vote\nOr you can make a difference and here's the magic number fifty four point to that is the percentage of eligible Americans who voted in twenty sixteen when ... was elected in two thousand and eight it was sixty two\nPoint three percent when he was reelected against Romney it was\nFifty eight point five I think so you see the gap the story of the last election is not the people who did go out to vote for Donald Trump's people who didn't vote and nine percent of Iraq Obama's vote went to Trump and seven percent did not come out and vote that's sixteen percent\nThat swing that's why I Believe as I sit here today I'm not kidding you I'm not a Pollyanna air ... I'm not being naive\nWe can make our democracy work but it is work it's hard work you have to go out and be part of a campaign you have to drive people to go vote you have to go vote yourself you've got to give money to campaign so it can compete you've got to take part in it\nAnd and ... I I just ask you remember the words of Ben Franklin\nWhen he walked down the steps of constitution hall after they had finished their labor on the next generation of the constitution the United states and a woman shouted at him Dr Franklin tell us what do we have and he said back to her oh she said do we have a monarchy or republic and he said a republic if you can keep it\nIf you can keep it that's the work of today I kid you not\nJohn McCain you've talked about other colleagues in the Senate Republican and I all across her at times you had a long relationship he leaves your fellow Vietnam veteran what do you have to say about John McCain and how how you worked with him and and your relationship with him\nThe years what am I missing as as I think America will miss him because he was a a truth teller\nA he knew he had some deviations himself one was on climate change when he was running for president because of the orthodoxy of this party and he was up front about those kinds of things which is one of the things people appreciate that about him but he had a as I wrote in an op ed after he passed away he had a great capacity for forgiveness\nWhich is which is partly what you need and what we need and our politics a little bit in the country\nJohn and I didn't know each other and well when we went to the sun I got to the Senate before John to try not to let him forget any given day as about two years apart and he came to campaign against me Massachusetts though he never attacked me never mentioned by name you just talked with the other guy I write in the book about how that so that was the way the game was played back then not any more but then\nBut in the Senate we were one day\nWe're on a delegation flying to Kuwait after the desserts\nStreaming of New England

solar\nTalked to the troops and thanked them but also to talk to the mirror and the other folks and see where we were going John and I were seated opposite each other he was flying backwards I was lying forward sitting opposite him which were assigned by seniority that's why it was important and I got there before and\nUh and we started you know we we were uncomfortable little bit because I was the war protester and he was a POW so we started to talk about the navy navy guys and we both love the navy I loved the navy didn't like war but love the navy\nAnd we talked about I I asked him about Annapolis and what it was like to have a grandfather and a father\nFor star admirals the weight of that what did that affect him in the in the in the academy and blah blah blah\nSo we had an amazing conversation that night but out of it came a\nWillful determine commitment by the two of us which we made that night on that plane\nThat we were going to work together because we both agreed that the war was still tearing America apart Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Ninety One and so we decided we're going to work together to try to make peace peace with the non\nAnd peace with ourselves in America and it began with the sort of ability to look beyond how we felt about each other's positions on the war he was pro war he he came back as an upset at the people who are protesting the war because his war stopped the day was shot down Nineteen sixty seven\nAnd he had to hang on everything he had and believe for all those years in prison camp\nMy war was Nineteen sixty eight sixty nine\nAnd when I came back I got to go around the country and argue against the war so we came from very different places\nBut my friends we we found the most amazing common ground we worked together\nFor ten years to try to change going on we ought to believe did when he first with George Herbert Walker Bush we lifted the embargo with President Clinton weighed normalized ah we're we we mostly ... answer the questions for seven hundred families to date about what happened to their loved ones in Vietnam\nBecause we set up the most in depth intrusive accountability system\nTo be able to know what happened to somebody in a last scene last known alive report and there was a mythology remember in the early Nineteen nineties the cover of Newsweek had are they still alive prisoners in Vietnam and tiger cages and there was a mythology took the Rambo fu films that\nWe'd forgotten people over there so we have to undo that first and we went to amazing lengths to do it we went back to Vietnam I went back with John McCain\nWe we we add helicopters flying into hamlet sway the sound of the helicopter would bring back horrible memories of the war we we had a history houses we'd go in and talk to the ... we actually interviewed general job and we interviewed the jailers of John McCain and his fellow prisoners so we had this most exhaustive\nEffort and in the end ladies and gentlemen I'm so proud that that that not only be get the answers and that's ongoing today today is we're sitting here in this theater we got American Soldiers on the ground and now I'm trying to get remains back for families\nAnd and John McCain and I visited the cell he was in together we stood together and and I realized then that we had found this special common ground\nAnd if a POW at a protest or can do that about Vietnam in Hanoi we can do that anywhere in this country and make things better so it's a great story about what people could\n[noise] um [noise]\nTurning to another Asian country with which we
