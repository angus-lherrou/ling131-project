know you've been thinking about your questions that you can sum it up here to ask Mr Williams and I'll just sort of get us started but I really wanted to just give him an opportunity to sort of just give us a a synopsis of the book from the outset in his own words as to what sort of motivated him and and\nWhat I'm all went into play when he thought about this book the writing of it um and just sort of the whole engagement with the ... as compared to maybe other books that you've written\nA professor Taylor it's a pleasure to have you with me in pleasure to be here at the commonwealth\nClub thanks to all of you for coming out this afternoon [noise] this is a tricky subject because racist so waited in our society for so many centuries not just in the current uh look\nBut the reality is that we are at a critical moment so normally for me\nTo answer to an answer to your question professor I have been a tremendously interested in the history of civil rights in the United states in the bigger as the people who have\nBeen central to promoting social change on the most difficult issue of race so I've written a biography of Justice Marshall as you look back at eyes on the prize you can see that I'm very interested in people who were change agents in this society so I'm Talking about\nPeople like you know Chaney Goodman and Schwerner going down south in Freedom Summer Nineteen sixty four who are these people who put themselves at risk for the greater good and in that case become martyrs to the cause but in this moment\nI don't think there's much question that if you look at where we are as Americans with regard to race you'd say you know in the words of Charles Dickens that was the best of times and it was the worst of times\nIn the sense that it's the best of times you know in my lifetime just ten years ago we saw the election of a black president a black man is president of United States in my lifetime\nWe've seen the first black billionaire we've seen people emerge or in terms of the coach from you in a way that it's unimaginable people from Michael Jackson to Kendrick Lamar ah we've seen people from Denzel Washington to Jennifer Hudson would Academy Awards\nOr you know we've seen the first sharing the joint chiefs of staff the first secretary of state African Americans it's I could keep going in this way it's really been an incredible period of tremendous gains\nAnd most of all maybe the gain in terms of the black middle class in this country and again in terms of black political power right now we have a record number of black people serving in the U.S Congress\nRecord number of women serving in the U.S Congress so we've seen tremendous progress but at the same time when you ask people today\nAbout the current state of race relations in the country right now people say that worse race relations are worse than they've ever been right now half of the American people forty nine percent say the president\nIs a racist including eleven percent of Republicans so you've come to think what what has happened how could it be that we have such tremendous progress such tremendous growth in terms of the black middle class black political voice black political opportunity record numbers of graduate\nStraining of New England public radio is funded by you land or western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nYou and I both know the answer has to do with the rise of Donald Trump Trump who comes on the political scene with the birther movement saying that the first black president wasn't even an American that he's an illegitimate president\nSome kind of Machiavellian candidate Donald Trump who then comes down to the golden escalator at Trump Tower and begins calling Mexicans rapists and criminals Donald Trump who goes on in terms of the kind of rhetoric that he uses to\nTalk about a black woman as a dog to talk about NFL players who Neal in protest the police brutality during the anthem as s obese who should be fired\nA Donald Trump who says at one point that are on American born judge a Mexican parents cannot be fair to him can't do his job causing the speaker of the house Republican Paul Ryan to say that was the epitome of a racist statement\nThis is Donald Trump\nAnd he has successfully appealed\nTo white anger and fear in this society\nEven as the society is becoming more diverse and especially as we've seen an increase in the number of immigrants so he has become a force of the vision racial division ... division in terms of class in terms of so many\nAh points subdivision in this society he has been willing to exploit for political advantage\nSo I'll stop there but\nAt the same time you you ground his own orientation in the anti she'd party\nOf of the Republican Party itself and that you kind of outlined the ways in which there he's not the first one and he sort of not an outlier maybe in terms of his lack of the courtroom but in terms of the substance of his ideas you put him along the continuum of\nApollo there is a continuing to be but what you have to understand is that since the sixties since the passage of the sixty four civil rights act since the passage of the sixty five voting rights act as you know at that point President Johnson says we've lost the south now for a generation by\nThe south went from being mostly democratic to mostly Republican in the aftermath of those\nMoves and we know that President Nixon played to a southern strategy with just that in mind we know that someone like President Reagan opened his campaign by going down to Mississippi or a and going to show the county fair or the county where Goodman Chaney Goodman Schwerner were killed\nUm LBJ was very conservative at one point you know better than I Do um one season just like Earl Warren things change he becomes the most I Would argue even more than Lincoln the most you know black friendly president in American history in terms of policy can Donald Trump's personal racism\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven like to see\nI I'm not quite in other words ... there'll be racist and he did more for blacks than any other president in American\nHistory I don't I Can't Donald Trump I think that I think we have to say on this yeah because I think LBJ came from Texas came out of that Dixiecrat whole attitude in tradition a but he is someone who would work I think he was a school teacher in fact right with\nA Mexican children down in border communities he had a sense of that and I think he had a sense\nOf feeling as if he\nCould be larger than life he could be a liberator and that in the winter and Barry Goldwater was that way too while he beat Goldwater remember and he he pilloried go water for his racial attitudes around the civil rights so that's why I resist the parental care of your question I'm OK\nOkay um so this question do you find it difficult to talk about race relations while Trump is in office while you're working on Fox News [laughter] [noise]\nWell [noise] I can tell you I I think if this was a a different kind of our inside rip off my shirt show you show your car and you know because\nIt's so difficult to have\nMeaningful conversations about race\nEspecially with my colleagues are fun\nI mean the good thing about Fox's that I'm there there's a number one cable channel in America and it's an opportunity I think the parents the bubble in to say hey there's a different perspective and a different experience of life and here it is to to me I'm In the arena on a daily basis and\nAnd so the attitudes and the questions that I have to cope with and that kind of onslaught because I'm the exception not part of the mainstream or it can be heavy\nBut it's just a different reaction when you're in Studio ... is one phenomena that happens to you but when you go out the door\nThere's a whole nother reality in terms of how people perceive Judea logically I think it is you were saying that you were saying that sort of when you out of the studio that oh you mean like representative of a sort of liberal perspective in in in in Studio if I'm not mistaken\nWell no I I mean obviously if I'm Talking to Sean Hannity on not I'm not that kind of he inserted anyway so you must be the liberal because things are concerned but it's like that I just give you that as an extreme example but I mean what you ... you know in my life\nI think people have often tried to pitch in home you are you left you write right now where do you fit in there and that was my question to an end in and and so many areas you know it just becomes a question because I say you know what\nI think their policies that have not been productive I think we need to for example I wrote a book called enough ... which was about the failures of black leadership in this time you know black leadership not going after critical issues like\nWhy do we have a community is the devil by drug dealers want we aren't there protesting the drug dealers\nOr why aren't we going after the problem of poor quality schools why don't we more aggressive and saying these schools are not serving argument his best interest as opposed to seeing them as simply providing jobs again often times in the black community but\nFailing the black children and I think that's that's short term a short sighted thinking oh you know so on so many levels I'm willing to question the leadership and then people say well that means you must be conservative no I'm just trying to tell you\nI think we have to hold political leaders to account black white Asian Latino if they're not serving the community call 'em out but again that's more outside the studio but at the studio where I work for Fox right I Am position then and posturing there as the lesson\nButton on this other questions related says I Love you on the five but how do you prepare for the antics put downs and nonsensical tunes of Jesse waters\nAnd I ... and I fast forward through most of what he says and see I'm a wrong or see playing a role or is he just and immature resentful person\nWhile Jesse and I have a chance to come speak to this artist\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nInterview and finds that\nFor him there are people who are big supporters and people who find his uh his kind of presentation entertaining and it becomes entertainment but I think it's entertainment that sometimes is at a\nCost and a two perceptions of common destiny and common interest and common commonality as American\nRelated question Mr Williams how do you maintain your civility working with your colleagues at Fox News who consistently support an echo actions in words of such despicable and the legitimate a of a of a despicable and they're legitimate president [laughter]\nWell again I have to\nCope with the idea that so many of my colleagues are in fact on the Trump bandwagon a and I'm willing to challenge it and to speak out against it and again if my hat's\nOff to the idea that I'm there and the audience for the most part likes me so that's a you know that that's a shock in some ways\nMhm mhm [noise] that's a question for you to sleep [noise] um do you\nThink African Americans should join with Latinos or Hispanics et cetera to be a bigger voting bloc and how do you get participation significantly higher well\nI think that what you have to do is make it seem urgent\nMhm uh and people have to see that it's directly impacts their lives now we're coming up on these midterm elections and historically minority communities educating people and Democrats do not turn out in high numbers mhm\nBut I think that because this has become something of a referendum on Trump and because of Trump's behavior including a lot of his racist behavior\nI think there is a sense of urgency and I think you're going to see a larger turnout in terms of the consequences\nSo this was all about your life my life\nOur communities our families\nAnd when people feel that politics makes a difference I think you see them become activated too often they felt you know what it doesn't make a difference that you know the Democrats might take you for granted\nA and the Republicans might ignore you but what we have now is a situation where people feel that they are being demonized and belittle\nOr and hopefully that does create a common set of issues that drive them to the polls\nYou write with a sense sense of urgency and that was the question I was going to ask you this book is written with a sense of urgency and\nI you know I've been around you know the last thirty forty years listen to people talk about this concept of race war and nobody takes it has ever taking it seriously when you see Bannon out in Italy I'm Steve Miller in the in the White House um do you take the concept of race was seriously at all I don't know what what you mean\nThe idea that there was this projection I think it was ... CEO se that had written a book called the coming ... this whole idea that race is coming and with the president sort of you know slapped fanning the flames that you're saying he's full of fanning\nDo you take that concept that we're going to Balkan either as a society with these racial divisions in terms of violence\nOr no I don't think that's coming I think that you have episodes where there's racial violence in the country and people act out or it can be somebody\nUh you know in terms of we see it with all too frequent a ... regular with all too much regularity of you know the police shooting somebody and saying why didn't you shooting setter in fear of black men and all the rest coming to the forefront but no I think that the nation is on a different track professor which is that we're becoming more diverse and\nAh and in my lifetime or you know I like in the book I say you know Trump is Seventy two I'm sixty four and\nKnow eight years different but we've lived through this tremendous change in America but he seems to have missed what I saw happening right right and the growth and the black middle class for example\nTo me is the most important thing that's happened in my life not right right I mean to compare my life and my father as I say in the back that if\nYou know my father lived in in his life was defined by his race in terms of where he lived his neighborhood\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nNeighborhood if he said you know what you work and have contracts with major American media white owned media you write books for white publishers a you know if he saw that his granddaughter my daughter was a graduate of Georgetown University law school who didn't accept black people until the late\nSixties he'd say that's a different world and if he saw me at the White House having lunch and then saw that the other guy sitting there was a black man than\nAny President Obama [laughter] say oh my God I got a different universe where I Can't imagine\nThat my dad would say right right so you stop and think about these things that have happened in our lifetime but also in Trump's lifetime what an amazing thing forty percent of black America earning between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars in additional twelve percent earning between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nThat means more than half of black America is either on the edge of being\nMiddle class or solidly in it and beyond it mhm but he doesn't plug into that notion of people have sacrificed people have been in the vineyards working hard to allow this to her instead he focuses I think quite intentionally on the dysfunction that chaos and poor black communities\nThat kind of go back to LBJ coming about the the poorest white man and you can you know persuading him to you know that he's the negro is doing better than him he'll open up his pockets to let himself be Rob ... others\nWell I think it it's more like Dr King's statement that there are certain politicians white segregationist who are feeding them the bread of hate ... that that was what they could say to themselves that they're better than those\nPeople in the next question\nIt is increasingly difficult for you this is again a number of Fox questions so that there's a bunch here um it is increasingly difficult for you to justify your\nContinued association with Fox given how that network program being has evolved I guess somebody wants you to comment on that oh well he's not a question please explain how Fox News your affiliations supports what denies the pleas for racial harmony you original thoughts about\nSolutions so I guess people want to know about you and and your relationship to Fox 'cause this here in many different forms\nWell as I said earlier to me I think that Fox as such a major platform in American media the number one cable news station in the country\nOr is unimportant venue to have somebody come in in ... burst the bubble and have someone come in and offer\nA different set of perspectives in fact ... so I find myself challenging so many of their top personalities and I'm I'm there every day uh and no one is telling me what to say so to me this is an opportunity it comes at a tremendous cost 'cause I feel a beat up much of the time\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications that day pass dot edu thing\nWhat I Want to say and trying to reach and it's very interesting to pick up on a point I meant and ... I mentioned in passing earlier than that there's so much oftentimes positive response from people that people will say to me at a ball game and the airport and the trains whatever they will say to me you know\nI don't agree with your politics but I like you and I like the fact that you're there you know when I go to the water fountain and I run into people it's not that I haven't heard the other side of the argument and so I'm performing a function there as a foil but I think also as a\nA source of a different perspective\n... I'm this is kind of a funny one and says you used to be six for you take such a pounding every night on fire [laughter] um let's see ah there's a what would you have again that was the repeated when\nDo you think former President Obama was a pot was a net positive or or for race relations he famously believes he was ten to Twenty years too early Obama well you'd think Obama was on the net positive for race relations\nOh I Do uh I think you know looking back on the Obama presidency boy you know I see people and T shirts that simply said the miss me now\nAnd I think that that's very rare water contrast in terms of a class that lack of scandal and all the rest I mean I Can't imagine if President Obama had been involved with a porn star\nHas been you know paying off people lying is his first national security advisor or had pled guilty his campaign manager\nI think I think he would be long be gone I think he will not eat and\nHe will his nominee had this scandal that we see with ... why does I\nI just don't think there's any point of comparison\nBut there's questions related to this obviously political pressure and negative media attention don't change Trump's mind or behavior so what we'll do you think he will win a second term what will change Trump and we'll win again\nOkay I think they're two separate issues one is I don't think there's any changing the Seventy two year old man and a who tells people he's a stable genius [laughter] so\nI I I leave it alone\nAnd I don't I don't I think we've gone past that point they say you can only change people when they're in diapers and I think that definitely applies to Trump [noise]\nUm [noise] as to whether he might win re election well his numbers are just terrible even now um and they creep up at times and there was some good news for the Republicans this week in terms of\nApproval of the party was I think it forty seven just like slightly above Democrats at forty six in one Gallup poll but if you look at for example\nA generic party preference when it comes to this election Democrats haven't\nBeen able to pull away but they still maintain a strong a margin advantage end when it comes to engagement in energy among the voting base\nDemocrats really have a strong advantage going into these midterms so when it comes to the twenty twenty race\nI think it'll have to do with who the Democrats are able to nominate and exactly how\nYou engage Trump because I think that's very difficult as we saw in the Republican primaries if you try to say hey this guy knows very little this guy you know as someone who says outrageous things cause people names like cetera uh it's not not necessarily effective with his base\nSo his base is likely to nominate him again I don't know if John Kades sake or\nWhoever on the Republican side might hold out and challenge him and I think that's possible\nBut I don't see that person prevailing but once it comes to a general election I think if the Democrats have someone who's able to not only take on Trump but to contrast offer contrast in terms of political stability mhm\nAnd political experience to Trump and uh I think I think Trump's in big trouble\nYeah wow that's that's I think that's news um [noise] what is your perspective on rising uses of smoke a little bit about it but what is your perspective on rising social economic inequality increase housing education\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches\nDot com and also they want to know how related to that how you feel about Bernie Bernie Sanders\nWell I think that let's deal with the first part in the rising income inequality and how it impacts minorities in the country remember as I was saying to you earlier you have for the first time in American society a sizable black middle class\nThis to me is a tremendous achieve and I think the two major achievements of the civil rights movement one is that economic stability but secondly would be political voice [noise]\nUm and we touched on that with ... with Obama but also record number of blacks and Congress and the like black mayors are right now you have the possibility of a black governor or in Florida in Georgia to Maine Maryland right you know these are amazing it is so I mean\nThis is again part of the growth and I think you know I don't see how you hold back that wave of change that sleeping America\nIt's almost like Trump is happening up here but then something else going on with women and with minorities electorally are across the country\nWell see I wouldn't I wouldn't exclude whites I think everybody catered whites I think people\n... you know and it and after the failure of the Trump tax cuts yeah I think there are people who are working class whites who say you know I don't I don't see it I don't know what's going to again that that plays into what's going on in the midterms but you asked about how this impacts then the black middle class and well I think that if you look at it the question is how\nI think the question that would come from the black community to any president is what are you doing\nTo help that black middle class grow and in particular\nIn particular to overcome the wealth gap so that even as you have a stronger black middle class than ever before they remains a tremendous differential in terms of the wealth in terms of\nPeople buying houses stocks dividends property investments that attends a attaches to the white community and its absent in the black community so it's more the kind of paycheck to paycheck and people coming along slowly\nThat is the big difference in what I began to reiterate Trump is taking away some of those government supports that were put in place to encourage entrepreneurship to encourage\nOr the growth of that black middle class one other point on this this one from comes in and says he's going to drain the swamp he starts cutting government\nRemember Bush comes in Obama comes in and they are repositioning were forming government but at the same time you see small increments and government for minorities disproportionate share of minorities working\nFor government state local but also federal government I think it's like thirty three percent more of a likelihood for minorities ... because a bias in the private sector difficulties\nIn private sector employment mhm so when he's whacking if that's when he's freezing payments for government workers when he's taking away tax base from local and state government\nHe's impacting that black and Latino middle class in a very real way mhm mhm\n[noise] um this is another question during the Clarence Thomas\nI forgot one thing was about Bernie Sanders yeah how do you feel about Bernie thank you and again I think Sanders it's so interesting there's a real commonality if you look at the numbers between so many Trump voters and Sanders voters they're populous yeah and they want someone thing of disruption in terms of American politics\nUm but again the difference is that for the Sanders\nVoters base the government as having a role and they do not believe that simply by giving more to the rich\nThat you are going to solve these problems like Elizabeth Warren and the consumer financial protection born you know Trump comes in and he wants to do away with that in the argument that he would make is this is over regulation burdensome on business\nWarren and Sanders make the case no what we see is big business in fact exploiting mhm taking advantage of people who are hard working Americans of all colors and um and I think that's where the divide comes between the Sanders and the Trump ah\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional gross through its member coaches coaches profiles
