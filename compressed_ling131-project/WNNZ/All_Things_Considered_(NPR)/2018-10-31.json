China's scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China and one day he went on line to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nYou put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it on on on these days than the person is on the ... list from the cart\nLoved one was confused why couldn't he took the train ticket he started looking into this situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loud one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nJulie one thing that comes along with the ... list are on track to Brazil is that uh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the blacklist about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business she would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud long went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face\nLike up on a big billboard\nAnother in more than be electric grain by the side of the plaza\nThere are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures and that's why it's like a picture of her on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town she says whenever he went out\nWhenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone who knew\nFor a lot of money ... ... oh my God this Orson we must be working in the same industry as I Do it all now up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list\nTo she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nBut what I thought what job I was actually\nThe the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant and people that think why are you sure been happy why do you still have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loved ones that he was paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so\nStill about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked to ... and trying to deal with this and by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt while it's technically possible but it just never seems\nTo happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this
