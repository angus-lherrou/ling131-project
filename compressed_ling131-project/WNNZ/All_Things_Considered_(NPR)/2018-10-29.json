department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants Shonda see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise said something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still we still do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more ... uh barriers more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well ... that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own way to support role again and the plus he ... his law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used and former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others uh we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you'd get from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers

accounts Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut said success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the ...\nIf you put it in a murder mystery framework or who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kids to school\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation and more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo ... says the Philips curve isn't working\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS in higher education administration enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay path dot edu\nDuring the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSetting for pale the fellow\nIt might be resting [noise]\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty

looking at what\nThe feels it's curved could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill in the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one\nTo two different ways in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want Rowan stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that will confirm your belief about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me
