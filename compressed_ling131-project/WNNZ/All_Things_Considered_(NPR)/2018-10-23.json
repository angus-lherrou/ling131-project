know about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimist about the lottery I don't even try any more men I'm actually risk averse only leave any like does anyone think they're really gonna win mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex called American from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken ... visit him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars to buy all the shares a lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plan was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo yeah\nHe says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifties to find ... has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I live in a I mean like the M. sixteen ... among which was good shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we'd pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two thousand shutting down there than they could easily which was about a TV show\nOr a big score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I one time\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so he set his sights on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one difference keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in\nSo his secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nI knew that would be ... ... six second Brian move on but the ... to the un thousands mind writer\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAll right to to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls\nUm some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business um what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged\nUh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen\nWe're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are on the role\nSome cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person has and voted and two in three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically were also saying that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act and be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling is voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it

I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed or very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n... is head of NYU's Brennan centers
