I'm ousted Chang\nWe're going to go now to a region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because of this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a buyer bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble or these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal

hope helped strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nTo share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing what's\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream\nAnd try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nAre really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you\nHave a super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it

remain I think an important security partner of ours\nBut should President Trump has been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners is probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever and and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mine does that concern you\nYou know we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners uh they provide as

the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to his little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a by your bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think\nOf mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nMentioned program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble or these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first\nAnd also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicide\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier\nIn classrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grade [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... in the lunchroom taping note cards to wall\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friends\nHow a friend is help them through tough times lily points up to her son the crowded wall\nSupporting and keeping them positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that and say what they're going through so they don't feel like getting\nLily has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength ... with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad's suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt cuts to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps people hope I don't mind sharing\nWhat's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to\nTackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people in the front lines sound confident that this was going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like schools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news
