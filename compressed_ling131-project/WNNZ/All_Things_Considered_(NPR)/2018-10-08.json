for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise] it's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at\nOur bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good an in house a cue or is this technology to answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it was there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed wider use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images that when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better\nAt the task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of her particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement can use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nUm is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas\nStreaming of New England
