fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as of drug dealers\nThere is a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president's condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it

things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prisoner rules NPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week\nToday NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors finding shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different\nInside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from Don ... depending on what level there and that's the word and it showed Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community is right now are her outside and our yard with ... and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war and is the first the point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get discipline that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR in ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's in men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions ... big consequences women get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain my ... um\nThat's the word and show dumb in two thousand sixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared to men that other presidents were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom ... corrections officers to give out fewer tickets for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this is a gang related it's just women\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place to practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different pass the prison they're less

are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I can see the institution so I'm not so much shame [noise] you know and it's helped me with my own my own shame in my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different\nWomen are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so the air force so here and then friends\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years and my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that has been chain for months at a time in the basement sold his property\nVictims is the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said as a war and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the print and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six cannot cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old

believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae BP woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent

interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well do you not\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your foot\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools and ask and applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\nAllies often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state\nSenate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city":
