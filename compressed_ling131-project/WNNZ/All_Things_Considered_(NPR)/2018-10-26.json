hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down and two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here see most ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what does the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the summer and fall here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nI'm not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people always great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and then we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck current workplace\nPolicies at eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nBut everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGrew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes it's very much so I noticed once I live in an actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant close\nDid the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I that point was used to being independent\nWe're so much about last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first at the hotel north Hampton get you're glad rags owners get your tickets today at NPR are done that\nOnce doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today where ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life and being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nAre running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead at wired nights terror haunted thrill heart hating runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off Nakhle to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself of seems like a fantasy world or something in there you know the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay draws a six hurting freeway with\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting his past\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left that\nWe liked the trees like the leaves on the street it's kinda cool kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur cars are driving by themselves crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo\nUnited Auto workers and the name of the union chapter that Skidmore represented\nLocal seven thirty five\nWe have so

fair the cable network can criticize him but that when he pushes back they say he's not being presidential\nAnd about that election how does the president address all day flip that on the horizon\nWell that's where it might be watching to see because you know here's what the present had to say at the White House this afternoon\nI promised to be a president for all Americans and the amazing results that we've all achieved you've achieved you've helped us so much in your communities incredible but the results really speak for themselves\nAt a campaign rally earlier this week the president was self consciously dialing back as partisan rhetoric but you know he's got another rally in North Carolina at night it wouldn't be surprised to see him pick the muzzle often deliver more full throated partisan message\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley at the White House Scott thank you You're welcome\nMean meanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America ... north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fears release depressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean has reportedly dropped by half from seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north it gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary Houston Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which people forced their way across the border that could be shot at\nWe can't have any intention right now to ... well the apprehended however a ... officer an attack at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious they can't have the ability of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico a Sikh he'll sell US cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leaders from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know and

and that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet or tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration release numbers earlier this week and they really are startling\nIn July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase that's a huge\nGrowth how our border agents handling math\nSo a border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that\nRight the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with a travel ban and he'll give that his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News in\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong case thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate three point five percent string quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports they were assigned to potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate and the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast my life that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent at it and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out in restaurants more Eli Maloof is America's CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and Kim didn't among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nOr set records around Labor Day an immoral David share in fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for for trip spending more with us\nIt wasn't just people who were spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular was high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy all that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com right\nFor all the good news and today's reports there were some disquieting signs\nBusiness investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight ten ... percentage point a meager number despite the big cuts indigenous taxes there was little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see them headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen business and consumer spending over time and they're already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets jacko also cites a gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia\nMeanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wean by next year ... says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see so much slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what ... calls are growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact\nThat will have but for now Americans are working and
