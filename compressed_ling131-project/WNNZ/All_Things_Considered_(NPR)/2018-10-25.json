on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I I I'm

hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized [noise]\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now\nNPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hit or David Hey Audi so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with a several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say [laughter]\nYou get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on a black person and puts on white [laughter] that was okay as long as you address another character\nAnd then of course at tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a two for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from El Ruger he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShows a bigger apology to folks color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to perhaps the newest co host of today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line but this was political correctness run among um that's silly and junior ... is just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been\nAiling uh it's got rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nThings aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a cool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall and a ...\nAt that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor that also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey gene ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear round um we do every year in quotes which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not all the way the advent Halloween is Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out and maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people I talked to in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people as lazy as animal is to play caricatures the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black [noise]\n\nSo there's a whole history of you know read these portrayals of Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American the rate of ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy sit against\nThat and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people in misery shows who are not wearing black because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance is not a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white paint over to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context we always start in a historical vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you've raise it more is this something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party me about an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with a different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co

communications officer with the un refugee agency thank you for speaking with us from ...\nWell President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump is threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north what about\nThe problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now\nWants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools and as a creative non fiction writing enrolling no for August twenty seventh applications at bay

things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThan we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups and then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now\nTransnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those links\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand and tell the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them that\nI Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America\nMake those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations thanks so much\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe cerebellum is a part of the brand that his best known for helping us keep our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain it may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and do some bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of those day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effortless\n... says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work and make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brain\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay paths dot edu\nSays the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nWe're already thought that the cerebellum is cruel that most people thought but these results for re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's why scientists to neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd those are not says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation father bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking start brother editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened over time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of serve but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that are involved and cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder all have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that
