actually it was done in radar we didn't realize that you know it during World War two so it was quite a few years before we did it again and optics but it is the idea that if you really want to a huge a force on something like an electron electric field you need a the peak power\nAnd peak powers energy per unit time and at the time of a CPA invention you could have either big energy lasers or you could have short pulse lasers but if you put a short pulse through this enormous the electric field actually destroyed the amplifier so you couldn't have both\nAnd so the idea of tripped false amplification is if your church the pulse and that word ... comes from a birds chirping 'cause they changed the frequency in time as a buffer down at it really means that all the different colors of the light travel faster or slower especially down like something like a fiber\nSo that the rest of the colors came first and the blue earth came longer later and so we the original lazy is one and a

now to NPR code of ethics requires accountability and reporting and every reporter is responsible for the content of their stories and has to be able to explain their decisions to the public\nEvery reporter is responsible for all of the lines in their story every fact that's listed every number\nGoes on if you if you kept reading and says she actually can't point to any specific instance like that\nUm the quote that jumped out at me was ... was a sloppy drunk and I know because I drank with him um there's also I don't\nI don't I I Do not think that's a fair characterization\nAnd this back and forth for people who are looking for\nBrett Kavanaugh not being fully truthful about his drinking this this back and forth would be where you would find that uh there have been a lot of people who've come forward and said\nThey think that actually was a pretty fair characterization I should add though that the White House has delivered to me statements from a couple of people who Kavanaugh went to college with including a sweet mate\nWho says that he saw cabinet and not just at the end of the night but also in the morning and said that he did not see behavior that involved blackouts or anything at the level that has been described\nBy others so what do you make of these dueling narratives that we heard represented by President Trump and Senator Schumer having listened\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you a big university graduate schools MS in higher education administrator ... rolling for October twenty second applications at ... dot edu\nLying to Congress would not be acceptable but President Trump does not believe that Kavanaugh lied to Congress he believes in and talking to people at the White House who are working on Kavanaugh's nomination they believe that in cabinet opening statement that clip that we played earlier where he says\nI drank to access I drank a lot of beer I liked to be here and I did things that I look back on and cringe that that although it is broad and not specific\nCovers just about everything they say you know he admits to everything except blacking out and when it comes to blacking out that is much more difficult to answer definitively\nIs all of this likely to have an impact on the three or so senators who appear to be on the fence\nIt's hard to know a those three Republican senators say that they are waiting for the FBI investigation to come through they keep getting asked in hallways by reporters whether lying matters to them but\nYou know the definition of lying may be different from Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are predisposed to have concerns about this nomination than it is from Republicans and\nPresident Trump and Kavanaugh's backers who say this started with sexual assault and now you're talking about whether he is through a drink at somebody at a bar in at Yale\nNPR's Tamara Keith thanks a lot of time You're welcome\nThe political firestorm over Brett Kavanaugh has raised lots of questions about how judicial nominees are evaluated but could lead to changes in the process NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been posing those sorts of questions to lawyers who've been responsible for vetting judges carry joins us now he carried I also\nSo but the judge has already have to complete a pretty thorough and very long questionnaire is it surprising at the White House didn't touch any of these allegations of sexual misconduct and Brett Kavanaugh's case it's true that judge candidates gas a bunch of questions known in shorthand as the\nSex drugs and rock and roll Russians [laughter] things like did you abuse alcohol or drugs did you have a wrap sheet what about financial improprieties but those questions usually started age Eighteen and go forward\nIn this allegation by Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh\nHappened when he was Seventeen years old to be clear Kavanaugh has denied any sexual misconduct but\nThere were plenty of hints about his use of alcohol from that high school yearbook injury to his fraternity at Yale which was known for rockets parties to his own speeches once he got on the federal appeals court here in Washington DC words like what happened at Georgetown Prep state of Georgetown Prep\nIn a time in a speech when he reminisced about a baseball outing at Yale where people stumble drunk off the bus in the pre dawn hours I mean what could what is happening with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation lead to changes in the way the FBI conduct background investigations in the future you think\nThe lawyers I've talked to have pointed out the system has adapted in the past for instance in the Nineteen nineties\nQuestions about paying taxes for landscapers and babysitters came up after some nominee right for cabinet positions ran into trouble\nBoys in gray who handle judge nominations for President George H W. Bush told me that the I might go back deeper into nominees background into high school for instance but he says when it comes to allegations of sexual assault the situation is complicated\nSure scary thought that one allegation was low but you know a ... home there's nothing for you choose to look at ... and you just love it\nNow it's important to say that supporters of Christine Blasey Ford say she does remember several key details about that night in Nineteen eighty two and then another accuser Deborah Ramirez has come forward with concerns about Kavanaugh at Yale\nBrett Kavanaugh he has made it clear that he has already been through six separate background checks for government jobs over the years do we know of any of his background checks revealed allegations for anything that's been mentioned so far what were they caught any of those reports those background check reports\nAnd you're doing two tickets to Hamilton from an e P R you could win two great seats at the Boston opera house and dinner afterwards that eastern standard enter now in any P. R. dot net\nBy Republicans have said they did not capture a whiff of sexual impropriety when it came to Brett Kavanaugh and we do know that there are some clues that Kavanaugh was asked about his finances maybe some other allegations in a private hearing what the Senate Judiciary committee this year but that hearing\nHas remained mostly private I reached out to Ron Klain who helped President Bill Clinton that judges planes that there could be another issue the White House counsel's office under Donald Trump is under staffed and they've been pushing through judges at a record pace\nI Wonder if it's just too many cakes and maybe they're not getting the attention they deserve\nBy contrast Ron Klain says President Clinton stop to all the other judges while he pushed through Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court but judges are central to Donald Trump's legacy and his mainly pleasing his political base so I don't expect to see a lead up there in this case All right That's NPR's Carrie Johnson thanks carry my pleasure [noise]\nThis is all things considered from New England Public radio thanks for joining us this afternoon those reports you heard there from Temer Keith and Carrie Johnson to very well thought out well edited stories that's where you count on New England public radio and NPR for\nMore than the headlines the context and analysis and historical background behind those headlines\nWere able to continue to bring you NPR programming because of contributing listeners just like yourself NPR charges of five hundred and forty\nThousand dollars every year to bring all things considered and MORNING EDITION and fresh air and all those shows so please pay your partner one eight hundred six thirty nine eighty five zero or go to any P.
