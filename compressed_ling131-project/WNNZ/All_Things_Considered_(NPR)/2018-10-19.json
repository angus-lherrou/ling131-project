by a Fifteen minute Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ... president Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence and quote if it exists\nBut Turkey's

says guy that we did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutor's office\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in Saudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes are riding well ahead of the Turkish team\nUs based turkey analyst Soner chapter I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president ... needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president

international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her walk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts about maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it\nPretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever\nYou find of course they couldn't ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S\nEvidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody in in the government and it seems that the\nUs would be willing to just go along with that and that's not a that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do those why isn't it happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France um those are

a\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district actually knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here answering the questions

way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne I Know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Jordan immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in

Napolitano and John Kerry it wasn't the as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am vouch for don't do\nThat under that logic\nIt Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on to see how they treat open\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party state may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a

Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Rock and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOf the things that always as amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we suddenly

energized he writes about projects especially those that had to do is use for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up that sort of a little

taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share and outlined reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing thing being a champion from books

already weighed in he thinks Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what\nOr this group of migrants that has now grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but ah you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala that got through that sends thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for the caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nAs I said okay I'm up for what it all but one [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front what his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still writes here near the bridge and and several of the migrants are a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to\nA couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cot marriage probably four years old has a\nHas a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom and\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them and\nAs asylum seekers and so many of them say we are not going to leave us friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico lactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border uh you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone\nA show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams

them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was on the river almost zero Republican running for real and I'm I'm here answering the questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexico\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nIn one way you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents were from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart in central immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC and the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection are struggling to see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as to approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them\nWe need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nIt Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party\nFrom the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you know the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com they treated us and\nFeel my kids you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go where they're over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party state may already be field for generations to come and\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Westfield",
