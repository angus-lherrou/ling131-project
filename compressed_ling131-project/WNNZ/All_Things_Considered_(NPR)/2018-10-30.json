is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a vote or meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates and more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country\nHow do you go around and hit\nThe women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commits reading about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThe trust by the women's march I\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty eight teams it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with\nUm everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who delivered that ... that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle Neely it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turn away from family we show what is\nWife of why\nAnd that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up math incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that what it actually missing urgency there's nothing\nI

tickets today at NPR are done minutes\nThat anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all of your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other groups feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuse says she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black woman running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the freebie seen the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds um directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day this is the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia

is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro nine outfits Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special\nCounsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia at\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make ... look back at\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of as Hey Ryan either right first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's offices you know it's usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation\nThe bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purported plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this was a very very fishy sequence of a earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against smaller so allegations that date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking from the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing\nHere the timing is indeed curious yes ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty Seventeen or a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually we're attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you

Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child from district or a boy of seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nThe budget for the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nLonger on campus from Vermont to be you're going to be now you're just fear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke the ground but we're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off and time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits\nBut there's another issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group the local population is very distrustful of the government even to this part of the day are seeing a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the

have room to the area and not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on Winona ... from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even real you know whether they're true motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which Ebola or sponsors are forced to hunker down and includes health workers who would normally be tracing any when he was had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored\nArthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't

questions facing Massachusetts voters this year\nTo date we look at question three if past age would keep in place a law passed in twenty sixteen by the legislature and signed by governor Charlie Baker that protects transgender people from discrimination in restaurants stores movie theaters and other public spaces\nThe low also requires full access in those places to restrooms in locker rooms consistent with a person's gender identity a no vote would repeal the law which critics call the bathroom bill\nAdvocates say the law protects people from discrimination opponents say the current law creates a safety issue\nJoining me to debate this referendum on match Wilder who is with the yes on three campaign\nAnd Andrew back with legal analyst for the no on three campaign which opposes the measure gentlemen thank you for joining me Andrew let's start with you since she helped bring this ballot initiative before voters\nYou'd have said that the issue is not about discrimination per se but about privacy and safety house oh\nThat's right because what this law does is it allows any man at any time to enter a woman's restroom a locker room change facility homeless shelter if they claimed to identify as male the way the law is written is very broad\nNext to impossible to enforce so we're concerned about the privacy issues that that raises on the discrimination level or the Massachusetts commission against discrimination said publicly in two thousand Fifteen as this last being debated that they already have\nThe jurisdiction over public combinations and gender identity cases so the only illegal difference when this law repealed will be that now bathrooms la Cruz places like that\nWill no longer be able to be accessed quite so easily by men of any gender identity including those who could abuse the law to prey on people mad wild well\nFirst of all I think it's really important for your audience to know that this laws about much more than ... restrooms and locker rooms it's about every place that we go every day to live our lives whether that be the coffee shop or a restaurant or the\nMovie theater anywhere that's not work schooler home and so that's what's really at stake here by repealing this law takes away those protections for transgender people and all those spaces that we all take for granted and so that's why it's so important that people vote yes on three specifically to restrooms I think that Andrew\nIs focusing on something that I think really just had to materialize and the two years since this law has been in place in fact\nThere has been no uptick in a incidence of a criminal activity sense of fallen into place and that's proven by the fact that the Massachusetts chiefs of Police Association more than fifty sexual assault prevention agencies all are in support of holding this law\nSomething tells me that if this law put women and children at risk they would not support this law\nSo if there was a report on a boss and twenty five that in ... for the targeting will bring there was a man who tried to get into the stall in a woman's room where there is a ten year old girl and the mother reporter to report the police or trying to get the details of that but that's precisely what type of scenario\nHow does the biological male enter the woman's restroom and not get stopped before he's trying to get into the store with a ten year old girl that type of ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the

violation of this law and I could face up to fifty thousand dollars in fines or a year in jail so what this law does is it silences women particular when they object to a male presence in these intimate spaces\nMatt does this law increase the likelihood that something bad could happen\nAbsolutely not in fact there is a period study out of the uh University of California law school that says there is no correlation between uptick in a criminal activity\nWhen these protections are in place but to the specific case that uh Andrew dice brought up I think it's really important for people to know nothing about this law allow anyone to enter that space any criminal activity is still a against the law and people will be arrested and charged as they should be\nWhen this law was being debated there was an attempt to amend it to prohibit registered sex offenders from making use of this law if they identified as female acclaimed identifies fame on the legislature voted that down which means you can have level two and three registered sex offenders\nClaiming a female identity and getting access to women's locker rooms homeless shelters and places like that and if anyone objects again it's the object or the parents of mom and dad who is subject to criminal penalties\nThat is a bit of a stretch a so there are penalties are in the law for sure but that's for repeated acts of discrimination over several years can be a single out over several years the laws quite clear no one has been fined under this law no and the two years it has taken place up to fifty thousand dollars\nMatt how do you all a the concerns of people who are afraid or just uncomfortable that their safety is going to be threatened well\nFirst of all I Would say we all care about a safety and privacy particularly in restaurants in locker rooms I Would not advocate for a lot to put my niece and nephews that risk and I don't think anyone who's advocating for this law would do that either what the facts tell us is that there is no correlation between protecting transgender people in public places and an up tick in criminal activity\nThere are certainly examples of of crepes going into space is that uh I think Andrew and I both agree should not be in there but this law does not allow that to happen\nIt makes it easier for them to do it because it says if anyone objects the objective is subject to criminal penalties and who should take the word of match coach air Mason done who helped filed a discrimination complaint against the female ... owner\nWho refuse declined to wax the generals or the man the man identified as female and so they filed is claiming was to what their campaign co chairs trying to do is force females for workers to wax male genitalia even though they were comfortable with it or face these fines and penalties outrageous\nAgain that's just not true that person that uh Andrus talking about a transgender woman who thought a a manicure pedicure a that's not true that that it actually en route to rent the if I read the report I read the five page Henry complaint where that man talks about transgender woman\nHe talks to his peanuts and he wants to ... and in their lives on the orange has run out of time here I did want to finally just asking Andrew back with\nThis is a law that's already on the books for two years how do we make sure that
