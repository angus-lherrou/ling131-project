men having sex as well as you'll remember from the reading what male slots cold like they've called met\nThat Sarah Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by date in which he inhabits Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former pimp from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens\nWhat do I think a prostitution shit which may um it [noise] what are you about Twenty years old age the use of my God I think of candies in my purse [laughter] and\nSarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program\nThank you for having me and us [laughter] maybe [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women with a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never went well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different\nConversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my parents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering and performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know they would sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have biggest fault on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nAnd there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh I totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in a university graduate schools and a creative non fiction writer and roll and go for August twenty seventh applications at ... dot edu\nComfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem\nI Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love kind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character you know I can remember hide that my name is probably more\nSo individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places on for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are\nLots of conversations about sex ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and we said\nVery good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit\nSo you know I really try to get my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intriguing and interfaith guilt\n[laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is in Utah white you this that and yeah I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes
