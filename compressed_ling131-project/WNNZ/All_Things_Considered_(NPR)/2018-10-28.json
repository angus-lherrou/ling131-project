in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly
