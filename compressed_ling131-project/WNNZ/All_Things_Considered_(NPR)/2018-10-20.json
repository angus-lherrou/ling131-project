citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from attacks us lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office today to uh Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this er Kobe's later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss\nThank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother as he takes three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it has been shown that when officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him um it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of some of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone you wouldn't you describe those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact that intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection as being a person of color and black men at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know she says the show and kind of between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north happen you're glad rags zone and get your tickets today anything you're done\nAnd I noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege empowered intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected as he does mental health in certain areas and connected to the race\nIn terms of how people reacted I had been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that that I had the opportunity to talk about our story and ... story is a direct result as colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who I'm saddened by other means half of his story that we needed to be told\nThat have been a a coping she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being taste by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nAnd you don't like that\nWhy are you\nKnow obviously Romney\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we're having over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess ... ... is kind of\nTipping iceberg for me it's still end up kind of steel is an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find a baby right traditions of services and police officers ship what's lost here\nIs

police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done has defied the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact\nOf course is a minimum of two hours the video was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer Europe we need to go back and mix mix it up that's why we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior

court as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's a conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us and it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts a kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah that that's exactly right so it it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to attack and\nSo they're all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create\nPipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create pipelines um the Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north happen it you're glad rags on and get your ticket today at NPR done\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fun\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close melts about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see\nWho was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating\nWhich suggests that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks busting your shows and let me just say that we realized that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne report this week that you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show\nAfter star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which for me or this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on
