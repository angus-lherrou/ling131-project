Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove into day my producer Becky solving I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it uh here in Appalachian coal\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth

they're\nAll kinds of businesses resist in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically but uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we all people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday and took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region\nIn this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged it in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them\nAnd that happened out yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just single lane\nBut that said there is now a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but they they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I

past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church and is mayor in western turkey for years and years but after\nA turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for that to attempt\nTo us at the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the drop administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that for incentives an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the

bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nHe was my attention by NPR White House correspondent

quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn\nGetting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you in the White House is all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see\nThey would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a note lasted the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things in a free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of Frida is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well food prices\nKilled is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks and the White House vending machine\nMight suddenly cost a lot more we just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets Mitt analyzes food companies including Pepsi\nAnd he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's ... looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset just more expensive can but they can't really do that right now they all live so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category alive many of the other hand categories and bad allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now\n[laughter] [noise] that's good for [noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacy Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the indicator from Planet Money [noise]\nWhat Planet Money comes from transfer wise a service that helps people send money internationally\nThree million people and businesses use transfer wise\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com transfer wise dot com or from their ...

station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I don't fit Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld with accused of mishandling several cases of abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though isn't it knowledge meant by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grows stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increased the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful\nInstitutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement\nPlays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining

the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nOr no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information using\nThe institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think\nIt's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal

he's passed around a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but\nAfter a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for that to attend\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you a yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release who pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement ... the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's districts that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric
