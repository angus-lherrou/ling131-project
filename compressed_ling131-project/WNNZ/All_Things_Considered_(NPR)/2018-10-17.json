separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland that was a real shocker\nBecause the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt playing out at that point from the perspective on at nine o'clock or not\nShe said that life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they

reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for the British and European economies and for the U.S George Parker has written about this he was a political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following those negotiations welcome back to the program ...\nIf there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe ... tons of ... kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad judge and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have

deal a tool\nThat will be quite bad and the pursuit call me will take a very big his\n... in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nWants ... to check some place where there were ... you can have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages suddenly in more distant posts from the pool so a pretty serious such as being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what would happen in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of post you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type of the board is not what

than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHit as akin to sort of an aircraft crunchy losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place in otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe is the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European exposed so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's somewhat and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nUm you name it they will they will be effective because the u._k. off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries\nBut the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all question why yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister does a deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the pause it then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial

company do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou know it's like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of late and it's all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues but one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to it in the future and then the writers who didn't you better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt interesting that we expect remorse from a company\nSo

are the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages his mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may backfire Tibet what the message is sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carry over into personal relationships that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for dinners tend to\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers and\nFlowers and candy because not only take on a whole new significance um does it has it changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] people don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main way it's changed that because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies than they would always be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile\nTo sort of

I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises the question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all in the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to Lynn Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given the straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used\nMarijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that could be grants from orange somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister true though he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister 'cause right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation of less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the

state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still

destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nAnd this is a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them were just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction

structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a goes down as you go further north in Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five miles

Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools yesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race\nKelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me well why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think ... city and I'd love to see and missions policies change not to have ... percent\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when at assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that racist sort of something that is becoming not just nearly factor but often change the fact that a decision is based on\nI think I read it saying that they do that but let's see if admissions has been showing in the past few days and has brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single response to that kind of stand if someone's catching\nStudents out there and missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yeah and I think it's scary to see this repeating in his ... his\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have university graduate schools MS and applied laboratory science at operations and rolling now for August twenty seventh applications that they passed dot edu\nAnd sort of use the personal reading to artificially keep their numbers ... although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\nI'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo\nI think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of this sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefit to that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so

evidence of life and rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland that was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older\nAnd they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our for lack of a better word they kind of look like Tobar on bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the

the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils\nSo far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet
