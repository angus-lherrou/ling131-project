NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager\nJason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot the McDonald sixteen times it was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWell acted as I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described with chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes are blank um he said that that\nThat that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can shape looking at the ... video up there and said that so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well\nI think that's hard to say that 'cause I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you must remember that in addition to this trial there than other trial related to this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald\nAt present it that night and there were reports and I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'll be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different [noise]\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on that night who and carrying the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that would require a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason
