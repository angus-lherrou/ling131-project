who said that yes he drank a lot and that he would be a very sloppy drunk\nSo how is anyone to sort this out I think that it's extremely difficult because the whole nature of this is very subjective\nIt's not the sort of thing that lends itself to fact check per se I think it's it's right there on the margins of unless the guy was\nTaken to the wrong ER and there's an official record of that\nThis is going to be extremely difficult to pin down\nJon Greenberg is a staff writer at politifact thank you very much my pleasure\nNow let's look at what the FBI is trying to find out during a week long investigation of Brett Kavanaugh\nThe president formally asked the bureau on friday to reopen its background check of the Supreme Court nominee and that means we are now three days into the probe\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here in the studio Hi Ryan either let's start with the big sticking points so far which has been the question of the scope of the investigation do we know what the FBI is looking into exactly\nWe don't exactly know what they're looking into no a Democrats as we've heard have complained that the scope of this is a kind of being curtailed reined in by the White House they say that the administration is put strict limits on what the FBI can investigate Democrat set the FBI and the White House today a list of twenty four people that they say that the bureau should or should talk to\nThe administration has pushed back against this ah they've said that uh they do want a full investigation they made clear that um they also don't want a fishing expedition\nToday the president said that he wants what he called a comprehensive an investigation he reiterated again that he wanted done quickly uh and it is the White House that has the final say on what the FBI gets to look into in this background investigation\nThat said Trump said today that well he has final say he's listening to what the Senate Republican leadership or wants to have checked out what they want looked into and then he's directing the FBI based off of what the Senate says\nAnd what has the Senate Republican leadership said they want the FBI to look into\nWell they initially said that they wanted the FBI to look into what they called credible allegations of sexual misconduct that was always a big enough kind of ill defined enough that the questions about scope word almost inevitable a on this question of senior a set of GPA pointed to comments at SUNY Senator Lindsey Graham made over the weekend\nA Graham said that the FBI would talk to witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford mentioned in her testimony last week\nThat includes Kevin O's friend mark judge a grandma also mentioned Deborah Ramirez she's the second woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin all\nThose allegations date back to their time at Yale in the early mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd those are the only people that Graham mentioned\nSo I mentioned this is day three of the FBI's week long investigation do you know much about what the FBI has been doing in those three day so far\nWith the bureau itself has not provided any uh any clarity on this but NPR has learned that the FBI has interviewed Ramirez uh she's given the FBI list of people that she says either witnessed the elected incident uh or heard about it uh contemporaneously you on that though it's it's pretty much crickets a the bureau has not reached out the Ford at this point\nIt also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick\nUh and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legend events in question when of course is Kevin O's friend mark

R. dot net\nOr to be able to hopefully slow it down long enough that each week they would say we need one more week one more wait one more week do fully win the election\nYou wouldn't want to do the investigation because they did slowing things down\nNo I don't mind and investigation as long as the investigation is it fair that is timely that it's not just designed to be able to drag on a weekend at the end of it say well now we need another week and now in another way to the Anita Hill investigation that with the FBI that time was three days\nIf the investigation is indeed confined to one week uh your colleague in Tyler Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona has said that if the FBI investigation finds that Kavanaugh lied under oath during his hearings than his nomination dead do you agree with flight\nWould absolutely agree then then the issue is twofold as not only sexual assault is an issue but it's lying to Congress in lying under oath or clearly that would be disqualified\nEven if it's found that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking habits do you think that would be disqualifying as\nWell so that has been a whole new issue that I've been fascinated with that people have said OK if we can ... now that we have him on record for new things I tried to find new things that maybe we we can say not necessarily lying about what we have different interpretations\nAre one people that one person says yes objectively I think you drink too much and he says objectively no I don't think I was drinking too much then that's enough for lying enough to exclude him that's no longer a dialogue about sexual assault that's trying to find some way to trip up a nominee\nTo be able to catch them on something based on some kind of history from thirty six years ago that that that's no longer really drawn to be able to get to a judge that's trying to be able to destroy someone personally I Am offended by that I think most people should be quite frankly many my democratic colleagues\nHave said to me quietly I really hope that they don't reopen my time when I was in high school the way that we're opening up the time on Brett Kavanaugh and he's in high school and try to challenge everything\nYou don't think it's fair to say that it would be disqualifying and Brett Kavanaugh was missed characterizing his drinking habits as a teenager\nSo drinking habits as a teenager and someone saying he drank too much and the other one's saying he didn't drink too much becomes a subjective issue a sexual assault is very clear\nRepublican senator James Lankford of Oklahoma thank you very much for joining us today that go out to be able to share with you\nGeneral Electric stunned much of Wall Street today by firing its chief executive John ... after about a year ... stock price and reputation has steadily declined over the years they fell further under ... watch NPR's Jim Zarroli reports\nFew companies have the kind of storied history that he had with over a century\nWe put it in the good things to live\nIt was one of the original companies and the Dow Jones industrial average it made jet engines dishwashers light bulbs nuclear reactors it's management techniques were studied in business schools she was an incubator for CEOs top executives who went on to had other fortune five hundred companies\nBut University of Michigan business professor Erik Gordon says there were problems under the surface it\nBecame a big bureaucracy ah and it moved slowly in a world that kept moving more quickly\nGordon says much of jeeze profits turned out to be tied to its financial services arm which was badly hurt in the crash of the housing market in the years that followed GE he started to shrink by laying off a lot of employees and selling divisions but it wasn't enough\nThat was the company that John flattery inherited when he became CEO and August of last year flattery spent months trying to convince GE shareholders that he was addressing the company's problems here he was over the summer in an interview on CNBC\nWe've covered the company from Horner to corner a terms of analyzing fall fast which for the company insurance capital power business so I'm very comfortable we've got a handle on what's going on inside the company\nBut the problems only seem to mount especially at the troubled G.
