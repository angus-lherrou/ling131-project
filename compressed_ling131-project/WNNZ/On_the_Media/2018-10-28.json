this network from New England [noise]\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield on election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three\nA yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns to state too it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not a legally protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWithin math class in the mean\nAnd woman can and cannot Wilmington locker room\nDown in the ... you can find [noise]\nIt's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me off but see the activists on the other side it's a question many themselves trans went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trends related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charged age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nMore able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other out groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got out and tore knock it out recycling\nWhat we find when we do a series of follow up surveys three days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had the conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not that treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is it if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and ... them against\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nOh of surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we show them these ads it'd be affected the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effect we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely haven't asked what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy owned a matter of campaign theory\nWe're actually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to buy my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kinda flush out or understanding of this\nTV ad campaigns Rachel lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers you have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complexes built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors\nThen it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success and in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap we might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team\nWhat you need is a candidate or a cause that many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical footing on the subject of an election or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that kind of the trap that the research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years what we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYet but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations\nCome out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think the campaigns will or even necessarily should be taking this one
