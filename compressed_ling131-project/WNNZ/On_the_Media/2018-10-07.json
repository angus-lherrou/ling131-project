never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nWhy you found

effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep around despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point wounded knee was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nVia Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight declared it Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby all for the following treated real purchase ... for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar on about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with the FBI is is that right [noise] they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct ends but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who is one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself and the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank car Luigi\nOf Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get

Ninety two\nExpelled from the garden to wander the earth and shame in poverty right [laughter] but you didn't have that one already south right you've heard that story too you know so often we think of Indian life as lives that are defined by\nHaving everything stolen from us\nIndian lives our lives of loss that's how our lives are most often understood and I think a better narrative is to think of our lives as as full of plenty\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion and ability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so\nIn
