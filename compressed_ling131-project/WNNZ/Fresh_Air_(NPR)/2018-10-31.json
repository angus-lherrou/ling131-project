source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nFor example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nAnd it questions the credibility\nOf the coin because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal in\nSuch areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused herself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll cabin uh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects a\nLeaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true\nPart is and self in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance appeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it you know or their Republican interest where their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact bias\nWe had so much fun last year with doing it again New England public radio second annual jazz baby Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north up and get your glad rags on and get your tickets today at NPR done now\nOf course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of a sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas [noise]\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was ... it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts ... I think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act this 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and tea Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference at the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives called Kavanaugh\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nBefore his nomination which was during the course that nomination why was he called ... that\nOh the they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives want an instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we don't I Will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measure\nScholarly legal opinion saying the cases and quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst him not happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the cabin oh we'll be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional ism his affection for the court and for its own reputation may\nLead him in ... on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively so\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then ... in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David a caplin former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court\nCalled the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution we'll talk more after a break and Ken technical review singer songwriter occurred in ... new album I'm Terry Gross and ...

Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or attacks journalist I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch are Kavanaugh an originalist or attacks journalist or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they were both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing\nAbout the whole original is a a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no cause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and valleys solar local TV design at installation helping household secure state or federal incentives and live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nFollow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights you say that originalism favor as\nA status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions Laurel are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because of the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their Stella credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was chosen by Bill Clinton and so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford\nIn the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time around or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together and they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court\nPack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nTo Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals that an eleven member court you have a six five majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now eighty five and how it was a John Paul Stevens when he left\nNinety yeah so ... you can say for a really\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nGig [laughter] yeah [laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\n'em in the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make current justices leave\nIt would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be um nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court is a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "31"}
