experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercising just you know you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same our production designer Nathan Crowley

so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window UC space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are going to be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be revealed is shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledgeable the rail and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight still uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a dictionary and patient and\nAnd just physical jostling um all of that\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to kneel and and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we uh Ryan I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody fair lap and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because ah he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast year when did we ain't getting ... from we we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hang banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not client\nAt all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and said can you talk a little bit about the sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nWell I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little groans and bones of of of the

moon flight\nMasha put together a ... meant about the ... of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping they landed on the moon but if they don't get they don't match is preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean

see a a given Heinz who plays ... is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find online and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a wading caps elites in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nA live their lives in and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations

really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world a boycott and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think it was\nA pretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much be motions that something like that or get aroused think ah obviously the moon landing was an American achievement and an incredible one\nAnd the flag on the moon was a very important part of that which is why we we show it we show it several times so to flex standing there

into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag\nA we made a choice entirely ... choice not a political one to focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about ... minutes from the litter surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous wine or his ... sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from many cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk but no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this um\nThose are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase who not only the American flag on

I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis was music he plays on the way to the moon or things that you refer and yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's it's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody\nYup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect inhale Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices that Sarah man is incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having\nKind of transcendent experience of like being on your way to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so how did it strike you know\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually within the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that ah that Neal and some of the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from divorced shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch controls certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying first to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay

first man which has directed by ... who also directed land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on a land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years in ... kinda languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and a ... by the way I also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical staff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real sad and then miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know a lot of land with a complex film but that's because of like the choreography in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like that can be difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know is it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history a and I think particularly knowing\nThat a A N ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right or but knowing that at the end of the day this was a film but they were a going to see
