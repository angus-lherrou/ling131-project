money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven make that decision\n[noise]\nSo the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meetings after Trump died they would hand out check you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to develop for in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... own at that time of his death I'll get it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to their children\nThey included both buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York development ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through\nThat that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that down and Donald Trump me it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from a few million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that Autor but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you are the most expensive legal and accounting hoping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and\nThey might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um since then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public I'm thinking which one to choose\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they pass university graduate schools and asked and applied laboratories outside operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\n[noise] oh well so if you publishers are coming back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and Wylie lingo shaving your skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this both so happens to coincide with the time when you're actually took possession\nOf one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money might\nNot happen in two thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the Mets have how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward\nIn that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... dot\nI think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents hop I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's hard for a few because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times that was basically sealed off to everybody except that the three report is working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access and you were locked up
