the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father help Russian Jewish immigrants in the U.S and tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob\nAnd it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit to the store and I'd sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt a extraordinary or special to be Jewish\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un day path university graduate schools and I say in creative non fiction writing enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay pest dot edu\nAnd um she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were shipped 'em we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that says happy Halloween because it's missing an end\nSo we have the the misfit toys or moderate go um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect me between being told about anti Semitism and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh\nThe Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments so floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew or the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nNow because there's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes sometimes you know I I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't and\nNobody was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants don't fit inappropriate and and I remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this is\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you in the western

this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was an outrageous action to to take 'em you know or just\nA shelling out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny joke I Would just say it's a you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I thought I have I Want to say those things so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other\nA mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas\nAnd it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was to me like a safe space for you or you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that\nIs that like there's so many pop culture references and bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and they happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them said made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in feel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer\nAnd having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down\nAnd say oh I'm going to hold on to this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of the funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment\nI'll I'll get paid for by putting it in the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running bow jak witches Netflix series now the comedy central there's rain yet starting with season one um what's that like for you because you and ... like some of the jokes in season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter]\nCable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks down and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "17"}
