she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's\nButter and this isn't like a rational this is a kind of upsets buttering person\nThen this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level\nI get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed\nBut I Know what Catherine character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your or to pursue
