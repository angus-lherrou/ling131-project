focuses on the story of Derek Black\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\n... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nGarrett black as we known as white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull a trigger the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find done black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and gone to work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter I'm not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters potty yet attached to a fourteen idiots to white nationalist slogans fourteen refers to a a fourteen word\nSort of statement a purpose that is central to what storm frog does about um securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know and saying things like I'm here because of the white genocide and I can't stand by and and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the the language in the motivation that exist on store front and that's\nGap is pretty small and and the social media space I mean it I think it's about a half million users and but uh it really embraces this\nSort of radical idea of free speech above all else them so somebody like Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist who does not have a platform on Twitter and because Twitter doesn't doesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gab Richard Spencer the white national I spent a lot of time there have\nThere is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gas\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un that university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at ... dot edu\nInjure of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThe hours when he went on gab he saw the message is only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's\nThe message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue\nUm instilling front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo so what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happens ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and\nAnd the reaction is mostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody's going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done are guaranteed black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways culpable and he wanders and you know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into you know incidents like this and there was central to creating the phrase white genocide and said to popular I think that in the movement said to have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young life is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Darren black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white

Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included sass no the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning like people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like yeah but in particular I ever turn white nationalism in into that with his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was as far as it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nEssentially everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo that they don't like the word race is I think that's a made up insult toward they lay\nTheir clients to word [noise] um\nRatio last racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power to white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more\nPernicious I think that the thing that complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy is that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist in many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talked about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter

violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide\nAgainst you still it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and who are in fact in the in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and that quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nBy being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants who are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme that it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and the western mass coaching

percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that um your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time to find him because\nHe was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this issue how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with regard to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to a stone who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview

of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found that he really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to eat\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nJewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you that made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think it was very very smart of it\nOr not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people in having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nOr that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nAddition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and ... and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then they're also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited to Derrick over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them and he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself can be transformative and I think\nIt's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWould sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the
