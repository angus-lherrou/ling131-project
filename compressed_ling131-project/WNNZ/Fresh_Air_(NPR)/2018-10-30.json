um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow\nThings in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain enjoy\nOf life [noise] why\nDon't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you\nStart the scene\nMakes such a gun on\nI think we live in a

holiday party Saturday December first of the hotel north helping your blood red zone or get your tickets today at NPR are done minutes\n[noise] was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things\nAnd you still find humanity in there and I like how\nUnabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do in your new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of you as a parable father ... father [laughter]

Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nHad of any hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate nprmontagne over the place in Syria and Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe not want to let me one of the [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] but I was shot and in light of the name check you on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR it's incredibly boring to a kid even though he so aware to talk about the show with such detail\nAnd understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first time this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader told a story about a go into a Benny haunt in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style and I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if you will like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell Jonah Hill thank you so much for coming on the show it's been great to talk with you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air
