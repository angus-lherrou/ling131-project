voters\nSince plenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which you lose people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough in Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters\nAccording to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and

have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented a new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states and the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote or to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls\nAnd many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia\nFrom its voting rolls one point five million people have been purged from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen so there's a lot of different data points that show how Georgia is leading the way when it comes to restricting access to the ballot\nOkay there's other states with voting issues to talk about but first we're going to take a short break\nIf you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones we'll talk more about voting

fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nWho is talking about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things\nHe wrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or a birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans oh almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state the federal court actually struck that law down\nEarlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voter so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tough since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turnout could shift the race and co box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally in twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security and ... had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purport to show that three million people\nWe're so much fun last year we're doing it again New England public radio second annual gyms be be Nineteen twenties holiday party Saturday December refers to the hotel north open you're glad rigs zone and get your ticket today in the urine done\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\n... own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures its use to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has\nSo the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents is that\nSteve Bannon at the time the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here Terry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation in an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nThat the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether it documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the census and the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise wouldn't affair and accurate census\nToo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuit is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire census and so if the census is unfair if the census is inaccurate and so many things the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and valleys solar local TV design at installation helping household secure state or federal incentives and live carbon free and the four one three valleys solar dot solar\nThey respond to cases pertaining

thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise location [noise] matinees EM dot com slash NPR [noise]\nAnd from capital ones committed to reimagining banking\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Terry twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiative that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration\nThere are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting in places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ballot initiative the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons can't vote that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people\nIn the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas than others\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nCan sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he is implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\n[noise] so\nIn the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what's his position on voting rights he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record\nOn voting rights heat up out of voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but Calvin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the twenty Eighteen election right now\nLike chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nAmazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nFact that there are so many new barriers to voting both in states that were covered by the voting rights act to places like Texas and Georgia orange states that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fried how pervasive hazard than\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I Want it to commit voter fraud in New York in a state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I Would have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it if you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting\nA very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevent it from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud were saying\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us
