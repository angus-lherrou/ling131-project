government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service as part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the Energy Department many responsibilities\nMany essential positions in the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseen well others have conflicts of interest that political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this and articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is just the risk that you failed to imagine it is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under ... focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it defense rest now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice she's very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with technology\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the

guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise] you\nKnow I'm an English so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid to what's happening on the cabinet level on that department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the big decided we'd ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having added and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving story and it's to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is\nThe go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another a cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been fraught this very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the fifth risk the Commerce Department includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing and the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I didn't know what each the Commerce Department and the national weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no ... and how do they get their back in the seventies\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for October twenty second applications at bay past dot edu\nThere doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIt's the ... the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah adopt the radar the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the day to the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he has been trying to do is Oregon ... essentially a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYou know you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons all the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at all the energy solar helping homes

basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who to prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office\nAnd listen politely and didn't take notes and the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nYou

sixteen Bayh road open six days a week through Thanksgiving small ones farm dot com\nAnd risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pocket because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sense it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that ... there's a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approach the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River in poisons the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking it lots of you know one and a million or ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of intimacy showed you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse if he's asked an eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm doing what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world market [noise] well I'm a big question\nThe question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nYou know it's not my job but you know if I ...
