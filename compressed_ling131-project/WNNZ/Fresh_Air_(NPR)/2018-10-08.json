[laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought\nAbout songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that time writing was a craft that something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a farce looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older\nThat was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] and you grow older and then you then you sort of see how remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he was scrapped\nYour record that's an amateur move said amateur move he says yeah it's not about how\nYou feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um the love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that\nHe had been given\nBy the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise]\nHow old were you and your parents separated um five six and I'm not the don't remember so how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been

liquid he called is like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived\nIn the long dirt road and he bought one

after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow long did that for\nWell he did that and variations of that through my own entire life and and\nAs I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happened to you and then in its own way as may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people [noise] um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing is so low to sell the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um and incredible that [laughter]\nThat do the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from
