nothing quite like it in the history of American business uh it is now to point two billion monthly active users meaning it's larger than any country in the world it's really got no I'm no natural

their farms down small ones farm dot com\nElections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors they'll give us an example [noise]\nThis is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and very often don't say much about it starting last year\nSean Parker who is Facebook's first president he's sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that\nAs he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth a vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our mind we all had a sense that something might be going wrong with our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call external and I think somewhat internally\nYes side effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions and in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decrease sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they are trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is on the ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it you hurt for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glaze dies hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you and so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively\nCommunicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key difference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore\nYou know you talk to ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that as he regard this kind of experimentation\nHe absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he has an and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do it he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise]\nUm too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a a took to get out into the world I'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept it they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being less private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they have to go to ... graduate schools an asset applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay path dot edu\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary members of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm he\nDid and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel the same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nAnd people said that's ... that's wild that's not right privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really embedded in the bill of rights and\nUm his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people further there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be aggressively transparent in order 'em\nTo be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private cells in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed that being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their\nTheir ... their motto of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world that\nAlmost like redefining what it is to be human and [noise]\nYeah they believed that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach at Facebook where fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other cases like Cambridge Analytica was that this was outright fast this was a case of hackers were hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding [noise] essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts or Facebook also I'm to be safe or took another forty million users and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control of\nThe accounts so are there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could post things on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers doing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know\nWhy they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied the history faced what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they would have they would have\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach I'm really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as its answered at this point\nListening to the ... recorded with ... ... a staff writer for the New Yorker I was in office\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass

some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency in Russia um\nHow did soccer bird respond to this\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might have affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nPreparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million Facebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation\nAnd what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project\nAnd yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had this dispositive effect\nOn our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged that from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's why I'm so ... who was in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there was a lot riding on that appearance or you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\n... he in some ways vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or an ... senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads that it was such an obvious fact anybody use paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this\nIt's become this consuming effort you know Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaking one initiative after another so when it comes to political life\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed the university graduate schools and ask and applied laboratory science at operations enrolling now for August twenty seventh applications at bay paths dot edu\n... that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads now we are going to not only do that but we're going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users be able to click on an ad and then no not only who paid for it but what other ads to those people pay for and and who were they targeting\nUm they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shape elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in in many ways Dave it's almost like they have a gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after\nThe midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working um and I think what's interesting is so Facebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation at all and now to say we took down a group of\nRussian uh imposter who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions about what what the public season would have doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices or take for example the you know misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers public\nThose kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in conference rooms at Facebook and it's very complicated\n[noise] Evan us most is a staff
