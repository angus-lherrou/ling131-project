press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is your discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly though [noise]\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well let me\nKnow is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as a day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services and we'll be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime\nWell it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities\nSay the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin and he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful tax\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um well it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the ... one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on like an eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um\nStreaming of New England public radio was wounded boy you all energy solar helping homes businesses are firms in western New England save money via environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nAnd and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRate um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were a vigil last night there always are there will be at another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\n[noise] yeah well I think mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n[noise]\nYeah ... incredibly moving and somber what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that's the sentences but unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out um [noise]\nUh of course you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you and other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com see people\nI'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well I think\nAny situation than it and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nAnd people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is there's a search for why after that it's a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motive for crimes that they can prosecute investigate and said that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but um it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a third parties in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING [noise]\nAnd then the other to have a little bit more that that needs to be done and can't say enough for the the medical staff at the hospitals for what they're doing for the officers ... we had a lot cheaper ... to try\nAnd uh they're they're doing a fantastic job ah with that I Can't say enough for the interagency interagency support\nA western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nUh and yesterday just showed how that works city county state federal agencies working together no egos working together for what's

diversity of the community the Jewish community is the backbone is part of the fabric of Pittsburgh\nAnd we will be there in all communities to support our friends in the Jewish community\nWe um [noise] as I said it had been knocked down before but we've always been able to stand back up because we worked together and I have to take a moment to think those that spoke earlier\nThe effort that was put in across multi jurisdictions from the federal to the state to the county to the local\nWas something that we should all be proud of\nThe fact that we were able to work together as one community suburban medics coming in voluntarily to take on different areas of our city because all of our medics were after scene or medics\nDeciding on their day off to voluntarily come in to fill seven additional ambulances to back up our officers and the officers who came from surrounding counties the federal agents in this state troopers and the county officers all working together\nIn order to be able to make sure an episode\nThat will forever go down in the history of this city\nIs one of the worst moments that we have experienced was able to be less and because of that coordination into those that are standing behind me who spoke early earlier the professionalism that was exemplified through their leadership\nWas something that we needed our darkest time [noise] to our officers who are in the hospital into one officer who's been discharged the thanks for the entire city go to them\nThey're sacrificing their knowing of the danger that they put themselves in in order to be able to protect others there's something when they put on that uniformed that we should understand\nThe sacrifice that they make to their family members the city will be behind in there to support you in anything that you may need\nAnd finally to those that are not familiar with Pittsburgh to those who have given a their words of not only confidence but support to Pittsburgh from around the world around this nation and around the state\nThank you we know\nWe as a society are better than this\nWe know that hatred will never went out\nThat those that tried to divide us because of the way that we pray or where our families are from around the world will lose in in Pittsburgh we're pragmatic\nAnd we find solutions to problems we will not try to rationalize the rational behavior we will not try to figure out ways in order to lessen the degree of crimes such as this we will work to eradicate it we will work to eradicate it from our city\nFrom our nation in our world\nHatred will not have a place anywhere\nAnd we won't work locally to make those changes happen and we'll work with partners around this country and around the world to make sure that it ants\nStreaming of New England public

yesterday at the tree of life synagogue and we're joined now by Sarah McCammon again who is in Pittsburgh Sarah Oh we heard the names of those who were killed and and what else\nSome people might be reminded of how they felt after the Parkland shootings may be that would have an effect\nI'm One of the effects that I think this will have as the pipe bomb story had is that it makes it harder for the president to control the narrative because we're not talking about cabinet and the caravan as much as we're talking about the pipe bomber\nAnd the synagogue shooter and he has actually complained about that he said that\nHe'd been looking at and momentum and now this bomb thing happened and that's all the media is talking about Steve and listening to special coverage from NPR News

past week also saw fourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nAnd that has been arrested in that case she's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning the all right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect they opt to go before a federal magistrate on Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help\nAre we getting a picture of how he became this extreme\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen you had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media wants thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland the community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks against David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and ensure oath in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you spent with coworkers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nSatellites that left me last Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nAnd That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre me thank you so much thank you living\nLast few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by ... Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about ...\nStreaming of New England public radio is ... Franklin Community co op offering organic produce ... groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and that voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have to eat it frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue or that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Westfield", "day": "28"}
