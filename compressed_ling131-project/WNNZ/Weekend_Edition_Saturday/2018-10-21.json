bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nThat's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and she'll be with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nClimbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many events issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and the un Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east than American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very calculated in terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy and the region\nBut they've been able to play this role of of basically defending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important important important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange they need to invest in it they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided\nBy Europe it can't be provided by other allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario

Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version the Mexican government said that the army and the fact that I Believe they didn't know anything about what the what is happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends these used official start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official ... is our ally is not true it's a lie so\nTell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean

all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students are on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group of students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were targeting inside bus that's why they did was just too\nAnd so these two versus what exactly they are two bosses that the army and they said that police start to ...\nSee Steve ... before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is what the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by us all energy solar helping homes businesses and firms in western New England save money and the environment with solar power all energy solar dot com\nState legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said that just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that are really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads are the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse what Republicans the hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate\nWhich is tied actually the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie\nAnd the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that didn't as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave changed a lot of ah Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though on other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night
