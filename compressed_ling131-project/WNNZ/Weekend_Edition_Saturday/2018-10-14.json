governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats\nAnd that's incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and\nThey want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month with the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida's always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's gonna be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss up but the Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican those were some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs as playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republican and how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip the seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nIce has been a rallying cry for some on the left the coal gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress and yet progressive

is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data up to twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute said that they more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more after me take like right now and ... and an overhead wire\nBack to Mars hasn't flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of an independent micro grids with solar power and batteries that places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we ought to be finished and restraint chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure of a population it keep the lights and even if the project\nMcNamara was lead author of a twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change\nThat a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries Jeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit

political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us thanks for having me\nAll right so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago he's seen a lotta storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction caused\nBy thing Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast and I remember the city of Cleveland in Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd and all of the associated\nDestructive ... that kind of turns a once kind of lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of you know any sign of or many signs of human habitation and construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise about eight percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally Rick Scott was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over well both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it appears so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor but it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a ...\nTallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power last\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the census for his leadership during a storm hurricane her mean\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly\nIn in one case actually changed showing trees away\n[laughter] and I'm moving debris really so he's changed on your trees [laughter] well he's he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone is trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen a what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle is going to be almost impossible poll right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating her son of the people\nThat the political as my computer joining us from Florida this

time to convince the football coach to give her a shot\nA hit list and I'm going into senior year in China this year I don't have you ever put me on the field and land the football team and just kind

about what she was doing she was very very meticulous in terms of the practice plan I asked her and she was very confident\nStevens is also the head coach at Dartmouth College he invited brown since
