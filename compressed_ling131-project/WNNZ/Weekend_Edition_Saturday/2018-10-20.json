like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a bump pale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi or explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and ... we're trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the\nBrits and the French who do supply weapons as well to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to a\nPoint of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world will be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens\nIs one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAnd we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to express outrage they're very practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country\nWe had so much fun last

of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination but that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes a hired this company to kill this local political leader the\nLA and Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you use your guest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was a reservist and he was a seal reservist he he

allowed to a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or\nThe Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that

but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly

didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that not even one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about Matty with her son in her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't

I mean there last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that\nThis is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series in Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know the the course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and if they say wait exactly yes and a Christian tell her debuted as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also show playing in the NBA for their mistakes Mickey Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when I ... I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better run on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know gifts [laughter]\nNo and in in that sport it's a big deal in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm in Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA

twelve then they're going to go to a ... break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the fifth ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break serve
