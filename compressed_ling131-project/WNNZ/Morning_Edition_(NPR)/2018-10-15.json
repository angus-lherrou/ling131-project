Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives in Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed eight twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump Andy is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is\nMade it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lump sum show them I'm Michelle filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCountries so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're probably your global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger the sailors more than half their market maybe over ...\nThe store to store but yet they I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with it well\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and all the energy solar helping homes businesses and farms in western New England save money and the environment with

through a short term problem but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nAnd well we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests were taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer in and hopefully you know have people you've converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid we obviously this is the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nUh [noise] I think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue do you mean an issue like election\nYeah it has to come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means you can Jackie or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah\nIn in he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell you better making jak\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been ... yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and from my standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back\nTo drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generations Barrett\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margin they will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says that by the former communications director for the RMC\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you other western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nGoals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blamed Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overarching goal\nAnd if they managed to hang onto power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrower majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nAnd you're listening to New England public radio coming up on the marketplace morning report Harvard University faces a lawsuit going to trial day concerning admissions practices the case may reveal details about\nHow universities craft their student body that story plus the latest business news in ten minutes\nAs MORNING EDITION continues on New England public radio funded by you and do you ...

there are things that can predispose people to complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy\nIt can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy you're going in\nAnd that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody it doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but el the family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the

Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world for resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show though I'm Michelle filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with\nHow global business is this\nMore and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're probably global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I I Would say they're international sales were starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with a well a ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas in kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that up what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nAh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs you consumer and and hopefully you know have people who have converted

there are no winners or trade war and we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage to you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue\nDo you mean an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean Congress and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he's you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will know for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah\nIn in he told us he understood exactly did this with the district mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks design tens of federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon being indigenous spirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker there's that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking from a fight standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before\nYou know we might lose

exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November
