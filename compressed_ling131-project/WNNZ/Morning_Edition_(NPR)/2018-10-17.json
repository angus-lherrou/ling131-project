protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ... she had thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which in a slum in Liberia's capital\nStories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a smells that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she started this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along but grown in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in too\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community owns since Nineteen Seventy seven\nThe country and she started up a charity first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\n[noise] I never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls said he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ...\nAnd he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power according to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lawyer had an intimate relationship with him but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to all reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points to organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse with an institution in any other context\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and they passed university graduate schools MS and applied data science enrolling for

you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local the local donor community I think I'm On the local community you have the sense of\nA lot of people that are feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credit than these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was fold and the

a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nLiberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water street when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong

or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the ... level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually but taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along but growing in doing various forms of\nGift community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship and then from there to continue the relationship with the country and she started the project to first registered in two thousand and\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow in ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start disorganization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him [noise]\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who was fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you land a western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nOr a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked when he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in their equipment the girls said he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what it told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that the he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to this story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that every revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports and to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now is important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you
