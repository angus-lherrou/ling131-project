R. dot net\nThe judge would be shocked um so I think um you know there was a way for him to make his case and in fact I think Dr\nChristine Blasey Ford made her case in a way that was passionate but not overly emotional and that somebody who was talking about how she had been sexually assaulted so\nSo here are Kavanaugh gets on to the Supreme Court what would you want to happen in cases involving Democrats whether you have to be refusing himself all the time and could somebody make him\nA ... no one can make him which is a real concern um there's nothing that forces Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves of course parties would file a motion to recuse where they feel like it's appropriate\nI think if you have an issue that concerns women um or liberal politics or even voting cases I think there's a real concern as to whether he can be fair\nIssues concerning women you're saying that you would be making an argument or if you were a lawyer before the court that he shouldn't be judging anything concerning women\nI mean I ... I don't know that I Would make that argument that far better than I was like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court involving him right\nDo I think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society thanks so much thank\nYou a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who want to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele tell them in a State Department\nOfficial says marriage equality is the low the land here in the U.
