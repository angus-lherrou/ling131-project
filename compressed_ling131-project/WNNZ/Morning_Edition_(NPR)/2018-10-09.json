top close the lid [noise]\nHit a button and in a few seconds you've got a warm cup of coffee or [noise] this\nCompany started out as a small coffee roaster in Vermont but about ten years ago its products got really popular and that meant big profits and major growth\nSo how did that happen a lot of factors including money from the state of Vermont designed to create jobs most of it came from a program called veggie and I'm not talking about carrots and broccoli ... stands for Vermont employment growth incentive\nHere's a veggie is supposed to work the state promises to pay back a company like ... after it can prove that it created jobs or made investments cure it has been approved for the most money of all companies that have become eligible for the payments\nBut exactly how much they received and what they did with it I wanted to find out [noise] so I called Casey mock kissing\nThis was in March of this year at the time of mock was the head of the Vermont economic progress council the board that called the shots read decides who gets the money for the veggie program\nTo have that information and by connection that jobs associated with that information publicly available would present a problem\nMock quickly told me that there is a state law that prevents him from telling me how much money the state gave to cure ache or what they did with it the reason he says to protect a company's proprietary information like a prospective contract or product\nMocks advice for finding out how many taxpayer dollars the state paid Curie asked cure egg\nAnd of course like whatever jury\nTells you that they're happy to the school was um you know it's not like we're going to stop\nThat sure either a sure so I reached out to cure egg I asked them for documentation of the actual payments they receive from the state\nEnd of the number and types of jobs created with that money no immediate response and then in April nearly three weeks later Casey mock with the state calls to tell me the company will be in touch\nYou will be hearing from them and they'll give you a statement\nStatement the company sent over claimed the program made it possible for curing to quote maintain a strong physical presence in Vermont and create over two thousand jobs and spend over four hundred and fifty million dollars with this\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co-op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in Greenfield an Schober involves community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nIt also does not say anything about exactly how much money the company has received from the state uh curing spokes person would not provide me with an interview or a tour of their headquarters in Waterbury\nBusinesses are used to keeping their information private but taxpayer dollars are usually subject to public scrutiny this lack of transparency bothers state auditor dunk offer offer things at least the number of jobs created by these awards should be public\nI think the people who said I have a right to know I don't think employment data would would compromise the integrity of from\nEven though it's not out in the open there is a cost benefit analysis built into the veggie program when a company comes to the state with a proposal and before the state gives out a veggie award they run that proposal through a model to figure out how much the state would benefit Casey mock showed me a redacted version of the system\nAnd so I brought a copy of what will discuss uh for you for\nThe model ways things like how much new employees will spend on lunch as well as you know wear and tear on the roads that kinda stuff\nStill we can't see how all this played out for curing as far as the actual payments from the state to carry the Commerce Department considers those to be tax returns so they too are confidential\nMeeting minutes from the board that oversees veggie are public during one meeting in two thousand seven the company which was known as green mountain coffee roasters at the time told the board it might expand outside Vermont and he called the public funds critical just staying here\nI'd hope that meeting minutes would reveal how much money was spent in on what but every time the board actually discussed whether to approve curing for a veggie award that appears to have happened in executive session meaning there's no public notes of what was said\nThe next question is what is the state's gotten for all of this it's supposed to create jobs and therefore money for the state but well curing it clearly grew in Vermont not all those jobs stuck around\nWaterbury based cure a green mountains says it will cut approximately two hundred jobs in Vermont\nSince twenty Fifteen curing has laid off at least four hundred and fifty five workers in Vermont including thirty five as recently as may I figured at the very least I could compare the number of people curious has employed over time to try to track the impact of the state funds that way\nBut Dirk Anderson the general counsel for the state's Labor Department says even that's not possible\nThat information is considered confidential\nOver this past winter curing announced they're merging with Dr Pepper and in June the states stopped paying out installments of one of the company's veggie awards because the company's workforce dropped so significantly according to a state report\nBut curing Dr Pepper is apparently not done using the veggie program last year a company called Bedford systems applied for a one point
