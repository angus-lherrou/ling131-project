and today also marks another day closer to actual recreational marijuana sales but that is still the plan right and actually going to say the state fiscal year we're now three months behind in revenue from we'd sales right\n[noise] that's that is exactly right and thankfully I think\nYou're not just being metaphorical there we are actually one day closer and\nIt is highly likely this week that we think that the cameras control commission will probably issue some final licenses for retail pot shops open after they've been doing some of the final inspection work needed at some of the businesses that were pretty much ready to go so we could be almost there I Would say\nTo do you get the sense in covering those meetings that any state marijuana regulators you're actually feeling that mounting pressure to really actually get the product on to store shelves as you know nearby states who also have pretty full huge tourist attractions\nCould actually muscle Massachusetts out of a weed tourist destination industry\nYeah I mean they are and they aren't I think there are certainly aware of the outside pressure they're aware of anticipation and the\nDesire to not look like they're slow walking or doing this in any way given the political ramifications of that but they also want to make sure that they get this right because the worst thing to do the roll this out and have something go horribly wrong\nYou mentioned that there was some money in the budget I think it was maybe just north of sixty million that they were counting on in revenue from sales to balance the budget from cannabis marijuana products so falling behind they don't want to fall too far behind them so that could probably be made up depending on how fast these stores open but that is also a consideration\nLast week the chair of the gaming commission step down Steven Crosby said he didn't want to be a distraction for the commission as they are preparing to weigh the results of an investigation into when resorts\nWhich holds the Boston area casino license so when do we expect governor Baker to pick a new permanent chair for the commission\nYeah I'm not sure that we've heard the full story of this yet I mean it was very interesting kind of a surprise that Germany Crosby would step down he of course has been in charge since expanded came and got off the ground in Massachusetts he was\nBeing accused of being biased on both sides of the issue when it comes to reviewing it's a win license and he chose to remove himself I mean we also know that he had some interest in being the new chancellor of UMass Boston he wasn't that he didn't have an eye on a possible exit from the gaming commission at some point so\nMaybe he just felt this was a good time to step aside the administration now has to consider what direction they want to go for who's going to chair there's potentially for a good long time\nStreaming of New England public radio was founded by you in the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nDeconstructing that whole wing casino if they pull the license and figuring out what to do with the property and what to do in eastern Massachusetts so either way it will be\nA huge job the governor had suggested in a statement just prior to Crosby is decision being announced that he should consider recusing himself so I think maybe\nThey were beginning to think about this but it does not seem from our conversations with the administration that they were really prepared for Steve Crosby to step away fully from this so anticipate that it'll probably take some time for them to that some candidates for the new chairman role and and install someone\nThat commission has been largely deferential to the casino industry as we saw and all the accolades that they showered on MGM Springfield is he your expectation that a new commissioner would sit that mold or is someone gonna be brought in to stir things up\n[noise] yeah I'm not sure I mean I think they'll probably have to take into consideration the fact that when this commission was named in the first place and keep in mind that the law does stipulate some qualifications these commissioners must have\nThere has to be some law enforcement background some accounting background but every commissioner has the same\nResume but they have to fit into the sort of boxes so they're also going to be looking for someone to do the startup phase of the casino work since that has already been done and the procedures in place and the commission has established an up and running with its policies\nBut someone to oversee the growth and expansion of casinos and making sure that they run properly so someone\nWith the management experience and someone maybe with a million of of of how these things run once they're\nBuilt in the construction phase is over so I think all of that could come into play\nMat Murphy reporter and associate editor with this the town's news service and Boston Thanks so much for joining us Matt ...\nThis is the can heal inside any PR weekly check
