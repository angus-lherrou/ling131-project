Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty Twenty one is the problem that you're trying to address what\nWe're trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the

about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think votes through protests um I I must say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them lawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes\nUm you know I I'd be going after them I'm
