EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say he has to visit rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her for historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful an enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to first and only go so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nCan't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods in

as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest talking about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the end if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's structured and accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years

stock\nOr doesn't get all the kernels to separate from the cop the left behind stocks remain there on purpose to indicate to farmers how much corn in each field doesn't make it to market it's all

Still drawn to the term those lonely stops are like magnets and I know I'll keep holding over just stare at them\nI think the idea of gathering loss haunt me so because the phrase points to thoughts

Geoff Diehl clashed last night over deal support for the president and warned interest and replacing him more now from double the viewers Anthony Brooks\nMorning deal wasted no time in last night's debate using their opening statements to launch would've become familiar lines of attack here's deal going after Warren for her possible plan to run for president which he says will make her a part time senator\nElizabeth Warren desperately wants you to believe that her focus is on Massachusetts but the fact that she doesn't care about your house she cares about the White House\nAnd here's Warren attacking deal as the guy who's promised to have Donald Trump's back in Washington he's also embrace to tax plan that his Republican colleagues say they're going to pay for by cutting Social Security and Mr deal says he wants to be with Donald Trump a hundred percent of the time\nDeal co chaired Trump's campaign and Massachusetts but argues that unlike the president he has a record of working with Democrats but at the WCBS debate last night there was no agreement between the Republican challenger and the Democratic incumbent starting with the first question\nDoes President Trump's divisive rhetoric help incite violence including the recent attempted mail bomb attacks and the shooting massacre the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nDeal blamed pockets of deep seated hatred and didn't mention the president but he did criticize war and for some of her heated rhetoric\nFor example a year ago health care was being debated by saying that Republicans want and this is a quote blood money from the American people at a time when Congress ... had been shot by us Bernie Sanders supporter that's the kind of rhetoric in dialogue that pushes people in the wrong way\nFor her part Moran placed at least part of the blame for the breakdown of the nation civil discourse on President Trump\nUltimately the responsibility for the person who commits the violent lies with the person who committed the violence that Donald Trump is not making things better when he does a tax on the free press when he tries to turn people against people Warren\nAnd deal clashed on a number of issues including taxes and presented to radically different views of government and how it's working or not working for war and it's bad news Republican tax cuts benefit billionaires in corporations at the expense of working people\nWe live in America for opportunities for the middle class are shrinking their growing only that that is the top and that that's what I fight back at ...\nIn Warren's view the economic glass as half empty and because of President Trump but the Republicans it's continuing to drain by contrast deals sees the glass half full and filling up thanks to Republican policies including their trillion and a half dollar tax cuts which he says is helping Massachusetts\nThe fact that matters more people in Massachusetts are making money they are having wage increases and that

believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered I guess I feel I feel

understand the motive\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are malevolent out to control the world Jeffrey her for his story at at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a personal you know so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism it seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that\nThe Jews run the world purpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nThe smartest [noise] you know what do they how they talk about\nThe elite you ever see the elite\nHer says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semite\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and the western mass coaching alliance offering personal and professional growth through its member coaches coaches profiles available at western mass coaches dot com\nIs careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is\nTo bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred of is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of an anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays for member station WBHM easy in Chicago Suzie on reports\nAt a pop up Halloween store in downtown Chicago shoppers are trying on math and sword fighting with ...\nI used to be a lens after the first few weeks around Halloween Chicago costume company is bringing the shop back when the dead Halloween shopping is big business it's expected to generate nine\nBillion dollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nWhen people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know what it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords ... short term leases that Steve shorts with commercial real estate service Jay allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit and um it really allows a landlord to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're
