reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of

Andrea\nIsraeli on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe this I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime is as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms with them and it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody

up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means they're few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this\nStreaming of New England public radio was funded by you at ... university graduate schools MS

forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area\nWell in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally\nFor

sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move the side to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government um and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nWhile I feel like you and I have talked um countless times of America on some of the challenges and calling her times embattled I mean she and her government has been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany and large numbers back in\nTwenty Fifteen right so what do you why is why we arrived at this moment now what's different well there's been a steady\nChipping away at her support uh basically on a national level but also in regional elections this is really dogged her and her party and her allies ah especially ah the the most recent ones we can talk about where last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and ...\nWhich is where Frankfurt is the big financial center and also two weeks the form of area some serious losses where in last night's or or the count basically her party barely is hanging on to power with the coalition of greens\nAre and in Bavaria they I mean it's it's also really shaken up the the the very end allies of of Mrs Malcolm which are uh the the Christian social union members have been very in a ... conservatives if you will\nSo I mean she's been so central to European politics it's hard to imagine European politics without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this decision\nWell the ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the bugs that situation does negotiate in that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until uh until then but it and she's a lame duck at this point\nAnd any talk of who are likely successor might be\nWell even though she hasn't really said who she wants on what what political insiders have told various media a is a hurt the city you general secretary unemployed come ... she's fifty six year old", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Westfield", "day": "29"}
