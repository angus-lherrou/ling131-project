S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these tariffs that President Trump has imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy in my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by you and Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield an Schober and falls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future but it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.

cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution\nThat things that sticks climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute the call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually
