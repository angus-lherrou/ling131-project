midterm elections in our nation's history\nAnd a lot of that money will be spent on TV and radio commercials well that won't happen here in New England Public radio we will receive any of that money or play any part in those commercials because we don't sell political advertising\nInteresting contrast to the fact that the company also this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars and ... and so for the contract workers that Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot I'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand is\nOn it well I mean I I noticed that you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of ... very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers and is this change the result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear it you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um this specific it's usually specific warehouse in specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about though the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with a if you're counting all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this base does a CEO Jeff Bass us came to speak in Washington\nStreaming of New England public radio is funded by the un Franklin Community co op offering organic produce baked goods groceries and prepared foods and Greenfield on children's walls community grown and community own since Nineteen Seventy seven\nDescribe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical kind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man in history who's running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money um\nAnd they had a little science talking specifically about that I'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become a few months recently right I mean the larger business contacts for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment so they're feeling like they can afford this change\nIt I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know you can get companies to big um they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking\nTruck fleet of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of um you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anywhere should be scrutinized\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail on and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nI mean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big us being in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working again congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage which could be huge if you have one of the\nMost valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge\nIt's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the state have been moving toward this\nTarget as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um this is perfectly time for that that\nCreates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of people who might be looking for employment right during the holiday season\nAll
