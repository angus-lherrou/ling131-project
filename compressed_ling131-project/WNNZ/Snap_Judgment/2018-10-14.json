and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie county's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like the triumphant moment and they like having among the shoulder and they're like ... like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars\nAnd the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their causes that we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they ... they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad\nGuy he liked to insult president for life\nAnd [noise] they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a

were all going to go to this other place and then his boss is going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then when we're all going to go home\nThe captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember that than myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just trying to wait it out\nJason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands\nAnd the idea of killing somebody and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors\nAs evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murder somebody I very much a\nThem as victims of circumstance in some ways especially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in his name in you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing his goals are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker raw and um\nYeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody and others\nMm\nThey marched onto

you get home and where you're going to go to buy the\nSupplies and then you imagine eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we took gases and it turns out it and then five minutes\nAnd I think that's probably one Tommy change completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I\nMean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time\nBut they just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plants with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd people seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys Base Camp and now\nI'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain\nAlong with only one of his men as gardening and that one guard was to\nHe kind of a weird way of where we would take to safely up this mountain\nWhere there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet it [noise]\nAnd then we were all going to go together somewhere there was saying\nAnd and obviously in math they bombed the story that I spent a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and back then to not [noise]\nHis shirt pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him became shot anyway ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look of like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up tracking down towards the Base Camp\nWell Jason and his crew led to up the mountain\nNow it was four to one\nSaw like my rib cage was going to explode there was just a\nBall of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy has got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night\nAnd so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together\nAnd I'm always trying to find\nAnd I'm\nTrying to always kind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the

I stopped on a small ledge with Beth\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you
