to know you time [noise]\nMore inside of the retirement huddled thanks for being here today of course we've got a good game plan for you\nTo mark Howard lays it out for you every week and of course uh it's time for getting to know you we want to get to know the financial coach mark our little bit better mark what's places you visited but you never want to return\nTheir [laughter]\nWell I've been lucky enough to do some traveling in there's very few places that come to mind that would fall into that category but there is one one place that comes to mind and just because I had a bad experience there and\nIt it had to do back or in two thousand eleven the tenth anniversary of nine eleven I was in New York City\nAnd that was on a Sunday and so I called a plane\nFrom New York trying to get back to Atlanta\nAnd there were some weather issues and so forth so they landed is in Philadelphia by the time we got to Philadelphia basically there were no other flights from Philadelphia to Atlanta\nI needed to be in Atlanta Monday morning but they basically said we're going to put you up in a hotel that's the best we can do and so I was stuck in Philadelphia overnight and von they took us I probably shouldn't mention the airline I don't think they exist anymore but\nThe airlines took us to this hotel in the middle of a terrible part of town that was just just a nasty place\nAnd I'm sure Philadelphia's got some wonderful places I'm sure parts of that city you're beautiful unfortunately I didn't get to see him on that trip and I haven't gotten to see it ever so far but\nI finally got out of Philadelphia that next morning got to Atlanta missed most of my meetings and ah just don't have any fond memories right now Philadelphia where I'd want to go back anytime soon but I'm sure I'll give it another chance at some point\nI certainly don't blame you it is a a really great city and a lot of ways to put that particular experience right there is enough to turn you off that's for sure\nAnd it could have happened in any city I guess if the airline treated that way and took it to a terrible hotel in a terrible part of town so thanks for sharing that you're listening to retirement huddle I'm run along with mark our [noise]\nWhen you reflect on your life what would you like to see is your fondest memories summers that your favorite vacation spot ice cream with the grandkids after their first tee ball game\nMaybe it was your great adventure across the world or volunteering with a nonprofit of course those memories are still in the future although they're not as far away as you might think\nBe sure you have a financial planning to make them happen don't find yourself worrying wild enjoying about ice cream\nPeace of mind is attainable in your retirement with the proper planning you can secure a meaningful retirement\nFor complimentary visit with mark Howard and his team called eight eight eight five one one plan that's eight eight eight five one one Seventy five to six\nSchedule a complementary review of your financial situation called eight eight eight five one one plan that's eight eight eight five one one Seventy five to six [noise]\nFrying chicken isn't aren't sure anyone can cause a dog eat chicken into fryer but it takes skill to find the right balance of flower given season [noise]\nRetirement isn't much different it takes the right tools to craft the perfect plan to have like fried chicken your plan needs one or two ingredients unique from your goal is let's get cook in\nFucking back to the retirement huddle with coach who are cowards\nI'm Roger ... says here in the market of\nCourse is the president at Howard and financial group and wherever you are in the low countries savannah Hilton Head wherever you are you can come on and then have a conversation with\nA mark how are you about your situation no costs no obligation at all the phone number eight eight eight five one one plan that is eight eight eight five one one Seventy five to six\nWe got a great question in this week on the mail bag mark from Claire in Hilton Head and Claire says we recently got a letter promoting a program where we can split our mortgage payments in half their pay every two weeks instead of once a month\nSomehow this helps us pay it off faster is this something that we should consider doing\nClear thank you for your question it is a yeah it's called bi weekly mortgage payments\nAnd it is a great strategy in my opinion to pay off a mortgage faster because you're going to pay less interest over the loans lifetime doing it that way now how that works is if your payment is two thousand dollars a month you're going to pay half of it on the first and you're gonna pay half of it on the second\nAnd a lot of mortgage companies will go ahead and and set this up for you\nSo understanding the math involves like about it this way there's twelve months in a year\nBut there's twenty six pay periods and the year basically over the course of the year you end up making an extra payment and most people don't even steal it so by virtue of making Thirteen payments over the course of the year instead of twelve\nYou're going to take a thirty year mortgage really not come out of pocket with anymore and then you're going to pay it off and that you're going to say four and a half five years easy on your ah your mortgage so just one of many ways that you can can take a mortgage and in ... down faster and save a lot of interest in the process\nWow sounds like a good strategy and or if you could do that is certainly something to think about and to talk to mark how are you about and mark I know that the Claire may want to come in and and pursue that further and the other folks may as well so what do you have to offer those first time visitors\nWell for anybody that gives us a call we just we were going to do a complementary financial review for them they need to be one of the first ten callers Ron obviously we wish we could

other high profile Democrats\nOh okay All right Scott good enough things they care Bye bye bye yeah I so somebody a and the ... was it that warm where I met\nThis week it was in the fifties dropping down the mid thirties uh during the night but I saw somebody a painting a house in painters painting a house or\nWas it yesterday ... kind of re must have been like Wednesday ah but yeah you can paint in Chile whether they're going to pay ... or anything but the chilly weather you can you can paint gets right bank All right let's get to a Jerry Jerry welcome\nThank you for your program thank you sir\nI'm Gary I'm redecorating our home we're\nMoving I'm wallpaper two painted walls fashion prepping and painting paper wallpaper ... have a large master bad ... bathroom with vinyl wallpaper bring any experiments or suggestions for voting taking that down and painting over vinyl walk [noise]\nYou can paint over everything I say at all the time ... you really can a but it has um\nYou know it has drawbacks um is so ideally you always want to take paper off and if you can't\n... and there isn't much other choices yeah you you can certainly paying over but if you were if you were definitely going to do it preparation becomes the key like everything else they're your answer really scrub with them and make sure you get all the roads duo surface\nHopefully the seams are intact ... mood than that\nIt was so tight you can't get it off and then you would use just a good you know latex or curly bonding primer\nOr to the paper a and then you would come back in ah in pain on top of the primary ... use the paint with a primary so you kind of double priming yes um but what happens sometimes and just you know just so you know\nUm sometimes additional weight will actually in the in the moisture actually help remove paper I'm less so with vinyl\nA vinyl is more of a slick materials so the challenge here is to making sure that it doesn't feel from the vinyl and doing the bonding primer and then the pain with a primer\nWill usually take care of that\nSo did you how'd you how'd you do on the uh how'd you do on painting the paper paper\nOh absolute I'm In ... uh I I run or two after there's a lot of work because walls Ron prep for fame probably thought to stay there and it was well done uh probably we pay but\nI I used a dry wall mud on the same hand it to make sure it was it was ... and ... and everything was tied put a kill\nCote ... and then primer and then put a coat so a primer paint eggshell finish didn't get a single Bob now and it was absolutely thrilled with that and\nThey had been promoting the violin a big kitchen ... took a lot of prepping almost says if you were prepping any wall\nGosh track and I bought in that big master bath I'd be great and paper and\nPaper always paint a little better than the vinyl um I mean there's paper on drywall right so so it always paints a better than the vinyl the vinyl sometimes has a little bit of a texture to it yes uh the drywall compound is less likely to stick to it\nSo there's a little bit more challenges with that but if you get really good tight seems and you wash it real good and it doesn't have a texture to it and you put a primer on it you probably do All right I just hate to ever guarantee it because you never know you know it's that one a variable\nThat's right well thanks for taking my call and we enjoy your show\nThank you Jerry good luck to you that care about my married fourteen minutes after the top of the hour eight hundred\nEighty two three eight to five five that is our phone number by the way when he talked about kills kills the brand name made by master Kim and they make 'em a line of primaries\nUm the original kills was a stain blocking primer um you know if you had a water staying on the ceiling and you don't want it to bleed through your finished do you use the chills stained blocking primer that'll set this thing\nIf you're looking for an overall sick a primer I talked about being a bonding primer or the kills one\nIs in excellent primer that can be used over you know that situation of vinyl paper I'm In it it's a it's a very very good primer\nMy theory and see if you agree with the deer my theory is if you can stay in the category of the paint your used in other words if you decide to use a been more or sure when Williams or whatever brain you're using a bear I'm In you you pick this\nThe top of their in line a wall paint I Would take a look at their companion or sister primer to go with the kind of keep it in the family um there that they have been developed to work together\nSo that some but if you're not going to go then looking for an all purpose the kills total one is a very very good primer right that that you're a primer on primary oh drum

home we guarantee some news radio now seven point seven WBAI [noise]\nAll right back to work we'd go thirty three minutes after the top but they are kind of want to update you with the conversation I had with Gail\nJust to let you know what we're dealing with day after we spoke off the air one of the things that I'm a originally when she was talking that maybe there was something wrong with the pain and I said well jeez you know there's usually\nI'm I don't know how more than anything could be attributed to the pain itself and she contacted\nThe representative and a while was determined to that point when it wasn't drying as they may have used the wrong color and\nIn the solid color stain which was which makes sense that it wouldn't dry\nColor and for the most part and I'm Talking about generic color and the Jews them ... or done they have drying features which would extend the drank time which could allow for other sports to get in tangled in the sticky pain which could cause the growth now\nShe's talking about using all kinds of clear she talked about a thirty second cleaner which is a good cleaner\nI'm said that didn't work at all um use the wedding forget and that was about five weeks ago so sometimes of went and forget to include the temperatures extends the active time so I don't think that was really given enough time to really work\nOr wherever we kinda left it is pursuing it through the bank company but in the meantime getting just a good grade of oxygen they bleach work on a smaller and scrub it and see if we can remove it\nFrom there because at this point when we have issues with things around our house\nWe don't know what that is when she was first talking one of the things and I didn't even address this with her um and it didn't sound like it would be this but uh it it could be in some other cases um when you have mulch and maybe this happened to you\nA hardwood mulch specially inexpensive hardwood mulch spread around your home\nThere is um [noise]\nA byproduct to that I guess I guess that's where you would say it is a cold artillery fungus or shotgun fungus\nSo is that most breaks down it shoots these hard spores all over the wall on in glass I've seen them cars it's virtually impossible to remove\nLiterally and if even if you were moved with a razor blade ... of the glass or something to leave a little yellow stain\nNow I don't think that's what her as she was I'm not really sure exactly what that issue was because we don't know what's on it we don't know what that stain or you know what's on it and also we've had a couple of mysteries today\nAnd sometimes you just got to dig deeper deeper deeper I left with her I think she needs to work it through the pain company in the store for the wrong tent was used that could have implications on many things\nOn the outside of the house outside of just not drawing properly alright eight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab a line happened to take your calls as we marched through another weekend she'll walk them\nHey Sheila\nHello yes I live real meeting replacement my neighbor has had his room when\nGod not houses were built when they had let her family and I knew that his they cook them first layer of um [noise] higher or show\nAnd I put on and I went down and then put some kind of I don't know I think of something and then he put that new I ... everything that black tile and\nWho have told them they don't you say I'm a valley anymore and that caused problems are not as good I I'd never heard that before so I came to you\nWell it's called a California weeds and or your roofers wrong they do use metal valleys they still use metal valleys of galvanized in pain them they use copper valleys in in my opinion I think those valleys are actually better\nUm versus the California we've uh California we've used by a lot of roofers\nBut um you know my opinion is I kind of like the metal valleys that doesn't mean you have to have him that's just my opinion I'm not I'm\nNot in that room before I went to look for I guess I Want to know hey we only have one layer of child his head takeoff shingles I mean it will take off all the shingles it don't put the shingles on top of an old one because they make them Michael\n[noise] um you can put a second layer of shingles on top of an existing layer of shingles and they'll say be a little bit of money um I kind of go back to the thing is I probably wouldn't do that\nI'm a first of all a lot of roof worn teaser avoided if you go over in existing layer of shingles\nOkay I'm also a ...\nIt's always good to check what's going on underneath those shingles in case she had some water damage or something maybe some would needs to be replaced it doesn't give you a smooth the look and you're saving a little money but it's ... it's a little money it's not\n... if I tell him I tell them about taking the original shingle off and putting stuff on the mall was correct yes have Halle stuff\nI'm going to talk to the people I can hear 'em before I start to anybody I wanted to talk to you and make sure that I got some um\nYeah and you and you bring up a really good point to Sheila because I'm I'm you know some refers to the California we even in swear by it okay but you know I'm saying I like the middle valleys in the reason having these conversations is\nIt's all about the quality of the roof or you know that other roof or he was good to he was saying teeth I wouldn't put it over the old layer I'd really recommend stripping absolutely\nBut I always say this people ask me all the time what's the best shingle I said don't door that single worried about the roof or get the best route for you Ken okay now the next\nQuestion what is the vantage they let ... valley ... over the ah Californian\nI I'm not really sure I can tell you what the advantages it's more long lasting it's more it's less\nI'm more susceptible to being intact if there was a lot of wind\nOkay that you know there is a real reason for me I'm a lot also\nAnd uh the unfortunately that part I'm not going to be able to help you with but yeah if it's if it's solving the problem of by taping the panels ...

Fox News\nRussia's new now more at home with Gary Solomon on news radio ... seven points in double duty chaos\nThis project of the week is brought you buy the metal roofing alliance [noise] All right back at it we go thirty three minutes after the top of their you're at home with Gary Sylvan all morning\nI've been telling ya we gotta talk about backup\nPumps and I know many of you get a little bit I'm not confused but you you're in for information on which way I should go because there's battery backups there's water driven back up\nAnd then there's also the quality issue of different back up so I have more kind of Brinker in he is director of marketing with those all are pumped company and the mark thanks for joining me appreciate it great to be here Gary as always it's probably been a busy year for you because it's been a wet year all across the United\nStates yes it has more sure has been up a across the board pretty steadily throughout the year and um [noise] you know fortunately we're we're in a every market around the U.S and we'd been able to serve our customers are where you know pumps of have run and and had been needed to be replaced\nI guess you guys kind of watch the weather a little touch if we do we analyze whether\nI don't I you know we're going to be more than half hour to go\nDo touch you almost have to but there\nIs a unique company I'm based in Louisville, Kentucky right\nYeah right so we have over four hundred people in Louisville, Kentucky I'm over three hundred people in our plant there working day in day in day out I'm very proud of what they do make an a quality product um got over a hundred\nOr support personnel as well that uh provide products for customer support and everything we need to do to do a quality product in and support that product\nI'm sitting here with my little phone and that's a ... that even has to do with some pumps now uh because everything seems to be managed by our phones these days I was a a a little gathering about four weeks ago in a beautiful home\nAnd before we got to his home he was setting the lighting he was setting the temperature he was opening blinds he was doing everything on his boat he had music gone when we're rides and the lights were uh in\nWhich is really cool but with some pubs using how the world is the phone getting involved there but really it's a great safety feature\nYeah so our focus on on that smart home technology in through apps and computers right now is around our battery backup system um we have an ability um through why fire in the house uh through a a controller or a gateway\nOn our system that allows 'em\nThe user to receive notifications I'm actually be able to run a palm test that backup sure some pomp and case rains are coming I'm set up parameters I make sure the batteries charge make sure that power is on\nUm really for that peace of mind you know earlier in the Bahamas and you've got a rainstorm come and I'm I'm you know you you can actually test that backup pumps for peace of mind to know that it's going to run if that primary palm because\nThere is a worry about that especially if you're pumped as real active and you're in Cleveland, Ohio and you're on vacation or you're away on work it it'd be kind of settling to just see if it's functionally\nRight I I think you know something to kind of a basic principle is on that primary stomp Tom I'm One is it's an electrical mechanical\nDevice right right and you never know than ours are eventually going to fail\nAnd you've got the whole power issue ... man I Know you were talking about and I was listening on the way in talking about power and generators and things like that right right um is that uh at the power goes out the primary some pumps not going to run and everywhere battery backup can help you out\nI should know this but I don't is there any state in the union that is code to have a backup [noise] uh that's a mandatory\nYet made a that's a good question I I'm not sure it ended um there's been some things going back and forth in the industry eventually I ready to get my own Jew right right and and insurance companies and things yeah there's\nGot to be a lot of push to have that done a but it you folks a list there's always say we don't need the government to tell us everything well let me tell you a a backup pumped is really critical especially if you have a lower level\nFinished yeah no no doubt I'm so just for the listeners that don't know what a battery backup or some pump system is that it works as a backup obviously to your primary some pomp which we've talked about\nUh it comes with a a a a a a a actually a a a backup stumped pomp and then I'll get back to in a minute comes with a cane can come with a battery you can acquire a battery along with it comes with\nIt controller controls and charges helps charge the battery and then on what we call our active systems comes with a gateway that allows you to communicate through your phone company there and and and\nWhy is all pumps aren't the same\nTrue trimming new ... where's the difference I mean everything has a way we can cut this out for price but then that becomes it's acutely see all\nRight so we're proud of um about three or four years ago we used to a kind of resell our backup some pomp and every word at which point for the marine industry\nWell we went to the drawing board or engineering and manufacturing teams did a great job where we actually manufacture a true battery backups ... now\nStrictly for ... strictly for ... wells I'm not for other applications and um that pump has a lot of things but just kind of cut to the chase a that pump will produce or performs at the same level as a primary some pop well\nOkay because I Know for a fact that a lot of battery backups lotta brands pumped about half the rate of regular primary pumped correct right okay in that range there in what your battery backup called notes got a nice name\nYeah so it's the model ... ... we're not active okay I'm that actually comes in in what we're talking about there is a comes into different versions that comes in a in an active or a non active active as the wife I option which we talked about\nAnd mark I know you're um\nSome pumps or rolls sold through\nPlumbers right that's the network and I think you know some people may just turned ... Gary ... how can some poems take a half hour to explain it because there's a lot going on here right and even in picking a primary pop you got", "year": "2018", "show_name": "At Home with Gary Sullivan", "city": "Savannah", "day": "27"}
