Howard financial group dot com but the number to call the most immediate way to get in touch is by calling eight eight eight\nFive one one plan but his eight eight eight five one one seven five to six get on the calendar come in have a conversation with coach mark ...\nLet's go to the mail bag we have some great questions that have come in as always our first question today is from Ben in Savannah\nBen says I've owned my own business for Twenty years and I'm thinking about retirement within the next three to four years and my better off to try and sell the business or retain ownership and hope my employees can run it effectively without me actually being there\nWill bend thanks for your your a letter but I think the key word and what you have written to us you and your question is the word hope\nYou hope your employees getting ready to effectively without you being there I think there's a huge risk leaving the business of them are only you know what kind of employees they are I don't know that you can assume they're going to ever run like you've run it and the boy it's running now and the fact that you really wanting to retire in the next three or four years\nTwo things I Would sit down with a good business broker and just kind of get an idea of what kind of value your business is a I don't know what kind of business it is but certainly get a value and the other is starting to utilize the benefits of a retirement income plan or they can start putting those pieces together so you can look at Social Security\nYou can look at a possible income stream from the business or in a nest egg of a lump sum that comes from the sale of it\nAnd and see how that's going to work in your retirement to see what's going to work out best for you\nAll right our next question here is from Olivia and cooler and Olivia says are long term care premiums are going up this year and pretty significantly should we just pay the extra cost or Catholic and take our chances\nOlivia long term care premiums are going up a lot on people and some people are being surprised by it I don't think you've got just two choices here may be as many as four options for you and your situation\nSometimes it's beneficial just to talk to the company and maybe reduced the coverage so that you still got it\nSometimes the policies have a return premium option\nSometimes we've got a lot of people that have used fixed indexed annuities as a part of a retirement income planning piece that has a long term care benefits to it and it's not necessarily a replacement for long term care but it can take care of a lot of long term care type needs\nAnd then the other thing is there's there's new products coming out right now that are long term care based without actually having a long term care policy that is they use it or lose that type of scenario so we can certainly sit down and see if there might be some options therefore yet but uh would need to know obviously a lot more about\nYour overall financial picture how much these premiums are have gone up and how much it's impacting you financially and to see what all the options are for you be happy to do that\nAll right one more question today from Hilton Head and grace and does the honors gray says my dad just died six months ago and I'm a little worried about my mom who's in her late seventies and is now in charge of handling the investments for the very first time in her life I don't know much about it myself why should I tell her to do\nWell first of all grace you have my deepest condolences on the loss of your father I lost mine many years ago and there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about him and miss him\nAnd you know grace it's only been six months you're still in the grieving process and while I'm sure you feel like there's a lot of decisions that need to be made right now\nMy advice would be to get with a good attorney and um you know it's hard to make decisions when you're grieving and a good attorney can just help you get the estate through probate if that's the process is going on now more important than anything just give you some peace of mind and some clarity during\nYou know what it is an incredibly stressful time and your family's life so you know once again I'm so sorry about your father that's what I Would do is just sit down with somebody that can really help you through this period until you get to a point where you've got a little bit more clarity and feel like you can make some good decisions\nWell grace I Would suggest you come in and have a conversation with mark coward and the same goes for Olivia and Ben banks all three of you for great questions on today's show thanks very much for being a part of it and a marketing to there are a lot of people out there who would like to come in and hear the answer their questions face to face what do you have to offer those books\nI worked really closely with the safe shelter for domestic violence here in Savannah I I've been on the board for about eight years and just roll off\nBut we partnered with him here at Howard financial group and we want to help them and just continue the incredible work that they do this month as domestic violence awareness month so anybody who's willing to make a contribution of ten dollars\nTo save shelter where not only going to match ten dollars

agency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfraid on it and say yes and let's say it's come off ... contract that so\nIt really never came off or whatever okay okay now what I was trying to wondering\nWhat is going on we have an irrigation system if I may be that what it was hitting that tired of the house would probably help that yeah so we quit briefing on that side of a gift well\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah yeah\nI hear ya it does um so it is a fluorescence I'm sure there is salts in may scenario products of bricks the mortar between the bricks\nAnd when that becomes compromised and um get sweat a lot that's how it becomes compromise those salts begin to bloom\nAnd they started out as white shadows and they can actually get to a point where literally looks like table salt on the surface of the brick\nAnd um you know I'm sure what the folks who sold Jew\nOr isn't a fluorescence remove or I Can't tell you why would not work I can tell you however when you use an F ... remover um it will remove the F ... but that doesn't mean it's not going to come back\nThe other ... there's some deterioration\nTaken place in there's moisture outside and it will continue\nTo be a challenge to keep that off but once you use a cleaner it should be clean for a while so that part I don't understand um you know one of the products I've mentioned for this as quick creek makes a product called a fluorescence in rushed remover\nA knee and it requires an application requires some scrubbing rinsing et cetera and then I Would get a brick sealer on there to minimize the amount of water penetration that can get into the breaking get into the border\nSo it will slow the process of that ...\nBlooming so you know that's that's my story but I don't know why the other stuff lemon juice isn't strong enough of it but if he got rotted she went to a brick company I'm sure they ... and ... and F ... remover in I I don't know\nIf they did why that didn't work unless it are heated applications did you check back with them and express why that didn't work or followed all the directions and everything\nYeah I'm going to go back to them that lever on the road listening to even try not to call in the navy yeah oh yeah I'm\nJust guessing they sold you a product that that that would work I you know I don't know why wouldn't work but again it's a long term um ... it's a long term problem Mary and that's just kind of really what I wanted to emphasize you clean it off and I would get that a brick sealed\nIts brick sailor yes mhm is that we need to get it off first but you got to get it off or is\nThat okay we can get by on Oregon ... um we power washed the damage ... power wash\nRight power wash it actually exacerbate the problem because you're putting water that you're kind of force and into that brick okay so that\nSo you know again you can check out that quick create a fluorescence remover read that book ... you know instructions follow him to the letter of the law and then get a good missionary brick sealer on that house and that'll slow down the process\nOkay what what's your name again cook\nQuick create ...\nAnd rust remover\nCame over and learning and get that\nI'm Home Depot Lowe's some you\nCan get it on line to\nKnock out might be what my ... and I got it might be it might be I mean it's good to Home Depot and it's a good go to product\nOkay I'll Try that\nYep just to make sure we read those directions thoroughly\nMake sure we follow the entire process of how it should be done because it it'll work it may require a second application\nAnd again I don't really know what the what they ah um you know soldiers but I'm assuming it would be a product of mild acid that would potentially moved that ... followed a correctly or one other thing too is I I talked about a brick\nMasonry sealer I talk a lot about um a website called masonry defender dot com and they make a again a breed the bowl and that's what you need breed the ... behind that brick that it can breed that moisture through\nUh the surface so and then minimize or eliminate the water penetration from the outside in so it's got to be a reasonable sealer I talk a lot it's kinda like cortex for your brick home\nAll

way if you'd like to jump on board do so it's eight hundred eight two three eight\nTo five five and happy to take your calls so let's get to a ... vive welcome\nOn I live here in the ... uh and I I had a safety trial ranch with glass while I like to cook last Monday the base and I had put an end wider ten times come through the edges of the existing lend itself\nI think last block Linda's advertised with smarter and silicon between the glass box and I and also on the ... and I wonder what your car car\nI still kind of like\nThe the mortar but you're not going to go wrong with the silicone either I mean I don't think there's a right or wrong way the problem if you're if you're trying to get to the solution on which way to go because of water infiltration\nThe real thing though because water will infiltrate through mortar it's not going to infiltrate true silicone\nBut if there's enough water you create other pressures or other problems because of the pressure with silicon so I Would say either or their eve but really concentrate on\nHow we can eliminate the water issue to begin with\nRight okay so maybe wait glass lock and in college and telling them to to talk about that water\nYeah so do you know what is cause cause in the water upon their\nIdea we are neighbors had changed made and their water diversion context literally when we're having rain and share share of water running down there he'll hide down to a concrete\nAnd actually we had the country and it gets down gravel a gravel walkway that but that right up to our house and where the windows are as\nYou know they're tiny an inch or two of water that contain water cascading town right next to yes filling it can go with like I'm perfect strangers\nYeah probably a friend who trained underneath ... walk would work mostly if you have fall to move that water\nOkay and how would we get a recommendation for a local kind of thing where the heck\nI'm either but it's been a long time since I kind of dug into it to be honest with you I only have one for you [laughter] I'm Sorry to report I landed on the one that you know I'm sure that I I think since ... glass block was probably one of the larger ones\nUm but I really haven't delved into it to be wrong recommend somebody\nOkay All right thanks very already take care thank you Bye bye yeah good you\nKnow that's a shame a good question though because really again we always go back to that it really is all about the ... water control I'm certainly you can put a mortar glass block habits sealed probably\nYou know unless you have a really big big time problem not gonna you know water will uh be repelled silicone too but it you got to take care of that water problem or both of them will eventually it'll cause a problem water we either get in or you have a problem with the quest block eight hundred eight to three to five five\nThe phone number if you'd like to join us let's get to Bruce Bruce welcome\nSir [noise] [noise]\nYeah the question for you um read two and a house here in the Cleveland area and I've got a marble um window sills and the\nPrevious owner is yet gotten pain go of about ... and I was wondering what is safe for you to remove that came from the ... what kind of products like\nIs it just bladders Bruce ... are pretty much\nBrush strokes from a court a paint job up cutting and well I'm so you know if it's a latex paint I Do not know that okay\nI'm I'm going to give you the so to find out if it's latex or oil base you can take some rubbing alcohol in in Rob the paint with a rubbing alcohol if it's if it's oil base it will get shiny if\nIt's latex it'll get sticky and gummy if it's latex you can use a product like Google on\nOr product called ... and then it is for removing latex paint and we kind of exactly\nWhat you have splatter marks brush strokes whatever um but it's not going to work on oil base so folks listening to ... you know latex paint splatter on would your thing floor you can use the goo gun or the hopes to remove that\nPain [noise] um if\nSo that's that's how you would remove but also a pain stripper that I talked about earlier Bruce that is totally non caustic\nUm you could use a ... they're called blue bear um you could just brush it on and then the next morning come back and literally just wipe it away\nOkay yeah we're we're a where
