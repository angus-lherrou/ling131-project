{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "And this is really important a steady reliable source of retirement income that that is increasingly important\nAs a part of a retirement income strategy so it's so much at stake in which you ten years out you're you're in that retirement red zone so love to sit down with it and see where you are and find out exactly what your goals are and and and see how we can make that happen but with so much at stake it's it's important you feel\nThat you sit down with somebody not only chicken trust but that can consider a variety of solutions for you everybody's different and and there's no one solution that's right for everybody so you want to just make sure that you're sitting down with somebody that can give you the guidance\nThat can put together a plan that's customized for your unique situation\nAnd there's some great independent professionals out there a lot of them are self employed most of the time you don't find them working for as a captive type of agent with a like a New York live for a north western mutual or Edward Jones or that type of thing so typically it's your independent people that have specialized and retirement income planning\nAnd they can make sure you're on track and they can make sure that that retiring and fifty five goal is attainable for you\nWell it sounds like you've done well for yourself into certainly you're right to get in touch with mark come on and have a conversation with mark Howard about your situation and make sure that you can actually achieve that goal Jeffrey is in Boston and Jeffrey's question is this\nI've heard you talking about being aware of the risk and your portfolio we've been talking about that earlier today he goes on to say I'm sixty five exactly how much risk should I be taking\nJeffrey great question thank you for the question I think it's fantastic that you are thinking about that at age sixty five\nBecause quite honestly you know we had a financial crisis that ripped through Wall Street ten years ago and it pushed our global economy to the edge of an abyss\nAnd there's just you know you would think that those experience would have created a learning opportunity for a lot of people about how to manage risk better and you know just understand the the imbalances in the financial markets and\nAnd all of those different things but there's a lot of folks that have amnesia about ten years ago so the fact that you're actually aware of the fact that you may have risking your portfolio\nOne of the first ways to do it and it's kind of some people call it an outdated way but there's something called the rule of one hundred Jeffery and basically what it does is it allows you to subtract your age from one hundred hundred monitor sixty five is thirty five so that is a good way to determine\nHow much of your portfolio should be at risk so at age sixty five only thirty five percent of your portfolio should be exposed to any type of vehicle where if there's a market correction that could hurt you suggested that means sixty five percent of your portfolio should be safe\nIn immune to market correction most people do not have that type of makeup and their portfolio so that's a good rule to go by but once again let's sit down with a financial advisor that focus on retirement income planning that can do one of those\nStress test for you that can find out what your goals are about when you want to retire and just make sure that if there is a market correction\nThat if we have some kind of a traumatic event with the markets or just a just a twenty percent or twenty five percent correction like typically happens about every three and a half to four years that it's not gonna devastate your plans about moving forward and retiring when you want to\nWatch every kind of a head of the game because he's asking this question about how much risk having his portfolio a lot of people haven't really thought about that and have no idea how much risk various so\nIf you're out there listening today come on and have a conversation with mark and uh he can dig in and find out how much risk you have in your portfolio a lot of people are shocked when they find out\nAren't last question they asked from Vivian in Savannah\nAnd Vivian says mark I'll listen to your show every week and I really enjoy it\nShe goes on to say I don't think my kids are expecting an inheritance from me because I was a single mom for most of their lives but I really want to be sure that I'm not a financial burden for them at any point should I work until I'm Seventy so that I can take the highest possible Social Security benefit or\nVivian thank you for your question that's a great question and more and more people that were sitting down with are saying that very same thing I Do not want to be a burden on my family\nSo it's great to be thinking about that obviously we would need to sit down with you and find out where you are financially how much you've got saved and do a Social Security analysis for you and we'd be happy to do that you know a lot of people have looked to long term care insurance to make sure that they're not going to be a burden on their families\nBut there's a lot of people that either can't afford it long term care insurance because it's pricey\nOr some people just can't qualify so there have been some wonderful alternatives to long term care that have come down the pike over just the last few years there are new ladies that provide long term care type benefits and there's even some insurance other insurance based type products\nThat can can help you offset the cost of unexpected health care situations in a lot of different ways so I\nWould just say you know before you decide you're going to work till Seventy let's look at your entire picture will do Social Security analysis for you see where you are see if there's some things that we can put in place for you to possibly help you help protect your your assets from a long term care type of health crisis we would love to do that for you\nAbout a great questions today here on the show and there are other folks out there who have questions that remain unanswered for now but they can take care of that little situation by just coming in and and have a conversation with you and your office and a mark ... I Know that you always love meeting these new ...\nYeah I really do and we just want to offer an opportunity for the folks that are listening to come in we can do it for the first Fifteen callers Ron and we're we're passionate about making sure that these folks that come in have all the bases covered in retirement we've always felt like God blesses things when you when you offer him to people in and\nHe's really blessed our company and so we want to offer this in one of the things that we could just take a little bit of the fear and uncertainty out of people's retirement\nThan we feel like we're doing something that that that has looked upon on\nFavorably so first thing we are going to do Social Security what age should just start taking that benefit so for someone like ... that would be one of the first things that we would do how does it fit into your overall income picture because that's not a decision that you make in a in a vacuum or a silo\nOr how much risky taken in your portfolio how much you paying fees you have an income plan in place are you in danger of running out of money\nYou have a plan to to address inflation long term care leaving the legacy so if you're realizing that you're getting close to retirement or even if you're in retirement and you just have an address some of those issues and there knowing at ya\nOnce again Ron the review is complimentary all people got to do is make the call our calendar fills up quickly so we'll do it for the first Fifteen callers to call in to just go ahead give us a call right now and we will make sure that we get a spot reserved for it\nAnd that number to call his eight eight eight five one one plan that's eight eight eight five one one plan eight eight eight five one one seven five to six that'll put you

comes to the fate of missing\nJournalist Washington Post contributor to mark ... hasn't been seen since enjoying the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second officials in Turkey allege he was murdered something Saudi Arabia denies President Trump was asked about the allegations during an interview with CBS is sixty minutes\nIn the ... as you mentioned earlier you basically just take off your old light fixture and replace it with the new fixture and you just use the existing wiring is already there yeah no additional wires yeah it was all everything else has wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minutes a project and you turn off the break or by the way so\nGood points by a very good very good turnout to brag are literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more\nThan ten minutes and um they had a nice little diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide in\nBlack wearing a black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely any download the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy process\nOkay so seriously it is that easy as the I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood light Sylvia of a old flood light you can just simply\n... yes if you get a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd um I went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\nSouth really has a lot like the maximum flood light is easier to mail that a flood light you buy the big ... really is because of the quick ... am absolutely have really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera and light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's that your door\nSo I'm at work you get all of them in the ... in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notified makes the sound\nOr with the to the ad sewage whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise what however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive\nAnd you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar alarm that can be press\nSo if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taken aback each um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for for downloading viewing later\nSo so if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter] you can see if there's kids come into the house and see a lot ... usually not every child legs are products [laughter] we've heard lots of stories last couple of years\nTo sell this coach like with camera or are these prevalent or do you were the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing\nOr yeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the poor side does come and different um different styles and different finishes 'cause we trying to accommodate you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any ... competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there you know as a release the porch lights we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nAnd our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera and the quality of the cameras detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera\nIt's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the for more on the products we actually use less resources so\nUm we're not as resource hum heavy so our products will work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good um customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\nAnimals was oh am really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time\nI'm it's just it's again there's so many\nHum features in our app that customers really like and what we hear that you know quite often\nNow on the coach like with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle when you talk about the distance but its position of all too\nYeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the flow of light and the coach later the other a poor choice we put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed the product\nYou want to aim that cameras or you get the optimal a field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a lock and rainy and lock that camera and the place and then and typically it just stays there then\n... but when you're watching when you're watching the um the either the live feed or you're watching a video later you can ... you can actually ... so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close if using them in with the pension is great great\nSo I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines of someone that has a question about the maximus lighting or whether they have um\nA any questions on on on security and safety around your

obviously it's going to blow\nSo sure of the um the view of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten seconds buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you got to get to the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there's also other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that light off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so but\nVery good question to die and you're thinking\nLike not alarm goes off on your phone at how many were actually not a light off the wall faith so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app\nDoes sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right\nNot All right Diane thank you care so it is smart importer than we already said hundred eight to three to five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI uh I have a question we shoot the runaround what trick or treaters arch\n... yes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick a motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know look out your window you can see them\nUm you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any type\nOf care is very true I have turned off every ten minutes without turning around the house or ordering if they are the way to get the sense that\nThey're absolutely so there's two things one is you can you can control the zones are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turn to the bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once you saw the product you can kinda tune\nYou know which alert you want to get the ones that matter and again we've we've built all that features into the product in the apple very cool and then\nSee that's man you got to think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by\nThe questions again is eight

third generation of granted expertise with granite gold and Lenny welcome that home with Gary Sullivan\nHey Gary how you doing I'm doing great I'm doing great before we get into protecting granted I just had a caller and he was talking about some grand a gold products and he had a question I couldn't answer about granted since you're the man them when they asked you perfect your rent All right he he bought a house\nJust kinda moved in and were there apparently there's labs are granted that he has a theme\nAnd this theme is a kind of like a v it's wider tub then goes down to nothing but it's deep you get a finger nail in it how do you see all that or does it have to actually be repaired with like granted dust\nWell with the with the seems you know that's done by the the fabrication slicing company and okay and some are some are better than others and if it wasn't filled all the way and sometimes when you do put the puck seeing their it'll set a little bit um [noise]\nThe best way to fill it is within a pop the residents of but I definitely suggests using\nEither the fabricate or Henri told and restoration guy to come out and fill it\nOr they'll use like a clear up a ... rather than to to fill it so it's not you know that fingernails the ... with this should be flushed with the stone\nSure so there's no granted dust being uses just ended up pox e clear ... does put in there\n[noise] yeah we you know my family\nYou know we have a fabric each company right around forty forty years so we've been dealing with a lot and we actually when we first do that she met install we actually use a pigments to match the color of the stone ha ha ha maybe we can we use it a ... year resident too\nFor that seat okay and sometimes when you just need to feel like\nA pet or you know the game itself you can declare rather than for it\nAnd I told him I thought it'd be going to be require an expert but one of the things you said you got to find a good one now do you do that\n[laughter] I Know it it it is tough and uh we work with a lot of granite fabric caters and a restoration specialists stuff and we can always help event that so if you reach out to the grand old we can kind of help you know where you're at the ones that we work with\nVery good thanks thanks now what we want to do is avert disaster [laughter]\nYeah ... and you regret the gold dot com is a great I'm a resource um where you can find a lot of information and how to take your granted but ah one of the first things is do you have to take care of granted what should we do to take care of granted\nUm especially with granted it's a natural this central stone so its Mother Nature it's fight it\nOn even though it's journal and it's hard it's still susceptible to stain on so one of the most important thing about natural stone is to seal it on the other big factor there is not to use any ordinary household cleaners because\nIt'll take that see they're off and it will do the surface
