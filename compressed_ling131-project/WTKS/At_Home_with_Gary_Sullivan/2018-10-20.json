{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Want to learn more about your local financial coach mark cower to visit the team on line at Howard financial group dot com that's our financial group does ah\nThey're listening to retirement huddle with the one and only mark our\nHe is the coach coach mark Howard of Howard financial group ... decided to join us today eight eight eight five one one plan eight eight eight five one one seven five to six you're a regular listener to show you know what it's all about if you're new today\nThanks for joining us and you're probably going to learn a lot about retirement getting ready for it to particularly if you find yourself in the red zone in the years leading up to your retirement the show is going to be very important information for him the retirement huddle mark our number one more time is eight eight eight five one one plan\nMarc let's go to the mail back here we have some great questions that have come in first of all Aaron in Savannah says I have a pension fund from a previous job at a different state\nIt's just been sitting there for years and years I have the option to take a lump sum and invest the money myself should I Do that or just leave it where it is and get a monthly pension when I retire\nOr air and thank you for your question I'm working with someone right now in that same boat and it's always an interesting question it and sometimes we just got to do some math and sometimes it's not a clear cut mathematical\nProblem or solution either but you know can you draw it out that you want to leave it do you want to wait till you're sixty five course it comes down to what other types of\nSavings that you've got what your retirement income goals are and and how close you are too I'm wanting to execute those\nMany times it just comes down to this do you want the control and flexibility of having those funds under your own investment umbrella so to speak as opposed to leaving it with a pension fund\nAnd sometimes you just don't know how that's being managed\nWe've seen a lot of funds go bankrupt\nWe've seen a lot of pension funds that have had to cut pension payments because they were assuming they were built on a seven or eight percent type of growth model\nAnd with the low interest rates that we've seen over the past ten years they haven't come anywhere close to that so there are pensions that are becoming insolvent so you know we're very fair minded on this we want to do what makes you feel better and we're very good at it just kind of\nGetting to the root of it and laying out all the options for you and letting you decide which one that you're most comfortable with and which ones work best for you\nAre right here and thank you for the question and hope that answers satisfy you but if you like to talk more about it you can certainly get in touch with mark and come on and for that conversation\nOur next question is from Oscar in Boston for years he says he's had half of his money with one broker\nAnd half with someone else and they're both nice guys and he thought it would be good to get advice from two different people but now it just seems a little confusing and Oscar wants to know if he's better off to have it all in one place instead of split between two people\nAnd it's a great question Oscar saying thank you for for writing in\nThere's a lot of investors that won't allow you to have money into places and and I think that's kind of interesting you know it's kind of like being a high school football player and you're you're a good athlete and you're being recruited by a lot of colleges and you decide you're going to commit to both Georgia in ... you know ...\nThere's a there's a lot of colleges aren't going to like the exact with our company philosophy is a little bit different\nSince we really focus on retirement income planning\nSo many of our clients still have portfolios that are being managed by other advisors\nAnd you know perhaps they've had that relationship for many years and so we don't require them to move it all the U.S and we're not looking to sever relationship that may have existed for many many years but since our specially and expertise is different than those advisors\nThe clients sees the benefit of having some funds with us in vehicles that reduced risk protect principle provide guaranteed lifetime income streams that preparing for retirement so we're able to keep it simple\nSo that aspect of having to advisors isn't complicated you know it's kind of like having a doctor\nAnd you know you go to one for your heart in one for your allergies or something like that or you know being a triathlete him and the coach for swimming in a different coach recycling so we can make it easy but everybody's a little different some people like to move their entire portfolio over to us and some people still like to maintain that relationship that they've had for many years\nOkay got time for one more question today your next one is from ... and ... and ... says we never lived on a budget are\nOur lives my husband is very resistant to having a budget wants to retire but without a budget how do we make sure that we don't run out of money ten years before we die good question yes it is well\nThis gets down to kind of the ... there's a difference between a budget and an income plant\nYou know there's a lot of people that come in that it just never worked off a strict budget\nBut they've got a pretty good idea in the back of their mind how much is coming in\nWhat the bills or in when the money runs out before the month runs out you know and they know go get we got to stop spending that we got another check in\nBut an income plans different and an income plan is very crucial when it comes to retirement because you've got to know up front before you execute retirement where those sources of guaranteed income\nWhere those paychecks are going to come from 'cause the the real paycheck is stopped so you know you can still live like you did before retirement was kind of a loose budget in mind but at least with an income planned it's important to know which must but you know\nWhere that incomes coming from and that it's gonna last even if you lived to a hundred it's going to continue going to be there for you regardless of how long you live\nA lot of good questions that have come in on today's show from marriage to fend are also from Oscar in areas and another there are lots of listeners out there who have questions for you would like to come in and have a conversation [noise] what would that be like when they walk into your office\nWell Ron ... one of our clients said boy this was like having coffee with an old friend we've got beautiful offices over here in Savannah off as an hour drive and we're just going to sit down and have a conversation and find out about them is a discovery session there's no cost for the visit is just a chance\nFor us to to be a blessing to them to give them a little bit of an education about their money help them make some good decisions and and we're going to put down on paper\nA retirement game plan for you know there's a lot of people just don't have a true understanding of some of the basic things like how much they're paying in season commission and how much risk they're taking what their nest egg and the tax implications of their retirement savings and those things that we're going to just sit down and help them understand all of those issues\nAnd um we can't do it for everybody so if you're one of the first Fifteen callers\nYou got all the money saved for retirement we're going to make time on our calendar to visit with we're going to do it complimentary we're going to put together that financial game plan for you and I'll promise you'll find that to be a pleasant experience we would really look forward to sit down with\nEight eight five one one place that is a five eleven plan

Fox News metal barricades tossed by migrants hoping to cross into Mexico from Guatemala Mexican police in riot gear responded with tear gas I think to push back the throngs of people who hope to ultimately reach the U.S\nThere is a product by ... Tron called liquid would\nWhich would harden that would and then you could reach stain or repaint\nIf you do go in that direction my recommendation would be after you use the liquid would and it just harms the existing\nTeam won a Lebanese get some talking at the bottom of that open grain and even if you just smeared on with your finger if you want to paint it that's fine too that'll sealed but I like to use the cruelly talking just mere across the bottom of that and that are really waterproof in seal up\nThat open grain so that's an acrylic a silken ice talking for that uh another thing you can do is you can get in there and just cut off the bottom you know six inches or the bottom foot\nJust cut removed that T. one eleven\nCut another strip that said same distance you're going to have a scene there just nail that back in and take some of the a clear acrylic talking put it at the bottom of that board and also in that scene and then go ahead and paint that a shutout\nA or staying that shut out whatever you want to do but make sure those seams are I'm certainly sealed and you'll eliminate the problem it's a\nAnd and so there's three ways to go ahead and take care of that problem All right sorry Bob we did have a difficult time hearing you apologize All right let's go from a Bob we'll go to Rick Rick\nWelcome Hi how are you yes are fine thank you for taking my call you bet I\nI have a I have a question I uh my front porch and trench uh we had family over and and I put a garbage bag outside\nOnto the concrete and apparently the grease or whatever so through the bag onto the concrete and now there's a big about three foot strained by eight inches house one or if there's a way to get rid of that\nYet is that Greece is that what it is great from meats or what is it yeah yeah okay\nUm what have you tried to be tried like dawn liquid soap or anything along those lines\nI I did not um I was afraid to use anything to push it back in ... so um\nI got to to suggestions one I feel\nReal certain about the other one would subscribe and you might get it done so when I say the dawn I'm a lot depends on how sealed or how um deep that Greece ran into that concrete which is what you read about two but Don brand the liquid so\nIf you put that on there just you know full strength\nA damp at a scrub brush and just really work at it and work at it and work at it and then flush it and then maybe put some more dawn on their lead set come back and really working with a scrub brush you might remove that\nUm but it's going to take some scrub and um another option\nThere is a product called ACT cleaners\nI usually recommend it on a petroleum based stains like motor oil greasy any freeze that type of thing ACT was actually invented in the oil fields in Oklahoma and this cleans machinery it's actually an enzyme it's a powder\nYou sprinkle it over the grease thing and it does work on on Greece from meat so that's why I asked\n'em so somebody had like a ... or a concrete patio and the Greece can on their gas grill spilled um you can take this ACT cleaner sprinkle it on there it goes on it's a white powder and you just leave it alone you don't touch it\nAnd it might take three days it might take two weeks but that enzyme will actually eat that Greece out of that concrete\nAnd the white powder will just disappear also\nAnd um you know or you can get that only on the Internet and its ACT cleaners dot com um but that's an option not cheap but it's a it's a wonderful product for getting rid of any type of grease stains on concrete or would surfaces\nArt

big of a deal to do and it'll look so much better\nSo I'm all about easy I think that yes easy uneasy project yes\nBut since I had you on and says it is a project of the week\nWe have other things that we have to address or crushed or right yes go ahead there is\nA lot of stuff in the car and with the grey and it was a time of year to do it\nIt is yeah you want to make sure that your garage doors working right so a washing waxing that's a good first step I'm making sure that the weather seal uh that's the seal on the bottom than not just the concrete isn't good working water it's one piece\nUm that's going to keep the water out the wind out that sort of thing um and then\nYou know if your door isn't real dire need of help it's okay to replace that we encourage\nThat so yeah I got some good products out there and some may I won't have to clean there you go to I mean it's still got a lot of life in it if it's only Nineteen years old but I'm telling you we have some new designs that are worth now before we get into the\nDesigns Justin let's let's seriously talk about the benefits as we head into the winter months\nI last year I Can't I Can't remember last week besides last winter but I think less where it was kind of chilly we had some pretty cold but I think we got below zero in our neck of the wood days my garage and never got below forty degrees I get the little you know they're starting to come in for temperature never apple forty degrees\nAmazing in in ... you think about well you know my garage what do I care about the temperature in the garage well first off when you get in your car you want it to start up right away do you want it to be ... pipes do you want your pipes to freeze your beer in the ... you know if\nYou're in the garage sale has said on the bottom of sorts of things can happen and those are important things not they have a\nRight so now but in all seriousness the uh uh pipes freezing as a real concern and there's a lot of pine earning garages and if you're having insulated garage door you're going to have far less likely probability of those those guys by many years ago when I was dating my ... my my my my job\nWas to insulate those pipes and that garage was old wooden door and pipes\nRun across the ceiling and man those things would freeze every year we don't really get those daycare\nThen my job was to fall so now that I was thinking when you're talking now is probably not even a problem if you had a really good insulated ... is it different qualities of ... there are\nA yeah you can get a a ... that's the same type of insulation and having those uh phone cuts might use guy and then there's polyurethane orange ... that's the big one yes aren't tele core garage doors used that polyurethane a phone and what that does that gets in all the nooks and crannies and it's\nIt's a higher our values so it's a it's going to keep\nThe cold out the warm in better than anything so yeah that's our and until the court product line and it's going to be the top of the line when it comes to insulation\nWe always talk about the beauty adores would ears are but the real bones how effective it is and how warm it keeps your garage which in effect with and keep your house that worm that really plays that's that's a that's a key if somebody is an old steel ... or ... would door\nRight yeah it's not I mean having the ... the base of a quality insulated product is important and then the aesthetics for sure is something that we uh we definitely focus\nI had a one or you're a big dealers or bill every door on last Saturday and we're talking about yeah we're talking about getting that door ready for winter doors breaking January\nMan yeah you know one thing people don't realize is um springs need to be replaced it's you know cars when they you know there are certain things that you need to do every so many miles ending replacements one of those things too so in the winter\nAs the metal gets more brittle because it's cold um that's when things like that can wear out and that's that's something I Know a bill Weber and his team to like a job or placing those uh those springs when there's issues there and that's something that you want to watch out\nFor so find a good good door contractor and let them do one so we're going in the winter\nNo doubt the key is to find a a reputable dealer or a ... there is as good as they come for sure [noise]\nUm but if you're in a different part of the country what you want to do is you want to find someone\nThat is on the you know a better Business Bureau or another thing to consider is an ID A member that's our industry so that our industry as I'm backing them um and you can also go to co pay\nA door dot com and you can find a dealer on our list yeah and then you can you know anyone that we have out there would be a good deal as well but that's you wanna make sure you find someone that's not just driving around saying yeah I can fix that do you want
