W E K yes [noise]\n\n\nIs not there encouraging it Mazie Hirono was out there in your what Mazie Hirono Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because they're white racist white supremacist totally totally justified\nSo there's a part of me that knows that Democrats are promoting this there's another part I think some Democrats do not think that this dirt range psychological upset\nIs tied to them\n... let me put it this way if we had people on our side behaving like this it would worry me that it would worry me to death that voters are going to think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this the Democrats don't seem to be concerned about that at all some of them like Nate Silver here don't even think\nThat that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats\nAnd I I Wonder if that's true and if it is true how can they be so up to ... if it isn't true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it then the question becomes this\nWhen you get into turn out for the November elections in the midterms by what people are now saying Mr certainly\n... the Democrats some of the people on TV are saying well I I don't think that we know yet what issues are going to determine the vote in the bed [laughter]\nWondering where they heard that I Wonder where they heard that idea of what\nWe don't know yet of the issues are actually going to determine turn out and vote of happened yet they're still among the oh it for the midterm elections\nIt is a interesting question though will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides of this and that's ... ...\nThe Democrats' side it's not gonna fade away and I think everybody needs to notice on the Democratic side this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of today's Democratic Party and the American left\nYou have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of two\nThousand six team they have been mad in saying crazy percolating\nCompounding come pressing all of this ever since then they haven't been ... loaded for bear ever since election day and the day after a two thousand sixteen\nThen this Kavanaugh's situation comes up and I don't think on the Democrats' side they can get any more hysterical\nAnd I don't think they can get any more motivated than they are I think they're at their peak right now\n\nI mean they're still talking about investigating Kevin offered her pulse he wants to see the F. B.\nI. documents released she wants a full\nFledged investigation of Kevin all the Democrats are fucking talking about Gerald ...\nHouse Judiciary committee ranking\nMember of the Democrats promising if the Democrats win the house that they're going to impeach cabin or they're going to investigate him getting thrown off the\nCourt\nThey're not they're not going to let this side this cabinet thing is not over and they're going to continue to rile their side up and motivate them and encourage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience\nAlthough it's more than that it is it is genuine child like I don't even tried like ... ... we're just we're dealing with a complete emotional breakdown\nAnd a group of people I don't care whether to pay it or not folks I that I don't I don't want to fall back on that suggested this anger they feel is not legitimate it's legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm democratic voters is less\nThan what we think it is just because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff I don't I don't think that they would sit around and do nothing in twiddling their thumbs all weekend long if they weren't being paid I think the demographic rages real and it's been real since election night\nTwo thousand sixteen they thought they are going to win that aren't going to win at all and so they haven't been able to come to grips with that even now the capital of the thing is just further evidence that the election and consequences\nThey censor themselves losing control and losing and losing and they can't deal with it they simply cannot deal with it rather than do what's necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning\nEnterprise they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it\nRather than do what's necessary to reach a broad swath of the majority of the American people which they cannot do in their current makeup which is why\nI ask over and over if the Democrats ab large elected Democrats really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them\nAnd when these are mad insane the gusting Democrat protesters and they are identified with the Democrat Party and I don't know if some elected Democrats really get that I give me all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer\nTo the to the truth than not [noise] but for those that don't get it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party\nHave large here's Jake Christian Adams writing is PJ Media Kavanaugh foes fills Senate gallery was sounds of the insane\nSo but there's any doubt that the opposition to Kevin always on hinged on civil disruptive Rudin borderline nuts my experience in the gallery made it clear I have visited this is Chris Adams writing I visited hospitals for the seriously\nMentally ill endless shrieks from this woman in the Senate gallery whereas off and on earth way it has anything I ever heard in ... and a mental hospital they echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery and decreasing the stunning with dude\nAnd then the role was called and it sounded like the gates of hell opened up nearly a dozen women erupted in unison shouting how willing screaming\nIn an unrecognizable venomous whale and they wouldn't stop this was fury was rage was hate it was poisons in the noise\nThey were the sounds of a group of people tinkering with this court ... madness and they were the sounds of irrational on their hands down on more word limit lunatics\nThese were the people who oppose Kavanaugh's nomination they weren't an embarrassment to themselves\nAnd their rights pay attention that's what the left sounds like yeah it is in the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least\nBit concerned about it the Democratic party doesn't seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it the Democratic party at large doesn't seem to worry at all that this\nKind of discord madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections\nIn fact they may think the opposite they may think that this is what's going to further inspire more discordant madness which will result in massive turnout\nThey believe it's going to frighten Republicans in tune not confronting them and basically letting them have their way because who wants to deal with lunatics\nEmpty and same face to face but what it means to me is I don't know that they can get\nMore rapid\nI don't know that there's anything else it can happen to get the more

the Democratic party cried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActing on concerned on an interest in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies these Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything\nHe's or just ... rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population this is what they all said that every Trump rally privately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing because\nThere's not a one of them on the Democrats' side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing

elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those\nThey were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy envy\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand

last caller Sean from Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline\nFrom political Josh just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this okay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine feet firmly order wing\nDemocrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams there's a number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nTo nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I'm exist if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a wipe out the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have any inside the information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans and I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington ... buy that stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to print nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an Alan ... sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or a new meaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nIt can you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters so so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to\nGo out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country despise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election\nNight through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump but the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well\nAs I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take [noise]\nAll snugly said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us ...\nAnd I think and and uh\nThe show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nThe making of a murderer type series to explain how capital beat back her charges and scarred and ruined her for the rest of her life and all of that we're just seeing the beginning here of the rehabilitation of balls the Ford\nAnd it starts with professor whole rehabbing balls the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill whole writes we live in a society that does not believe women\n\nThe many indignities that women experience of their day to day lives is proof of this as is the continued attacks on Dr Balt the board after her testimony that had no evidence and corroborating witnesses\nWe know that people who are survivors of sexual assault that did not happen do not experience justice for their trauma\nWe know that many of them choose not to report to the police and choose not to reveal their assault because they have no evidence or corroborating witnesses and the fear they will not be believed\nSpeaking of which grab audio somebody number ... teams Sally Quinn\nShe is the widow of the late ... editor of the Washington Post Ben Bradlee Sally Quinn used to be a journalist with the Washington Post CBS the CBS in the morning show she\nProbably best known for throwing Washington's best dinner parties during Democrat presidency's\nDuring Republican Presidents Day is nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John Powell that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently [noise]\nDon Juan running around the Senate just that everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally I remember one of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend them while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a [noise]\nSam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower I knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only but\nI'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture that guy put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here to show you on the digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n[noise] [noise]\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of hard to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she asserts that happen in a cab that John Powell tried to sexually assault you in the\nBack of a tax that you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was a nominated the guy for secretary of defense\nAnd that's when all this came out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything he drag\nNow what are the nightclub and order brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me and basically I tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator a stop and\nI was living at Fort Myer Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and the cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon centers screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are very\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn or assaulted by John Tower\nUm\nBut but you know she doesn't want to hear yeah there's one more

white vote has only then won twice they don't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again\nFrom about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor of CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night and the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana unimportant it saddens me because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at the judicial system has been viewed by do as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton and the rest of the Democrats as your private\nRefuge you have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you've probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take\nCases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions\nRoe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because\nOur judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ... B. S. not by you in fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we had political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each\nOther Hillary Clinton well certainly\nI Would love to see us returned to civility Christian I'm a poor listening to one another working on our differences but that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration\nShouldn't we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's if it's a time for instability and is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe a Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton or just Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrat shoved announced they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage road by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThen the president announces he's going to have lunch with Kanye West than the oval office tomorrow what happens next Mr Jay Z and Mrs Jay Z Beyonce come out and denounce cognac\nEnd and Kamkar dash and a two for they denounce ... and his wife Kamkar dashing meanwhile Taylor Swift host some music award show last night nobody watched it the ratings plummeted or an all time low\nSo how can it be that Taylor Swift sponsored inspired massive\nVoter registration drive after criticizing a Democrat or Republican Senate candidate in\nTennessee now where is this massive belief and supportive he's got this popularity and people can't wait to do what she says and express their support in why didn't the same people turn on and watch her show\nThat we're not supposed to ask the question to different things Russia camp extrapolate to voter registration drives an audiences for award show I can you people can make it up left and right I can draw on my own analogies I can ask these questions\nI'm happy to hear you say out there but that this stuff doesn't um intimidate you I think I think it has an\nIntimidated average of Republican voters in a long time elected Republicans are a bit of a different story Dennis in a ... great to have you or how you doing\nGood well thank you long time listener first time caller thank you so it was just a wanting to comment on on the Hillary thing as I listened to do it last night I Can't quote it exactly but\nShe said if you disagree or if if the party is destroying the things you believe in a love letter you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of her\nShort would sure if that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]
