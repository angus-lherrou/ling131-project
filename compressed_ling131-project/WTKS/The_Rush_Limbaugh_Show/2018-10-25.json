just simply because she's on the\nOn the left now before we go to the break we're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears river just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbite that you just heard\nAnd I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase thick and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN doesn't matter they interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nDeal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go I Phil Donahue used to do is all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's worth the difference it made for me it if they started a stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world at as though being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer to the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around on the
