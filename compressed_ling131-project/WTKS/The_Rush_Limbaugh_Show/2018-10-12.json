Miller is no radio station in Savannah has this super stars we do from rush to how did he come back ... news radio Ninety seven point seven W T chaos\nGland fat [noise] done [noise] I'll talk to you later [noise] flown\nTo the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating is that really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his ... you know really walk through the fire for his principles um and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump someone from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a ... will it really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I mentioned I don't know if I mentioned is off the air but there's a certain the New York times today doesn't the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high now they aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kick the Michael ... when they go a low I say hit back harder um Hillary Clinton a you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\n'em when we when that's when civility concert again um there was another ... a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they said they were in the new democratic ... what's the difference between\nThat and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back twice as hard\nWell I mean I I you know that they this what they're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not selling themselves as the new Donald Trump's ... they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw out of all of the Democrats who came out and said holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized trained but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service to civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to ...\nWhat made them almost unbeatable was for the average\nPerson right they they won twice based on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat justice hard nose they at least tried to hide it\nThis switch is now overt we are harassed Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nParty and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders because they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king\nYeah that was really the ... that was his Vail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X. things might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nYou back very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean\nPeople want they don't want to think of themselves as you know as you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the alt right for example if you will you'll hear from conservative it's about the alt right generally speaking\nIs either they're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people are like you know what the alt right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the van and what's the one who said that that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews in blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville right yeah yeah and everyone would ... say that that is her effect um but you know the mother was over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there were ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bomb and was going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\n[laughter] they just won't recognize it uh and\nYou know who on the left standing up against that\nWho

reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening to light it probably has opened in some cities all reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer\n... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia and got away with the wanting to murder of\nThousands nobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys now\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and Marcy on hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance it how do you get it may be and how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits of thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine\nBut they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of karma guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating a PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of hardly any\nAbhorrent Gore and\nViolence in the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nA mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did Kermit guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh from even and this trial that was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this and I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your a moving target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so when I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy you as a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story\nItself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of\nCourse the left abortion is not even human and viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got stars\nPeople that you know people who put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain has won\nThe uh the actor who plays a God sell himself as a as an actor in a I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\n\nOf a job it's probably the finest role that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking\nOurs here so you're not gonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story about the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and star even Searcy or directing\nThe film [noise] uh [noise]\nEven though Trump\nWas initially very hard on Saudi Arabia claiming if this happened and if it was proven this is very very bad we're not going to look the other way well here's the development of and this was this [noise] this is one of the things I shoot myself I should figure to wait for not having predicted this yesterday when I told you the story [noise]\nWe have a tweet here from a guy named Daniel Klaidman now he's the editor in chief at Yahoo\nYahoo News here's his tweets\nA close friend of Washington Post columnist Jamal ... tells Michael

buried in a plot of grass in the console the back yard and the console is not leaving\nWhen the concert was their Turkish officials cannot get in and\nSearch or to dig up you know the old diplomatic immunity thing\nSo now Yahoo News the American media\nIs attempting here to blame Donald Trump is Donald Trump and his open disdain and criticism of the media\nIs said to have made Mohammed bin Salman comfortable with the fact that he can get away with murder and journalist because Donald Trump made him think it'd be okay this is what the American media is now [noise]\nBeginning district you know this was just a tweet from a Yahoo guy holding cough but this don't be surprised\nIf this starts blowing up [noise]\nFrom this point forward right\nNow [noise]\nTalk to some Chris foster plans for a

sixty five months before we get back to the phones one quick\nThing there's a an NBC opinion piece that uh has appeared in opposition to the guys know movie\nAnd here's the headline with his face legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause now movie which inadvertently shows the dystopia of a post row America\nSo whereas we have a bunch of journalists trying to blame Donald Trump for inspiring\nMohammed been so long to murder a soda a Saudi journalist\nNow we have this enemy CPAs which is basically saying\nThat what this movie is inadvertently showing is what will happen if abortion ever becomes illegal\nI was like God's noble springing up everywhere that guys now could\nNot have big calm the mass murderer he became\n\nIf abortion would have been legal which is a crock he did his monitoring after abortion it become illegal\nBut they're trying to say everybody you know you better you better not get what you wish for here because if you if you ever get abortion we have a roe versus Wade overturned you're going to have people like guys know popping up left and right which misses the entire point of this movie\n\nBut that's not a surprise at opponents would try to miss cast what's going on with this tweet saying that the\nCrown prince may have felt embolden by Trump's anti media rhetoric to murder a journalist [noise] yeah that happens in this country right we have a history of murdering journalist Donald Trump got that it was the first\nWas the first hurdle is the Trump a quarter to be killed so they come and tell me [noise] is irresponsible jackass is
