again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon ... women says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight formal\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what what is your reaction to this I mean this is the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned as white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been to transform America away from the\nTraditions institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary and evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan an immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more ground than that in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood and to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice\nHow quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they eat or love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it that's in raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said let's to Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter\nAre the Republicans in that group look at the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders had been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense welfare cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrats

was\nGreat long to hear it again someday but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline that went down two days ago and I recall the last plane went down in Malaysia\nCNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that\nWent that yeah where did I go down\nIn ... Taiwan there about a hundred and eighty nine people\nDied it was a brand new I Believe is following I'm not exactly sure well there's no way to link it to Trump good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking\nThat hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they want in the mid term elections\nDon't worry they'll get to it when they decided nighttime to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it\nYou do you you you new new doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh I just don't ever remember seeing them go on Wall to wall on that last plane that went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN neighbors there were there was they were sucking hot or they were in last place out there\nAnd uh this was that was pre Trump and the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is light blue eye balls are below the TV so they believe and then he had a mystery where it is a damn thing\nWhere is it Don Lemon even ask the former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\n... percent we remember that and I'm surprised okay so ... ... ...\nThey had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything or do any success\nIs to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlet whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what a what ... wait a minute how do you know about it then\nWell I saw a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning Monday morning the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call that program is what I just\nWanted to kill your that that was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to kill him that many people especially it was a brand new planning that I don't\nKnow whether you such a brand new playing what kind of play it was he says about what will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be limited dom somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news there's still a brand new plan going on is unusual and ah we went out\nTo the sea salt in it I'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest um upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body and not as widely\nCourses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ends of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down but\nIt didn't go down in America a Donald Trump has nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... or so\nThere's no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about ... why\nIs that why is it why isn't it a problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation was we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it which is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway as a great piece today [noise]\nSpeaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats questioning Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls e forward with her allegations that whatever capital I did that led to the fact that Kevin all the spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any\nBut the media and the Democratic party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin all was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named in the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... got the confirmation vote and isn't sworn in why did the media drop it if\nKavanaugh was such a rotten S.

this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much closer to my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the recession was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my class cause courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history but the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nBut most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our our ... come on in the way the Democrats want it now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship\nEspecially looking after I used to take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship Dr performed his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because to ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that could not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you realize\nThat the what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story I'm sure\nThey probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who couldn't work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets\nThen I heard the streets were paper with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we will have a lot of little buddy not true I have a nine year old grandson and I just shut it to think about kind of history he's going to be learning it's um\nI don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books\nOh wow you know very one it's hard\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it he's not going to learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know John Silver Boston University at Boston University way back in the nineties did a survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph\nIn reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in and American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard\nZinn as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold the vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about elevated Ellis I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country boom and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth\nAnd it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness we we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design\nBut more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nAdd to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nWhen apple announced that the new ... book air is made of one hundred percent recycled\nAluminum the young people in that\nIn that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's over\nThe environmentalist wackos what this age group have one more than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled\nIt just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nA way for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed into propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\nHoly smokes now let's go to the audio sound like this this folks I\nTalked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history president was greeted by a hundred protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome and told him to stop what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not support what one does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not have come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center President Trump first lady\nIf Monica Trump Jared Kushner walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue shit like\nThat\n\nNow they can reach shake your

is you're not going to see this anywhere I mentioned it to you in the opening our of the program it this is what happened\nThere are thousands of people already in line in Fort Myers awaiting a Trump rally there later tonight [noise] but nobody wants Donald Trump anywhere she everybody hates ... everybody's spices drop everybody regrets that they voted for everybody can't wait\nTo vote for Democrats so the Trump can't do anything you know everybody wants the Democrats back in power so they can start investigating Trump and get rid of it that your drive by media\n\nThey don't show you the reaction of real people you will not see those videos you will not hear that audio anywhere\nElse in the ... one talk radio personality appalled by Rush Limbaugh muggy like be\nRainy or Ninety

do it a month ago CNN declared the Democrats have won the house because of one of their falls Nancy Pelosi is declaring victory in the battle of the house\nShe was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said is real today we were when but what I'm saying now is we will when we when we will win the house\nNancy Pelosi\nPredicting the house that was already been won by the diver so no need for Democrats to vote\nNo on do you think that most of the worst um WTO sees much the ... the ... office was investigating a\nDouble shooting guard ladies island along humans drive the level of one man dead in one injured last night so far no arrests have been made vice president Mike Pence will be up to savannah international trading convention center tomorrow to campaign for Republican Brian Kemp for governor\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump has done that that's what conservatism was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show you count was\nIn two thousand ten when the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something odd um he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when that happened you should've seen in if you remember the bottom fell out when they just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought everybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so there are examples even when people are dams certain\nWhat's gonna happen they ended up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here a piece from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their poll analysts and data at all is there is Sean ... day\nI'm not going to read the whole thing it printed out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch\nAnd I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is and how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a bunch of polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says in the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't\nBother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here is the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know those are my words and on this trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers this adds up to a situation where a slight break\nIn the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait\nHe's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on this trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... ... to be can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec uh in New York's twenty second congressional\nIt was a strict Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burgers how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been a massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this will be enough to flip the majority but Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into way closer than expected seek but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't on the state\nAnd then the next ... are we're relying too much on one pollster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over\nBut yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this\nDay largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so it wasn't going to the polls\nBut here at the end of this four page story what else\nIs working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realize that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices regardless of whether that happens\nWe are well set up for such as eventuality bottom line I happen to live this idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this guy is one of the best recognized as one of the best one of the most respected real clear politics no idea no idea but dressing up with as much intelligence in analysis you can muster with what you do
