T. E. or cellular signals two years ago\nWhen apple in well actually at fourteen months when apple introduced the series three watched they activated L T E cellular service which for the first time made the watch independent of the phone you could\nTake it out of work out you could do anything you can take it away from the phone and have it operate it would still get emails and messages and they're recording your workout data and so forth if you could receive a self like we didn't need your phone nearby\nSo it was the first time that the the watch\nFailed to be doing just ceased to be a slave to the phone\nThe other two ways or blow to and wife ...\nThose are the three ways that day they can get to watch and data can leave a watch you take out he out of the mix because it doesn't exist in Turkey there there there's no watch no apple watching the world and that it's an apple watch they claim he was wearing\nThe story is that his fiance has his phone out in the car in the parking lot at the consulate there was only one way that watch could communicate with that phone while there's two ways there'd be why and\nBlow to blow to if you have to blow to this week by design it doesn't have much range sixty feet max\nYou get into an embassy the shielding the ... are the protections against other nations being able\nTo monitor and over here and steal signal there's no way that the Bluetooth component of a watch\nWould be able to permeate the protections that an embassy would have to protect itself from just that there's ... that couldn't happen so the only other way would be why\nBut that would only work if the wife fine network password of the embassy or consulate had been injured and the wife I connection on one\nJust because the phone connects to why when the phone does the watch automatically connects but not the wife I can next to the phone it's a slave to the phone now if the watch knows why fight network because of the phone it's parents who uses it\nThen like if you're at home or your ... your your phone is inside you have to go outside to walk the dogs you'll come back to the wife I network on your property even if your phones out of range\nIf you've entered the password to the wife I network on your watch as well as on your phone I just don't think she'll be did that like he was probably know to do it um\nI don't know that they would give them the password how'd he get the password of the Saudi Saudi console the wife like the idea that that watch was recording whatever happened to your show and then somehow transmitted up the cloud\nIs just so outside the realm of possibility has to be next to impossible and yet somebody is still pushing this there are still\nThat that recording existed it somewhere in why fire iCloud into Turkish officials are doing everything they can\nThe fed focus their thoughts on two main concepts one being the long term federal funds rate and when there are no longer in an accommodate of posture given the lack of precision and these numbers the fed opted to remove the word accommodate of from the press release about rape that being said they view conditions in economy as a combination for growth\nAnd should expect that growth to continue for some time into the future a couple of fed governors expressed concern for the economy to overheat requiring the fed to take a more restrictive policy stance secondly the u._k. is prime minister met with either leaders and another attempt to set the final plans for the u._k. exit from the European Union\nUnfortunately this meeting ended in another stalemate further concerns without a follow up meeting has not been set despite the u._k. ... at the end of march\nNearly five months from now last week trade tensions continue to weigh on the markets the latest step in the saga has been the U.S has withdrawn from the international postal treaty historically this treaty is offered this kind of postal rates for developing nations to ship small package good but China identified as a developing nation this treaty benefit of the country with lower global shipping rates\nThe U.S his departure from the treaty could result in a significant rise in the cost of small shipments from China to the U.

whatever [noise]\nSo I Want to show you something of a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses and so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting a yard signs that remember\nWe had a call here I just maybe three weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia\nI'm worried I'm not seeing any yard signs we saw Trump's yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nI said well that camp that camp that says it looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened\nAlso includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs and that's\nWhy yard signs of not being put out I I just part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that storm the beaches of Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left or crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way so\nI have a video taken by Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on the digital camera so I put it\nTook a still shot that would have papa pop up here just second this picture you're going to see us from a video taken by cruise worker who was putting up crews campaign

infested rock and roll type you can see that and he's a he's wearing mustard yellow slacks you don't see that in the steel shop here [noise] but\nMad aspects\nOf today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why even knew what what's the purpose of this piece the left turns not delusions they want you to know they want\nReaders to do this left turn is by golly by gosh for real\nSuddenly had like many overnight sensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties in the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past Eighteen years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and soul the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified the liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democrat Party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and for ... odd [noise] I'm On the ... the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical left is now I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen they share a democratic voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent\nThat here we go not this is a long piece but this next graph assist them money graph\nReady well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this site simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross white liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\nA minute into those are the level of white working class was told to go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is at a record high\nFor Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not been growing anywhere near the rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly\nTo the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nInfectious Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some of the social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\n\nWasting a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did so who is who is white\nWomen making up the majority of Democrats

I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help Democrats get votes\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up\nFrom Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico right before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying for this somebody\nThey have to eat they have to be drinking thing we've got to be using\nFacilities somebody\nHas to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who thinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help the this is what got Donald Trump elected this is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion\nAt the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop\nSo what's the calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation may well be\nThat there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick there has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidents of violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse\nAnd maybe start in by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the if that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see\nOther than just the general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump that Trump work there are none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans of the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow them is why they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones got time to work some in here to make up for the first hour where we didn't get any in and this is Andrew in Cleveland thank you for waiting so you're up next\nThat afternoon rush hey I'm\nAs for the

you I should call your call you will finally I got through rush my my point is all these illegals coming up in South America nobody's talking about the fact of the diseases they bring along with them since they're not immunized\nAnd if you've been law reform reports recently yeah the new diseases out called not a new disease is a disease out this has been out for ... and it's a polio like oh yeah it's the same length and also killing American children\nBack twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen hours out free ... let me say that the CDC right as of now has not said they're not sure where it came from yeah twenty fourteen twenty sixteen we had a similar outbreak yeah\nAnd I'm I live in a tough time finding the bleak side of the Internet 'cause it's just if you get these scrubbed on January fourth to twenty six key on a website called natural news the headline read\nTarot virus the sixty eight linked to illegal immigration behind fatal polio like illness killing America's Choice right right right now\nThe CDC is not coming out and people aren't coming out because it leads to much created to Trump's off for a walk\nIf somebody was actually telling you the truth and the drive by media don't you think that this would have some effect on those moms with small children [noise]\nUh yeah I Do I this is another really good point the news it's\nIt's amazing how these things remain isolated we are here in the midst of an invasion of\nPeople from various backgrounds from various countries in Central America and South America\nAnd just independently and some days separation of part there's a story of a shockingly unforeseen increase any polio cases in the United states\nAnd the stories feature medical professionals who are stumped they can't figure out why this really happening\nThey they they can't they can't even make educated guesses as to what might be the origins of this\nAnd then a couple of days go by and there's another story of a mass numbers of people from various parts of the country a world South America Central America there's no question these things are related well I said there's no question common sense tells you there's\nYou're you're absolutely right there cannot be any official ... if you have the CDC or anybody else establishments the fact that the new cases of polio\nWe'll get a chance to make a determination with respect to the credibility and the work that went into that whether it's really accurate fair transparent and the very way that they made it personal commitment to me and uh the ground for it's also made a personal commitment to the president when he spoke to him\n... show you've lived in Virginia and insider attack\nIn Afghanistan officials say St top Afghan officials had dead killed by that ran God's

I have a different theory and what is going on and why they're waiting I don't think they're ... they're not action and all I think if the Democrats for somehow take the house that\nMore will have a scathing report if the Republicans hold it\nLowers report will be much of nothing\nThat's really suspicious of you I mean what do you think of the institutions have your government that there's this big long report that just waiting to be written based on the outcome of the electorate\nWell I think they're already written and I just I think he's waiting to see which one is you've got to re release\nAll you think they're um you know you think they're both written in just determines the election I come to terms which one he turns in\nAbsolutely more just swap [laughter] well all he he is absolutely everything he's there to protect the ... that's ... that's the only\nReason not just a Clinton things that are protect everybody is there to get everybody yeah\nI'm\nOn Russia's been such an honor to listen to you for twenty seven\nYear wait a minute I Need to ask you a question if I knew I was given that if you're if you if you think that Mahler is report\nWill the substance of it will be determined by the election outcome why wouldn't Mahler just just writes that Trump did it why ... why wouldn't he just said that they've found reasonable suggestions that there was inappropriate contact between\nRussia and the Trump get what do they can prove it or not why not just do that I mean if there is certainly this this honest which we know they are if they\nIf the ... the idea that one of them are dishonest yeah the idea that we're going to get an honest subset of reports from this Munch\nWhich is ignoring the real criminality criminal activity which is Hillary Clinton at whole apparatus that created that dot C. A. and then tried to convert of legitimate intelligence to get buys a warrant to spy on Trump expecting honesty out of this lunch\nYou know we don't expect honesty and the reason he's waiting she needs the Democratic party to back up his reports\nMother does mother needs Democrats back back up these reports meaning they if they win the majority of my house than they could back up a report exactly what otherwise but what if they don't win the Senate one for Republicans hold the Senate and even even gain ground there\nWell he just he just can't release anything that way because there is no evidence and if the Democrats somehow when the house he he's got I have a report that's going to be ... to the president if they don't really want hear much on them all\nAnd I look I I understand your thinking on this but I think the report is going to be scaling regardless\nAnd I think it's going to be gay and being in terms of the judge mental innuendo\nI don't believe that won't be any evidence of collusion because we know that it didn't happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "18"}
