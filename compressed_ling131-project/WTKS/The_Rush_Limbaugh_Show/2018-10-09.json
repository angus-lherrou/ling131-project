on America's college campus well tracing where it started let me get back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point would be the most compelling I think the best way to get people's attention or whether it's because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born\nOr and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this I\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate\nAnd not even worthy of discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept\nNone of

everything that we are up against the absence of a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kevin always guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up\nWith this then that's what we'll do\nIt has
