premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds\nAnd the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this up ever gets\nIts why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stopped in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[noise] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and it's so predictable because they hate the

just see those are the old rules in Washington people under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to not make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\n\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it\nAnd you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he spoke just sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was smeared and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just this is just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined and he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump did not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up for us today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rushed pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nI can tell you the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down toward\nThis thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have but Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop that's what we need more gun control\nI mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control law cancer not putting someone with a gun that can stop this\nWell look I hate to be the ones who tells you but uh there's no amount of death\nThere's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you see it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have it's about it's about\nTelling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east or because of it but but but but we're all for freedom as we define it he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with the Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board Airforce one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit seem\nSo a guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first question\nA drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws\nBy the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things [noise] anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd they tell you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nUntil retailer started calling them silent crime it's why people have life like have life

Obama what's their guy Obama was who they think they are right ... well spoken highly educated reasonable academic intellectual\nUm and in look in the leftist world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama for hanging around the anti Semite like Farrakhan agenda Robert Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks to feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with slavery discrimination and all that could have said that that really we we we can't hold them accountable we may have excuses you know we can look the other way\nNot exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was a con standing right next to them all up to read the Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him and many drive by news organizations cropped Farrah Khan out of the photo\nWhen they sent it down their news wires so they know but it's ... this is the point we have a two tiered justice

'cause if their entire religion\nThat's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform of orthodox and and the other branches how\nMany different flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheism I Need the the third anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing seeing Islam\nBut I you know but I Do the it's a it's a ... pie\nThat's exactly right but this is where Mrs all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no\nUltimate power that can meet out approve or disapprove of ones that's been one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh\nGiven everything else that you say that you are the old the liberalism to creep in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism your writers it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so\nThis event in Pittsburgh did it did it adds to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\n[noise] ah it doesn't I I I don't I don't feel like\nThat there's a million people out there are targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go she got the thing is I think that this is these are isolated incidents in this country because the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nUm I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI'm Glad you said because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much Rachel I prefer this racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this year I put my hands\nTogether and look to the lord to do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk and his pipe bombs none of ... what do you think\nThe odds are to the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded to the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure\nToo unhappy about that [noise] and then the second event happened\nOn Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different fits why I did the show opened today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact I think the media\nTheir natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since Sunday shows yesterday with is the attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping the influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and there but I this is ed this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the\nPresident what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible\nAnd what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing the solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the ... going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place to ... says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea\nThat Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House that's how they want to use it that's what its purpose is\nSave touch a license number L BA for one eight eight for breaking news when it\nHere we go soundbites eighty eight and nine just illustrate what happened on ABC yesterday here is stepping up\nAcross social media speech and anti Semitism are

be established something they cannot be proven but yet there are news reported\nAs fact gleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] [noise] you know\nI I don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a columnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the the international\nPolitical expert at what have you and I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me his pieces in advance\nThinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has gone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot [noise]\nAnd now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on there just ripping Trump a new one primarily\nFrom the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior\nAnd his ah come Portman just isn't president control and you know the usual complaint from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed in an echo chamber for rumor and conspiracy theory\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart was says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart the pack\n[noise]\nI maintain view as I said in my opening monologue the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we admire and respect\nUnder attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder\nWherever it happens they are politicizing the whether\nRepublicans have been called murderers by the Democratic party ad willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people

media reporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and are you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I also mentioned in the\nFirst hour that Trump was elected to behave differently\nHe was elected precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understand a little one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers rapists and you just don't talk about him that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about him that way but Trump dead and so they all start laughing I think this guy can't be serious he is not going to last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting\nAnd this guy is not going to last this craziness\nTrump kept slowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable\nA land back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want Trump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nicknames and so forth\nAnd they thought this is to sit this can't happen these camps that you've never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived and then they started the two years silent cool and that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left I'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I\nOr anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he was doing\nIn corrupting the\nHighest levels of our government for the express purpose of overturning an election I don't care how much power I think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done in the past two years including the Mueller investigation including the planting of out right lives five times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof that Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for\nTwo years Mr boot for two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\nThey were hoping and they live with every day with the idea of going to wake up and the the smoking gun was going to fall into their lab but they knew\n\nThat there wasn't any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on\nThe FBI the OJ they knew the tricks being played and they willingly supported those tricks they ignored\nThe real collusion and rigging elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think\nWe've got over here and conservative media we couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice\nAll Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists we no way we wouldn't have the power to plant spies in the campaign of a presidential campaign we opposed\nThere is no way any of us\nCould write up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming that Hillary didn't despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire so warrant\nTo spy on the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media could come close to doing anything\nThat has become\nA natural everyday occurrence on the ... you want to talk about extremism and this this so called magical of delivery to brainwash what\nAre your things happen in the past two years in the mainstream media brainwashing the American people do you do now\n[noise] [noise] [noise] I Want to I Want to I Want to ask a question here when Robert Mueller does not come up with the goods when when it is finally admitted\nOr alleged that Donald Trump did not ... ... with the Russians and he didn't cheat steal the election how many crazies on the left are gonna go bonkers when they hear this meaning how many people in this country to this day at this moment still believe\nThe Trump stole the election he worked with potent and the Russians to do it and it's only a matter of time and why do they think this because the media has assured them that it happened for two years\nWith the

Chesapeake, Virginia Hi\nHi rash what a great honor and privilege as it is to speak with you today thank you very much I\nI just wanted to make a couple additional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yeah now I I normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ACC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they set this neither my wife and a rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this went out with it and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make sense because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive they never worry about where is this going to end\nBut if you were if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim to that all of a sudden my fear where is it leading to where does it it's absurd whereas it had to\nGet my own thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our schools since that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the ... the lessons you we we have gun free zones schools now you can't put guns in their only people get in with guns or the bad guys you people up [noise]\nUm the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow so the gun itself to the left as the problems all the presence of guns mean [noise]\nNah don't make it\nTo some Chris foster made accused of\nMurdering eleven people at a synagogue

that that was the day that we had a we'd learned about the pipe bomb or a seizure say I can his\nPerfectly uh uh [noise]\nBumper sticker van and and all that but I drive by is very very angry at me for pointing out that everything and that man was symmetrical you get in shape and none of it was fated drive by very angry at me for the fact that is\nA point in time I'd ever to overplay that when it first just to illustrate\nA [noise] I I don't think these people understand the extent to which they have a damaged their own credibility\nAt what we we simply don't accept what they say anymore without questioning and they do not get that I think they insist that we accept what they say without question and they've lost that that's that's one of the\nSomewhat say sad things that's happened but that there's this constant doubt so here we have a montage of\nMSNBC yours NBC here is CNN ours and others apoplectic that I dared make any observation about the stickers on the Caesar say ox man\nRush Limbaugh this afternoon talking about how the stickers were to symmetrical on the band Rush Limbaugh\nIs casting doubt on the suspect than\nRush Limbaugh say something like you know what those stickers don't look said it enough\nI don't understand why Rush Limbaugh would say something like that I'm Amazed to hear people talking about this is a false flag operation I'm Talking about

that every one of those bumper sticker or whatever they weren't the cows are perfectly symmetric way placed an ad\nIn the in the windows of the guys than any right up here is what I ... I called my final summation that happened on friday about why we were suspicious of the drive by media and the left in general\nThey have made me suspicious and all of you that attempt this ongoing attempt to destroy Donald Trump to overturn the election results to thousands sixteen and it was codified epitomize if you will in what they tried to Brett Kavanaugh it's no different\nAnd they aren't going to stop I don't need to be told reminded how fit to be tied enraged they are over their failure to get rid of the Trump\nI Know they're psychology I Know these people in the media and I know that these Democrats they are just folks beside themselves that every thing's they've got in their arsenal of weapons hasn't worked\nSo given that this is the sum total of\nIntelligence guided by experience I don't believe\nI'm not gonna believe just because I'm told that something happened the way it did\nAnd that's a shame it's a shame that the highest levels of our government has gotten to the point where this trusting them is a common sense ethical thing to do but they've brought this on\nAll of these nameless faceless anonymous sources with all of this order be as\nEvery day for two years New York times CNN intelligence command resources and former American intelligence officials tell the New York times ... blah blah blah blah blah blah every day sometimes many times a day for a year\nTwo years stuff's\nMade up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixty and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump voters on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise]\nWe have to weigh in it\nAnd told everybody to the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistake they've been telling everybody there's going to be a blue wave it's fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five\nPercent chance two weeks out a bunch of bombs start showing up", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "29"}
