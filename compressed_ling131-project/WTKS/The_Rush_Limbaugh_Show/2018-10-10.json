I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being there so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican\nAnd not for me but it is what it is and they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept\nFor the very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK\nAssassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential elections has Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe ... the left has as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into\nSo that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I\nNot to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and\nThere were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and pledge their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become\nAmericans [noise] and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all well Nineteen sixty\nFive is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here to Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana amount and pour it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nJudicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you\nMrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this\nOutside of Obamacare practically every liberal\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her\nBecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\nHe is not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative Steve college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christie on um on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again missed characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh anyway\nThe upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nIf the party is destroying the things you believe in a love letter you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party as well Republicans conservatives I'm big on civil to the likes of

he just wants to brag he's just doing this for PR no\nFriends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask Larry many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interesting he doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly\nI Believe Donald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not\nConvey proper information about him as his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only are you all rushed but but you are the voice of the mainstream media you should have the best staffing pond yes\nUh should have the ... app and pot [laughter] hey my point is a today a with Hillary's comments that a\n... liberals don't need to be civil too conservative\nOr it reminded me of a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even used it a but here's the quote a society is either moving towards civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the farmers just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society is always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety harbor resume or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle exhort either trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant flocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if a Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards the law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nRight ah with all of their character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh\nAntifa violent shooting\nYeah there's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact in most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all fine and dandy one more day then\nI think it was a before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word I Want not when what were they what were they light when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what what they want but I doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time they see a issue was a labor laws and a win\nFor what purpose\nMy point the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point\nThe Democratic party has always been rooted in the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism\nHas been rooted in pro socialism and big government they've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violet socialism to achieve their means my point they're not\nThat different there just mass getting less today\nYou know read about it in the paper tomorrow Russia I'm lucky I be met work a\nRadio Ninety seven more than\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan he's a healthy guy he's a dad of six and he works as a guide in Alaska and it goes to the doctor a true
