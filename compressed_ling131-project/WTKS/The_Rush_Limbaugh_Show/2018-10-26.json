up\nBut if they don't we take that house\nOnce the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that Feisal document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the I think these package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is of Democrats in the

Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger\nThat at one of their crackpot view or is this going to take action except the theory is crackpot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about\nLetting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places\nAnd these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave and and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that\nIt's it's a one way street with these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it and spout the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see an or find people's data that Trump fires back at them\n\nThat's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back\nFor ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative people\nSpokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\n\nSubway chalk it up where of course yeah he was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to the Trump a lot of people said Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply ... and I'm Talking about who started it I'm Talking about\nThese people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you if you wanted to\nDecorate and dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop this is what you would do\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today as he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this has not\nBeen done before in in this in this manner\nUh [noise] and he is talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you\nThat law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nJob by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of Trump pacing if if you think Trump is not\nAs on point is is your baby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ... foreign showed up\nAt the at the Senate Judiciary hearing what a Trump say I've found her very credible I really hope that she continues to testify I think you know what happened there happened and Kevin are maybe ... that's what he said at the beginning and he did it\nA couple of observations about those two audio somebody's replayed Donald Trump in the White House that I was like three hundred and fifty four hundred\nYoung black leaders from various walks of life in the United states did you hear what happened when the president of the United states praise law enforcement\nFund during applause\nStanding ovation in some parts of the room but some during applause nobody's looking at me and there nobody started booming law enforcement among this group of young conservative black leaders something else in in the remarks made by President Trump is very gracious tort law enforcement\nHe was very gracious toward the work done to bring this vial this gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice and I I think before the day is out you're going to see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge by Trump doing it for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity\nYou might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox\nIn a call trumpet total front calling for unity when he is responsible\nFor all of the chaos and division they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the old Limbaugh the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which for rock Obama\n\nActually got to pretend and portrayed himself as involves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up [noise] um that's the ... the around the Obama effect not respond that's we're going to they're going to accuse Trump [noise]\nBack in a second [noise] this is a Fox\nNews alert and I'm Chris foster a fifty six year old man's been arrested in ... Florida suspected of sending twelve package bombs this week the prominent Democrats or critics of President Trump its name according to sources Caesar say ... it's been arrested before Fox's ... they'll reports about the investigation\nThey had a lot of evidence they had all of these ... and the evidence inside those ... the powder and the pipes that all the pieces of that were used at assemble those devices\nAnd they had the post marks and presumably a lot of video surveillance footage and what I'm told is this individual was in fact known to law enforcement had prior arrests for terrorist threats of former New Yorker who now is living in Florida\nThe FBI is also taking disaster the man's ban its windows are all covered with pictures of President Trump and slogans praising him and criticizing liberal some have targets on their faces [noise]\nThis is a Fox News alert\nPeople come to beyond exceptional dentistry looking for beyond exceptional dentistry and that's just what they find listen\nI Know I found the perfectionist I was looking for things for an exceptional job\nYou also corrected my bike which I didn't even realize needed adjusting I haven't had a headache or nicknames and [noise]\nI live in Canada and my oldest is in Savannah so that's an indication as to the quality of care they offer\nFor beyond exceptional dentistry right here in Savannah called two three four eight to eight to love\nThe best in show Saturday disagree on radio buddy seven points out the cage [noise]\nI'm just to clarify the Limbaugh fear of them was how I explained that the media never held Obama accountable for anything that was going wrong including his own policies and Obama\nWould never even always position himself as an outsider a up against powerful interests that were standing in his way and he was valiantly fighting them meanwhile it was his policies that were growing up\nAnd I ... I marveled at this and how how the relationship to the bottom of the media permitted to him to go through his presidency on accountable and all those lives about Obamacare you keep your doctor keep your plan twenty five hundred dollar per premium decrease every year that kind of thing\nNever called him on it well here's Trump out there and he's acknowledging law enforcement and they're going to call him a total fraud here\nBy trying to say he's free unity when he's that guy they're going to say is responsible for it is not a man\nAnd they'll say that he is bracing just unbelievably brazen for talking about this as if he's not complicit in it that he's\nTrying to stand above it gave Obama the benefit of the doubt on everything but they are going to hold Trump to mark my words [noise] okay for those have you're watching on the digital camera here is a shot that has three windows filled with stickers what in their ...\nAnd his band as is the case with\nAll of these they will eventually be at Rush Limbaugh dot com so everybody can see them you know I could withhold them and have them only for digital camera usage but that that would be cheap ah an ad on necessary [noise] we're just taking advantage or of the tech\nOr being able to use the switch or to show you these things have you looking at big van window there on the left\nOr you will see ... lower center you will see what you may not be able to tell I don't know what size screen you're looking but it's Hillary Clinton in the crosshairs of a rifle scope\nAnd just beneath her as you're looking at this to the left is Michael Moore\nAlso in the crosshairs of a shotgun and then to stickers over from Michael Moore is the CNN sucks\nSticker or whatever but the thing to notice they're three total windows in the van there's no way anybody could see in or out\nOf these one of those days are in the rear by the way they're on the side\nOf the van a you've got parents or the upper left look how evenly proportion every sticker is look at nothing is off line there isn't any overlap\nNothing has been slapped up there in a passion or anger or any of that in either of the three windows that you'll see here\nNo no nothing is David this is South Florida sun this guy's been driving around who knows how long nothing's faded this screams noticed me\nThis this would be the face you got a bunch of people down in South for I don't like Trump they see this band park somewhere and you know if there's somebody would be throwing things on it or scraping it with the kids or gay paintbrush and tomatoes rotten eggs who knows whatever this damaged pristine\nVan is ah is almost like a\nWork of art here is Chris in Las Vegas glad you wait until you're next year on open line\nFriday high but it's there it's an honor and privilege appreciate that serve thank you\nI just wanted to say about the only thing this guy's van was actually meant\nThe worst spotlights on a giant neon sign that said I did it a rest man [noise]\nI [laughter] I don't know [laughter] I mean I Can't stick out any more than it already has\nIt's ridiculous\nYeah we what this guy's apparently about a law enforcement radar for a while uh they're cleaning DNA got some DNA off I guess some of the packages here he's been arrested and and uh on law enforcement radar\nBut you wonder how long this vans been decorated like this how long it's been driving around down there unnoticed are observed or or what have you\nIt does it just I don't know something about this that [noise]\nI don't know I'm like you're watching a hundred percent right so you're a hundred percent right like it looks too good it's been out there in the sun for as long as it has been people in that state openly can despise the president and probably have a long time\nAnd nothing's happened to this guy then it's like somebody just tossed this guy the keys and tell them hang out for twenty minutes the cops will be here you know and then you just take it from there it's like\nHow much more to set up in this book like this they even if this guy who was part of the Republican Party the guy needs help and he doesn't represent anything but a small fraction of some extreme it may not hold a candle to what this party actually is very\nTrue very true goes without saying but I mean you you got me imagining pictures now is van driving around and you see people would notice I mean I I noticed a bumper sticker on a card in front of me if I think it's looney tunes\nIs is this man or\nThere's no way that this man doesn't get noticed it doesn't have people reacting to it in in certain ways so you think what then you you you you think this guy is being used\nYou know I don't know like I mean like it's not there is going to a gym we lose jet and the guy is just off his rocker and he just needed some medical help on on a hobby [laughter] Russia I mean\nWell you don't watch it if he needs medical help he just needs to say is transgender and that'll be the first step\nIn American politics Tom ... got a bomb Tom ... is a California billionaire and they all turn a day of energy bitten is who's ...\nSupporter proponent and propagandist for man made climate change so he got a bomb CNN says and Kamala Harris California got a bomb now here's an unrelated story but\nIs it\nIs John ... reporting for Breitbart we had the news yesterday that Charles

the lunch at a questionable things during the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings apparently [noise] excuse me according to Breitbart NBC News\nLiterally hit the information that would have helped clear Kavanaugh\n\nThat is the headline NBC News here and the information that would have cleared Kavanaugh of the rape allegations being\nMade by ... client apparently she totally recanted her story and NBC no it and didn't report it\nOn September sixteenth cabin on his loved ones were dropped into a pit of hell do the allegations of sexual assault from Christine ball the Ford although her story quickly fell apart during public testimony\nDemocrats in their allies and the establishment media did everything in our power to personally destroy cabinet as a drunken serial rapist\nNBC knows and the ... playing a huge role in this campaign one notable exchange\nWas NBC breathless we publishing an arrogant assault allegation against capital all that was quickly exposes a hoax NBC did not even bother to independently corroborate this allegation proud of airing it a Democrat handed NBC the smear and NBC ran with it this was Kavanaugh's setting up gang rapes\nAt high school and college to make matters worse\nBright Mart says it they now know that NBC News withheld crucial information that undermine the sweat next allegations she again they have an Arctic clients who accused Kavanaugh spiking punch bowls\nAt house party so and he and his buddies could engage in gang rape\nAnd we know that NBC deliberately withheld this crucial information because NBC is now admitting it had the information all the way back on September thirtieth September thirtieth is a week prior to Kavanaugh's confirmation during the most intense days\nOf the scandal when his confirmation was still very much in doubt ah here's what NBC did not want the public to know if you recall although he withheld the name Abu ... tweeted outta sworn statement from a woman who backed up sweat innings outrageous rape allegations in her statement\nThe second woman swore that she too had witness Kavanaugh's fight punch bowls and takes sexual advantage of girls unbeknownst to all of us NBC had interviewed this anonymous witness on September thirtieth and she recanted\nBut only now is NBC News bothering to report\nThis\nQuote referring to Kavanaugh spiking the punch I didn't ever think it was ... the woman said to reporters and a phone interview arranged by ... September thirtieth when asked in the phone interview if she ever witness Kavanaugh act inappropriately toward the girls the woman said no\nOn October third NBC News again spoke to the woman and this time she often accused ... of fabricating her statement\nIt is incorrect that I saw Brett spike the punch I didn't see anybody spike the punch I was very clear with ... from day one that I never saw yet he brought her forward as a witness when pressed about abusive behavior toward girl she wrote in the text I Would not ever allow anybody to be abusive but my presence male or female I didn't\nSee it happen I didn't know what NBC News knowing they withheld it\nUntil after Kavanaugh is confirmed had they\nCome forward with the second witness having been made up rats even lied about what she saw it would've blown the confirmation hearing sky high so this is why people don't trust anymore what comes out of the media when anything related to Donald Trump\nFilled with his own suffering\nAnd so the sense was that the momentum was being lost\nBy Republicans Republican voters the story was that Republican voters were [noise]\n[noise] somehow\nLosing their enthusiasm to I\nKnow what early vote a registered to vote was too late for that but whatever it was ... and now Trump has joined that parade President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent the prominent Democrats lamenting that this scare\nHas distracted from news about the mid terms and even slowed Republican momentum he said Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now there's bombs stuff happens\nAnd the momentum greatly slows\nNews not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that was Trump's tweet\nNow\nThere are some who believe that this was another example of Trump\nPacing just like when he made his original statements about Christine balls the Ford being credible and compelling and then later\nSort of lowered the boom on her at a rally pointing out that she really had no evidence and the way the backup what she was alleging so some people think that he's some during the same thing here uh basically tampering expectations\nWith the bombers suppression state but the trumps out they're lowering expectations setting people up so I asked to be able to say we overcame the bomber and we did great\nAnyway and there's some people think that this was very very artful of Trump that he's getting really really good at this\nLowering expectations while he knows things are going to go well and then when they do go well he can go back and look at what we had to overcome looked at the obstacles that we did it we came through\nAnd we try out so we will see Charlie Kirk a turning point you asked a\nSweet and ah let's see there be yesterday that the presidential approval rating has hit forty seven percent of his highest yet I don't need a despite the poll\nI'll guarantee you it's not a CNN poll and it probably is it an ABC Washington Post poll or even NBC Wall Street Journal maybe Rasmussen\nBut forty seven percent in whatever pull it is is Trump's highest and also forty seven percent is free points higher than Obama's approval rating twenty ten midterms does anybody remember what happened to twenty ten\nMidterms this struggling a little pop quiz on history now admittedly this is eight years ago\nIt seemed like eight years ago that Obama was president mid term but how many seats the Republicans win in the two thousand ten mid term some of the three\nThe Republicans one pick the free now in those terms conventional wisdom one out\nConventional wisdom is the party out of power ... big gains in the house and Senate primarily the house in the first election after a president is inaugurated\nWell that's what we have coming up here but but ... point is that Obama was sitting at forty four forty five percent back then trumpet forty seven percent Adam ...\nAre you saying and therefore we uh we could be looking here at the and a bit of an\nUpset [noise] there's also polling data here in Florida and let me let me find this it is yes your ego\nBarely two days after Democrats Andrew Gillum\nWas leading in most polls for governor of Florida a strategic Research Associates Paul conducted for great TV and released a couple of days ago shows Ron dissent is pulling into the lead forty eight forty five margin of error plus or minus three and a half\nSo statistically tied the poll is the first since the primaries last month to put the Santa Fe head of Bernie Sanders supporter Andrew Gillum\nNow there's all kinds of controversy about Gillum uh caught in this thing operate do I am reading\nBy the way that it is possible that the FBI is going to indict Gillum at some point regardless of the election that he's going to be indicted for some of the corrupt practices have been investigated for\nA we have the news that he had he paid an Under Cover\n...\nThe money to buy handled and tickets in New York\nBeyond that emails in tax raise questions on Gillum Z trips with lobbyist records show Gillum new well in advance that he was out of state meetings with Adam Corey could help him network with power for developers businessmen and the lawyers\nI mean this is incredible at a newspaper is doing investigative journalism on a Democrat but the Miami Herald is\nA it's a it's not so we'll see how that plays out there's a Politico story today I saw it last night that Trump fears a Florida wipe out that Donald Trump fear\nIs that we're going to lose everything in Florida the socialist in Florida are going to win\nEverything and so Trump is scheduling even more rallies and more effort in Florida to try to save the day here it is a political star and that's the word is being used the Trump fears a Florida wipe out\nThere are other news stories that suggest drugs drug has links to them that are the socialists of America\nAppear ready to win and dominate and convert America after long\nLast too committed socialist policies so you find these stories all over the place about the intention of voters this ah this cycle\nAnd how they're faring the Charlie Cook reports\nThe vaunted inside the beltway analysts\nWho take a look at every election inside out with the election just eleven days away now it seems that the overall Senate playing field won't change much although what appears that some of the races in toss up are getting even tighter that says it's\nGetting more difficult to see a path to the majority for Democrats with Democrat US Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nHeading for defeat in North Dakota Democrats now need a net gain of three seats to win the majority the one way would be the whole the five Democrats seats and toss up and pick up three of the four Republican seats in toss up\nIf you read the cook report I'm not going to bother telling you which ones those are but that's how they analyze the bottom lines of this story is that New Jersey has\nBeen moved to toss up in the cook report New Jersey has been moved to toss New Jersey ought to be deadlock Democrat any day of the year that you look at it New Jersey being in in a toss up and Florida\nRemains a coin toss although Democrats see a path to victory for US Senator Bill Nelson well they better\nHe's the incumbent he would have the path to victory in Montana between Jon Tester the incumbent\nAnd state auditor Matt Rosendale that racist tightened tester maintains an advantage that's either just within or just outside the margin of\nError there is in addition to the top ... who's the race in New Jersey moves to toss up from lean Democrat [noise]\nNow all of this movement taking place this week\nIn the midst of the bomb scare on the Republican side Republican district dangerous feel better about us senator Dean Heller is where he is in in Las Vegas strip dangerous also feel better about Martha ... Sally where she is in her race against the\nWell\nGifted in ... I'm gonna with withhold the characterization Tennessee in Texas remain unlikely candidates for the ... column so looking bad for Beto O'Rourke there\nBut the um\nSo is there is a great difference of opinion even among Republicans where the race in Texas between crews and or ... today cruise allies contend that\nHe's way ahead of O'Rourke well outside the margin of error\nBut the cook report people say we are aware of other polling that shows a closer race back to Florida for a moment thirty eight Florida sheriffs are demanding Andrew Gillum withdraw his anti cop pledge\nThirty eight elected Florida sheriff's on Thursday called on Andrew Gillum the gubernatorial candidate here for the Democrats to immediately and Monica quickly withdrawn his support for a radical organization is freedom pledge that refers to anti police rhetoric\nProsecute them him her whoever it may be\nSaid of the law the\nPresident a White House event after the arrest of a man named Cesar ... fifty six years old he has several prior arrests including one for making terroristic threat\nThe arrest comes after the FBI scouring the sprawling nail sorting facility outside Miami, Florida\nWhere several packages or play to pass through Kim more were found this morning one at that Florida facility intended for democratic senator Cory Booker and other was discovered that a post office in New York City intended for former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nThat's Fox is racial Sutherland and this is a Fox News alerts [noise]\nSavannah today and I could with eckerd no science center and I still want to talk about hardwood flooring yes it's still an awesome value addition to your home yes the hardwood flooring project calculator is still up and running a carpet savannah dot com helping a lot of folks understand what a hardwood flooring project price looks like but today\nYou mentioned that not only will we never be be ... or a Home Depot hardwood price but we won't be beat by an online price either if you find\nA lower price on a product we carry then that becomes the price you pay ... honestly we don't run a whole lot of sales and our shop mainly because we keep our eye on the lowest prices that there are out there on line and at the competition shops so we know what those Lewis prices aren't just price the floor accordingly and we've always been a\nFull service shopped we can install everything we sell so from the beginning of the end we can take care of the entire project come take a look we're right behind the green frogs sleep center just off ... and it carpet savannah dot com for everything hardwood\nLynn that money was no difference because of the rating them more than seven point seven double duty chaos [noise]\nSo many emails asking what are you really think Russia and get the sense that you're holding back to that [noise]\nHolding back um um no my friends I'm not holding back I'm waiting\nTo hear what is said and at the upcoming press conference of the media are eagerly anticipating and its upcoming we're seated at the department of justice waiting for whoever's going to conduct this\nTo\nExplain how they found a guy who the guy is if they found anybody else working with\nThe guy ... co conspirators Ira ... is there somebody that has been working on this guy for some period of time inspiring it motivating revenue him up I mean there's so much that we don't know yet\nAnd we don't know what we're going to be told we don't know how credible what we're going to be told is despite all of that there is enough information to glean simply by exposing yourself to that which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democrat Party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years\nOn this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big that is so outrageous what\nHas been done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with Russia Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still\nOngoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this investigation began George ... Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned that\nIn these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Waller\nJust briefly to recall\nPapadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign you never met Trump he never gave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was hounding Trump or your advice virtues obviously goes out these positions\nPapadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph Smith Seward who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lot of Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador is stepping options\nYou know I told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigations they'll get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that my point\nIs how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have and entitlements to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in it to you and I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it if there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years silent who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever find out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had the wit and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do\nAnd I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it I Believe those people are capable of anything to get what they want I have no doubt about it and I'm Sorry it's not my fault for being suspicious", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "26"}
