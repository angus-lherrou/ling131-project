Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression\nOr

little test so Iran are these people at the event last night it's going to\nBe a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red way but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many other committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being chunks you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I said forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre no not as well known that that makes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now has reelect and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip and then you've got a contest among races are in in other parts Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning and members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of them did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit at home they're not going to win all their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking my job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is random wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office watch look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\n... member of my great book great in the presidential\nElection of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained uh in addition to lower Democrat voter\nIntensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPill a movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in\nIn the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive\nBuys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations uh the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it is a problem\n\nThere's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these falls surprises he\nCalls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was ... do we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward\nLarger wider variants than that but that's the overall stat buddy it could well\nBe that the never Trump or is that retired knew they had no prayer anyway in their districts\nAnd so they quote unquote took the high road or the\nStomach Trump chunks of phone I don't I don't want to be part of the potentially split the scene and they're\nReplaced by a ... and Trump supporters so that\nCould end up being a net positive okay when we come back the drive by media all over not blaming me we're back first it was the Oklahoma City bombing\nAnd now me and others in conservative media being

for all this and in due course I mean it's so old it's actually not news anymore and it's\nIt's it's really pathetic of these people on the left I got it all started with me being blamed the Oklahoma

Donald Trump following through\nOne of the primary commitments he made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his illness\nSure and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on

and order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration\nAnd actually both parties have to the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them are both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that and the left wants those changes the left wants this country\nOverthrown from the days of its founding\nOut to the left America's it legitimate to a gym morals it's in decent because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers and their bunch of white privilege rich white guys they set up a country

Scott sanctioned slavery Roger than it was the chief justice for ever immortalized in infamy\nIt held that black slaves were not citizens so Congress got into gear and pass the fourteenth amendment guaranteed that freed\nSlaves would have all the privileges of citizenship by providing quote all persons born or naturalized\nIn the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states added up a state where we may reside which means the draft or is it the fourteenth amendment had no intention of conferring citizenship I'm the children of aliens who happened to be born here in fact\nThe very author of the citizenship clause senator Jake I'm Howard of Michigan\nExpressly said this is why the original intent of founding documents is so important quote this\nMeeting the fourteenth amendment this will not of course include person who was born in the United states who are foreigners who are aliens who belonged to the families of ambassadors or\nForeign ministers it was expressly intended to confer citizenship to slaves and their descendants\nThere was an Eighteen eighty four case elk versus Wilkins Supreme Court ruled the fourteenth amendment did not even can for citizenship on Native Americans because they were subject to tribal jurisdiction not us jurisdiction will an illegal alien here\nIs not subject to us jurisdiction there

you here\nThat could rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of section one an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\n... ... ... it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country and that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens I've told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth unlimited abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves as citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several states ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the those black folks were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment a few a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo ... for citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign\nAgents it was expressly\nWritten chicken first citizenship on slams and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration and you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean never there's always been\nA people being granted citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't have to they they settled in uh in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English and they became part of American culture that ... of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization that's\nWhat's different now there is no interest in that\nWe don't even make a serious effort at a similar lightning we're Balkan icing if they use this term tribal but we're ... our population\nBecause modern arrivals don't all seek\nTo become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are but this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it\nThen for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the synagogue surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we are going to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd

or Hi\nThank you rush and thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ...\nWith the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide\nOh it'll be their language says it'll get there and they'll get their okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah\nLook we're way way far away from this we're just getting on the conversation started here which has to happen\nLimit ... there are a lot of common sense things to do you know certainly the birthright citizenship thing going on with the help and the e verify but this is another thing that would certainly help providing jobs\nThat they would be doing in this country possibly anyway low tech manufacturing that's being done now in China that could certainly be done down there I haven't heard anybody talking about that that is what kind of that was kind of surprised that uh but nobody in the Trump Administration has been mentioned that\n'cause I don't think that's what this is about NAFTA was supposed to do that\nAnd it failed royally uh these people\nIn a caravan are not looking for jobs they're not looking for maybe ... maybe a few of them are but this whole thing is\nPolitical this is a political movement these people\nAre being paid somehow I mean somebody's paying for all of this to happen um there are plenty of places to\n... the only place that can go to the United states that can stop and get asylum in Mexico or some of these other countries\nUh well I I agree with you that if the rest of the world was more like the United states everybody would be better off if the unequal distribution of capitalism could be dealt with and if we had a far greater distribution of capitalism be fine and dandy but the caravan and\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's ... [noise]\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nation as where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\n'cause that's these people aren't capable hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand that if you want to talk of political theory and economic theory it makes sense in the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a shore political movement here this caravan [noise]\nI don't know either George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind but somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize\nThe United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better isn't being done\nDo it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party which wants to welcome these people in\nAs dependent voters a jam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network high\n[noise] Ah yes fresh uh two years ago my husband and I adopted for Hispanics sisters\nWho were in foster care and we had had him for a couple of years and then they cannot fuck option their parents go to Betsy Italy Gulf of Mexico they have slipped over the border at least for high illegal a one party at the end of each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left on my grandparents\nCame back had two more went back and got him a long shot is that even today I had you know they were\nCame to us thanking Trump pushed the horrible and that he would send them all back home and and now they left Trump and they think this has gotta stop and he even said because I saw this in prison for twenty eight year\nOld mother flat but Mexico not of course that's ah so\nWhat kind of awful crimes against their own children and you know I just said\nAnd they can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies and I have another situation I can tell you that way I Know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they let her across they\nSent the other sixteen teams with our back on my stomach so they can't say we don't have hot they do see a situation they know\nThey need help but you know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he has to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them or whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's\nA\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions\nOf what the United States purpose in the world is and what we owe and so forth but in in terms of being the best policy for the United states it isn't\nAnyway appreciate the jam thanks much will take a break and be back at\nUs and we need to rush radio Ninety seven\nHi I'm ...

people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there is a direct connection between political speech and violence that's a very serious thing to do\nThe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack\nWe always ask what radicalized from what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists you cannot divorce the actions of the sec individuals from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's Max Boot Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not very conservative but he certainly wasn't this\nWe have to ask the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic terrorists\nYou can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing so what he's talking about is you have an a jihadi\nWho walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to the among preaching and comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nHe's saying that's exactly what's happening in ... so somebody Donald Trump\nIs is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump and it's always\nA one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up the Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you don't want is rooted invokes it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms\nOf this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots\nAnd I am your spend golly and I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on their own\nI'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted in it's rooted in\nThe presumption ups superior intellect and people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nNever understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat what all of us had been saying to each other\nBut you you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed at or criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever then this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things\nSo the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how do you think or tell your window go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives are out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that

I Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected\nAnd the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd so gas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting as if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and er and accepted and it's this arrogance\nAnd just supremacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nA the synagogue shooting ... the obvious the obvious explanation\nIs that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this is is crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal\nWent increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you is isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people's still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want a cow town of the media still wanting to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut\nThe electoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
