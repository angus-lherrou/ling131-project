border officers John decker live at the White House\nSays the houses of Central American children and parents attempt to make their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump resumed tweeting about the migrant caravan asserting that criminals an unknown middle Easterners or amid the crowd\n\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass

is are they just want to come to America and that\nMay yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look at sea wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage\nIn the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for blue wave or a red wave election as an happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that where they didn't want it to last so he did what he could change if I\nDo know this despite everything that you think you would know with common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so

apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders headed for the United states as they marched into may go claiming labor inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who when their right\nMind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the boarder who in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt\nMakes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got\nTo be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world it's so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to\nThe young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by emotion govern solely by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people were right and wrong or to helping benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having them may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and say to the world come on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped\nIf it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers and so the Democratic party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as\nAn entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't

whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here is the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stop and invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do our Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and now\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you\nHe may not send the military they may call as a as a Congress and the government says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians\nWere about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think that people would eat demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks that the joke you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in an invasion\nEither way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nOf the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border if they bomb rushed the border like ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's on military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring them back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where it can't try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but I'm a little I get them on tape bond film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different

about how it's looking less and less likely and more and more toss up up for grabs as Republicans strength is surging in places that it was not seen earlier\nAnd this is shocked and surprised that Dr ... and their polling analysts that I'm here to tell you again\nI don't believe this I don't believe this is the way\nThings that I mean it can you know for individual voter to individual voter but when you're talking about blocks of voters\nIt just doesn't make sense that the vast majority of people back in December we're we're all intending to get rid of every Republican they could cause they have a Trump made a mistake voted for Trump knew it\nAnd then nine months later changed their minds but this is what they ask us to believe\nAnd that's why do this polling nine months out eight months out which doesn't mean anything\nOther than a you know interesting talking points at the time so still\nLots to get to as the program an falls before you're very eyes and ears up back to the Caribbean story 'cause we're not quite through with this\n... the the the the thing that that argues again for this being a Democrat Party operation or an operation intended to benefit the Democrat Party the Associated Press has changed headlines\nAbout the caravan after a bunch of liberals complained about an original headlined describing the illegal caravan as an army of migrants\nThat is the original a pie story on this that in ranged a bunch of leftists so the a P yesterday changed the headline after a backlash\nFrom liberals furious at them for describing a caravan of illegal immigrants heading toward the U.S as an army of migrants\nA rag getting growing army of migrants resumed march toward us read the original headline on the a P story a ragged growing army of migrants\n... changed the headline to replace the word army with caravan\nWell let's not a caravan either it's a mob it is an invading army might away not all of them are walking I mean you've seen the vehicle they're on a flatbed trucks there in ... whoever is paid for this is paying a pretty penny\nI've seen estimates of seven thousand dollars a person for this but I [noise] seven thousand dollars a person's eyes I say I've seen estimates I've seen estimates is this is costing\nUpwards of twenty million dollars and I don't know about that but I Know it's it's not cheap you have to feed\nSeven thousand people you have to provide fuel for those vehicles that are being used transport them now the cartels have that kind of money so to democratic donors have that kinda money some of them are walking a lot of them are walking\nAnd now there's a second caravan that has sprung up in ah in Honduras\nAnother a pie headline I'm Sorry to Los Angeles times stretching from ... seven thousand strong migrant caravan trucks through is ...\nEat in southern Mexico\nYou know I often break out a map I mean I Know my geography I Know where things are fact you know the what's fast Apple TV the Apple TV for cake in the

Guatemala El Salvador Panama now according to the map that I cracked\nCosta Rica in Panama are much closer to Honduras than the u._s. is Costa Rica's only four hundred miles from Honduras Panama is five hundred Ninety miles away the United states is twenty five hundred\nFrom Honduras [noise] some people say it's two thousand miles from to goose ... to ah Tempe er Phoenix in Arizona but take your pick\nTwenty five hundred in two thousand miles versus four hundred miles or five hundred if you're a scraping\nAbsolute filth and horror if you're a scraping poverty if you're a scraping holy ...\nOh you've got to do is get your neighbors and stop or maybe southern Mexico but they're not stopping anywhere they are heading right\nTo the United states\nThey're blowing past Mexican police they're blowing past immigration officials\nIt's a microcosm of what's happening every day in this country this invasion of people end up becoming illegal immigrants\n[noise] there's a lot of money behind this water Marla remember this Trump said that if a lot of my life in Honduras and El Salvador did not do their\nPart in stopping this that we were going to severely cut off or reduce massive foreign aid that we give them Trump has tweeted\n... Honduras El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country in the coming illegal to be us we will now began cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\n[noise]\nLet me grab a phone call quickly this is Steve and Gorman, California and that that that that uh [noise] after this I Want to go off the line\nTo Steve great great to have you how you doing sir\nNo good how are you sir\nFine and dandy great to have you on the program today\nIt great if I talk to your call screener and what I see is public Democrat Partridge injury because they had a problem in twenty sixteen enough Hispanics came out and voted for Trump looked at one of them do [noise]\nI've seen some stories that they aren't going to do it this time because the pocketbook issues but making good money taxes are lower jobs so if you park a whole thousands and thousands of people on that border and start buying the storage we're talking about where\nThe suffering there's no food there's this thing is that you wouldn't have people who are the candidate banger country man maybe extended nieces and nephews\nAnd while you go to the polls that week beforehand you look at those stories about the oil that level I think they're a guilt them with their strong sense of family I daddy into going back to the party even though they know and their own interest they should vote Republican okay\nAll right so let's let's let's walk through this\nIf I understood correctly you think that this is a Democratic Party operation because the Democrats are having problems with Hispanic turnout that happens to be true\nIt happens to be that more and and this is this is a presidential approval polling numbers Hispanics and African Americans are rating Trump's performance higher than anybody ever in their wildest dreams imagined it would be\nAnd in pre election polls the Spanish vote is trending Republican more than anybody ever thought it would be the Democrats are panicking over this\nAnd so if your rights than what they've done is put together this caravan\nOf Hispanics and Latinos hoping\nTo show how they are mistreated so that the Hispanics trending for Republicans will change their mind and not vote Republican because these people will not be allowed in\nWhere is it written and the other but I go into where is it written that every Hispanic thinks like every other Hispanic where\nIs it written that just because scientists panic limbs in the United states that every other Hispanic ought to be allowed in\nWhere is it written this\nExactly my point how many people you know who voted for Trump claim that the Democrats need to win now because Trump has to be stopped and all this tweeting has to be stopped and all these bad manners after based uh nobody\nSo why do you think the blue whitewashed autonomy I saw it on TV\nI see the polls why do you believe it\nWhere is the transit the Democrats are winning

the video fit\nTo be in a size they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis ... this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up in the standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know\nNational media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single

doesn't move doesn't say anything the other patrons in the restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such a shame that we lost civility and so forth and\nThis isn't this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democrats' side whatever you want to call a lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into what Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people\nSoon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can\nThat's a number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play with a hundred thousand

sympathize with if they don't show you the thousands upon\nThousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate you about well it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lot of years and military I retired from the more interesting although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so this situation and look I'm I'm One hundred percent for put in the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you say the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about that this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of think simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play\nIn the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not inflict thing and and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we are the individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the presence here is the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross okay what happened\nIf they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nBut you don't you and your ... your ears will let you use a one of the dummy is called I forgot that the ... you use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one going down to squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a ... Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take your next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's still a lot older than you thought they wish that we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWild and what is it what's the proper ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force I'm like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound and since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold a line provide a\nVisual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line and probably what Bush or talking about members of the immigrants illegal aliens but\nWe'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit than it would storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and essentially storm the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they're met the strength and\nWe just have to but even if there is a casualty or to the drive by their story Trump or white or Jerry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is to let them in nope\nNope half to hold a lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the closer legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYeah oh okay All right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio\nRain again you're listening to the network news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve ...\nKFI [noise] I'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHome advisor helped me find them back home pros in my area in the handle any kind of project you can read reviews of the pro check their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that Holleman minds are completely free to you\nGo to ... dot com boy download them ... to get started\nIt's people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well\nOur investment advice is about ... it's about providing your kids with opportunities for a head start in life feeling secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan\nWe believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your steeple financial advisor find your news people financial advisor rich people dot com that's S C I F E L people make wasn't company incorporated member S.

Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated Ron dissent this last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the

senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success because the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate\nI and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything for his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible knows a thing that worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nUh in in Florida

who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIt and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses

have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats\nI Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved with ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what\nReason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\nTrump to support it because he's in the last line to hold off\nOn this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party\nIt wants to happen successful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on is still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes you are not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes have happened or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish the Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference and so more and more what they want\nBy voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness\nThe Democratic party has become a party of ... means spirited extremism the Democratic party has become the home of people sadly what psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them\nAnd that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed any way\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put put one of these up\nOn the little camp if you're
