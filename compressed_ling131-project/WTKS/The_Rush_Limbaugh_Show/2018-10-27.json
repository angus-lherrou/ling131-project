{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "The choice which one do I want to do I want to water back up to it on battery deco\nYeah very good question it's really a matter of preference and you know we've talked quite a bit about the battery backup system battery backup systems going to cost a little more okay because you have a battery and you have more parts in pieces and an an an electronics to it\nUm in fact is probably going to cost ... about three times more than your water power backup ... elders and maintenance involved to not as much as there used to be with technology and the other hand I'm much any more but yeah if you're going to watch the battery and make sure that the batteries charged and everything's good to go\nOn the water powered is less maintenance significantly less maintenance I'm ... was was moving parts so to speak so is that is that connected to your water line ... ... it did is actually yeah it's actually powered by why usa venture a principal and Mrs water okay up to 'em\nAnd then there's a pumped into well\nUh it's it's a yeah technically upon not a traditional type right but that\nUses of a jury principle uses water to to push water and moves that out doesn't perform as well when I was gonna say it's got to have less pulling out rightly about half OK more than half of where we're at today okay to call for us maintenance that could improve\nBecause years ago it would be like twenty five percent yeah yeah\nSo that's getting better and we're actually um we're we're looking at coming out enhancing we call that product right now the home guard max and we're actually I'm looking at um coming out with another product in two thousand Nineteen that'll build on that\nOK more so what would ...\nWhy would they not want one because it doesn't pump as much I mean you've got to look at the the performance on the water pressure with the with you know because you're connected to the to the wireline the water pressure ... depending on what that is coming into your house can be a little maybe a little sensitive\nWhat do you need like sixteen years UPS or in that range okay yeah so you can't be putting it on a thirty five PSI Waterloo it\nYou know you can't have the wide yeah again at one end of the spectrum or the other day I got to kind of be in that sweet spot and how long will run [noise] uh it it'll\nIt'll run for a long as you have water pressure you write in Iran so that's an advantage yup that way so it's really comes back to you know what your what\nWould you know if you want that performance um you want want a maybe a little more durability and pay a little more of the battery backup system is ready to go but if you want to pay a\nLess and less maintenance\nMhm um but if you got to run and all the time I mean there's probably not a good choice there I'd be ... yeah right okay All right All right\nWe'll talk a little bit more about some pumps ... time as usual one of the neat features I don't know which one it is I always forget your numbers\nBut how big of a pump do I need is that where the plumber gets into figuring it out and then you've got one where the this I think is the coolest thing in the world I get excited about it really stupid things look plug glows so I Know myself bumps on that's the one I have a my home out of it right I can always tell ...\nYeah so the standard typical some palm I'm is either half horsepower or a third horse power and um what you're referring to their areas in the last couple years our our product development folks in engineering has done a really good job we've come out with what we call our premium series so we took\nA model fifty three has been our bread and butter pop and it's kind of what we in the ... category what we cut our teeth on how we built a business but\nUm we called our model sixty three and it has it's the same principle same fundamentals right on the palm\nBut we've added some features and benefits we've enhanced the switch a little bit engineering took some heat out of the switch which is the enemy of the enemy of any ... or electrical mechanical device so did a great job with that um put some more durable a seals and for harsh applications\nUm comes with a a five year warranty some kinda differentiates are a model fifty three the three year warranty looking for a little longer peace of mind or whatever security you got that and then actually I'd like to say we uh you know this was like the first thing on the drawing board but it was kind of last minute\nIsrael like hey it would be really cool if we had a a lighted\nI Love ... love right so I started off orange yeah you have your standard orange plug in our vendor did a great job we ask hey can you make it\nNow or green right answer green so he ended up they ended up making it the green so when you plug that ended a\nDrill after all it glows and you can tell there's power to pump which doesn't sound like a big deal if you'd be amazed at how many pumps we get back at the ... at the factories are and we talked about\nIn the beginning here um that that just the we plug it in in in Iran and what happened was there was just there wasn't any power at the or\nThere was ... yeah there was a G. F. I. outlet that was probably run is ready to that trip and yet yet but we're we're probably down to admit it or to mark but I I Want him real quickly we're going into the winter season\nA lot of people start putting in basements and remodeling and the the quick John ultimate is a very cool pump if you don't want to be digging through a concrete floor laying in the wastewater loads\nSo our court John ... is a is that the sewage removal system or up flush system and um it's perfect for basements remodeling for cabins for remote locations report all put a lot of ...\nAnd uh or or or or ... or um distributors so quite a few of them in our in the contractors installers put quite a few in in what that does is\nIt that it's basically a drop of brick aren't in the white on the surface of [noise] man or a cabin and it's got a comes with a toilet [noise] um\nCan come with a toilet and it's got a tank roses works at a loss right right that hurts a grinder pom pom and I'm a basically a fix it up and out of the house where you are not formed in Detroit was\nAlways good not to cut through a concrete floor in my book yeah her eye on lower pumps dot com they are you going to find all the information and again these are sold through the plumbing industry but to\nRecommend your plumber you probably already uses him if he does it tell me one of those all or bump mark thank you very much and your calls next look at you at home with Gary ... [noise]\nWith a call to guarantee Phillip had won eight hundred to three talk at home with Gary all the\nShe will not used to have a point seven to twelve ...

eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may have even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells me that if the caravan wore a Democrat idea design too embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and with\nPeople down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America\nAnd that may yet happen down the road that CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this is happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't\nThink anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media\nNarrative it was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this\nAgain the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of\nWhat's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs\nTo stop and Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf they're behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huffing puff talk about sending the military now and they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled prompt\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like the one in France didn't want to last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know with common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared that when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when\nRepublicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters begin to I don't no doubt\nIs the right word but they would be my only disappointing particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get it if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than that it's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has\nTo be making this happened folks we're talking we we've got how many\nTwo thousand miles stop and think of this from Honduras to the southern\nBorder of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start\nWalking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nPlace that they can then they're not technically allowed to apply for asylum here but of course none of this matters the objective is to get to the United states and the objectives are multi faceted and it's what leads me to believe that the primary movers behind this are the left\nI think it's it's no doubt a leftist operation from beginning to end it may well be a Hail Mary type of October surprises its eventual waiting but I think this was the left behind it for a host of reasons every one of which we should uphold\nWhen one thousand dollar a thousand bucks for me that every now and go on vacation or some other of thousands of laughing gas\nWas

others who would exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence provoked by some members\nOf the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of and by the way the [noise] the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pump pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence palm pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who\nIn their right mind wouldn't want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this one wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\nWhat ever the motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world\nIt's so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this company is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young\nWho haven't lived long enough to know what's best are being driven solely by a motion govern slowly by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people were right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life\nAnd having amassed a bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just raise the border and say to the world come on it\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket\nBut the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do the Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement\nWe have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense take a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nFrankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't for somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nErnie ... sixty seven dollars a month or Julie everything's included in this packet or once a year that a year's best prices on all ... earrings all ... how did you leave

people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or ... same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's palm pales saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people are trying to force their way and it's called\nAn invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor can call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ...\nThat normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens it has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way you know\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you didn't you you\nYou he may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says\nThere but there's no law says he can't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay\nWhat uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border to try to affect the mid term elections I Wonder if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside for seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the joke you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists thank God I was trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good listen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized is the border if they bomb rushed the border like the ... down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is about the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own leads to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is in

him kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to\nPromise to do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the\nMedia they've

for the lies and you keep falling for the hate\nYeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday the citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to have any more\nBut what is troubling is to look behind him and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes [noise] and he does it I think because it's still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you and Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected\nSaw he now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people do what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's probably knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump is ... is working is spending\nLike magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the Washington establishment never Trump hers hey resent the hell out of Trump could come knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you\nAre which takes me to one piece\nThat I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at\nYale his specialty is computer science but we have cited his work countless times\nOn this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the Limbong letter way back when computer science professor at Yale chief scientist at detach L L C most recent book tides\nOf mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd let me give you some pull quotes from this piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says\nFive centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any honest leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is\nBeaten and this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupt it was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this drug or larger says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to\nThousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the left only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America\nAnd hate America it does folks\nNothing every leftist hates America but the leftists either no right to alert in her at all they do hate Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they hate his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hate his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable\nAnd worst of all he doesn't have any ... except getting the job done\nHis goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself they hate Trump's vulgarity and yet they are the kings of vulgarity\nDemocrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity they but they sit there and hypocritical he claimed to despise Trump's\nThey hate that he won't walk away from a fight they hate that he is blind they hate he\nIs certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what I have found over the years the people that have had some\nProblems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I believed I've had so many people it's just not right and everybody\nAnd so you you just don't wait to nobody can be that kind of an open I Am I Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing they can't stand that\nThey love it quid vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching out with\nThe heart they hate certainty especially when the conflict with\nOwn now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities guy like swimming doesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in writer ashamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\nComputer science professor at Yale\nBasically basically saying the real problem a real problem is all you people voted for Trump you continue to ignore your betters you're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or his you are ignoring the media who are trying to warn you when you persist and go with the Trump rallies they can't stand it\nThat's why they make up these stories about gigantic blue waves sweeping you out of the way sweeping your candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to except they're the ones that are losing elections\nDonald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin\nThey can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections now the midterms coming up we'll get other lying to themselves about the future are going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump\nNancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power is that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump and the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they're left wing candidates really believe\nThat the American people are so filled with range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out that Trump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from\nThem and now it's time to make it All right and they are convinced did you what Trump investigated too and they're just fit to be tied they haven't persuaded you to join them\nSo now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to create a nation that consists of a majority of angry deranged\nLunatics in order to get what they the media and the Democrats want that's what they're trying\nTo create right in front of our eyes\n[noise] now you\nMobile weather ... Saturday afternoon nice weather breezy and high ranking close to Seventy for most will see more clear skies ... motivated fifties right along the coast I let me see take me to ... de Turley\nSean Hannity today is now more Rocky Mountain news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve ... tell you the K s so that you're listening to Russia's weaken review\nOkay time now to get to the phones at once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a violent Ohio David Europe first that I hire\nIraq's thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to NPR and Steve [laughter] hey a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call them all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR\nA personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the hardest jobs in the ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's locked it when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of people on the line went on they couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so ah your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what to enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listen to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for\nWhenever it means for them and that meant it they can ...\nYou know for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I'm interested in NPR is when they run the pieces to translate what I've said oh for their audience and and that happens when I get\nThe soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA lot of course NPR's not going to call it a mob\nNPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and the violence in whatever\nAnd they just organically happened you know these people is amazingly on the same day assigning believe\nAnd they just they just they just they just human beings they just have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremists cold hearted SOB zoo want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know and so base screwed Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of denied entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever it is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it ... right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob\nWhere packs of three and four or walking by and by the way\nFolks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you'd want to run in to [noise]\nYou know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's now ... for him he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people and let somebody in the all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I'm asking myself how in the world can this guy vouch for whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in\nTo tell everybody watching him that these are ... these are the prince and printer says in Central America these people are beyond reproach and he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think\nHoping and strategy don't pay off in the final two weeks before election I like these people the media got nothing to do with this caravan\nLike their buddies in the Democratic party and their leftist donors have nothing to do with this why this thing just happened and Trump and we know this because we looked at research data immediate says Trump made a big deal out of immigration and two thousand sixteen and he's doing it again\nWhy don't you people go all the way and accuse Trump of putting together this caravan\nI've been waiting for the ... to try that I've been waiting for somebody in the drive by just suggest that Trump the Republicans might actually be behind this\n\nThey quote Trump from his rally last night the Democrats don't care what they're extremist immigration agenda all duty or neighborhoods or your hospitals are your schools they don't care that the mess calming will totally bankrupt our country\nAnd then they quoted tweet from Trump every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered admitted germs\nIn these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats booked asked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist ed in the Senate yeah\n[noise] white\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony and the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focused statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatened to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador which\nHe has doubled down on by the way so this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups of two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nNow they're worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself\nAnd and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone you gotta put\nYourselves in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's ... loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been God's so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies got bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital of thing is backfiring on them and I got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality and their perplexed\nBecause none of what they have done his work in a white has worked at the it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied\nOver it they're at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really bumped\nThrush is always at work and he I have never closes Fifteen hours a week here what

it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed the former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise]\nSo I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing a shaggy right to Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill his showing it come back here and they started sending out bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn aide to Hillary Clinton Felipe rains\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy rains is is [noise] I mean the elevator doesn't go to the top floor [noise] like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal\nWhy would someone smart enough to make a functioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\nAnd ... and and so close to an election what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs hates the left\nThis much does he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise] um I actually think all candor that what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on you you watch Kevin all blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports in at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you\nAnd it is by the way it's not working what could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harass and threaten and bully Republicans what couldn't you'll be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective\nThere and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system and what's so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republican sue other words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just spreading hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired\nAnd leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely in saying lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters\nPerceive it okay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political scientists\nPolitical operatives a political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no\nCrafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says\nAnd it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding\nMeaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... but they're not building on anything\nThere's no way that's going to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing he says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how we described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats they project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more\nThey need but with\nEven a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away which bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nFor pollsters not the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this out for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it\nYeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but it\nDid credit card and it could go in either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go ... what what is all those indecision all of a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge\nI don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have their reputations all of a sudden\nIt could be really really close to\nMuch closer than we ever ever knew gets a cycle and you can print\nDeluged\nLocal weather

weeks in review quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixteen midterms how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\nNo no I mean how how ... or the or the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming midterms the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except\nThey are today I mean the Clintons announced yet this at Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour\nThird team locations stadium tour they're going to charge admission for people that come in and spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and talk about politics what what if there isn't a\nWhole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet buying tickets I don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clinton sucked on anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phone in collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftist weeding this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger that live in the mirror here's not sick I just it's just to pet\nIt it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is uh we'll see we'll let time on\nThe phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia or been within the kid a riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank you very\nMuch Russia you know it's a you\nTalked about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be on by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq Hussein oh\nYeah that that information is just not out there for the masses to obtain you know quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right or a to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered\nThe Democrats the proven time and time again there's simply no load that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something to swallow it tell it\nAlong all along those lines if you want to look\nAt it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning losing elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flipped that\nFlip that around what does it\nMake a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat\nIn cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us but the last nine months it was going to go more port going it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nThen the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires\nAnd these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives [noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border vi intention", "year": "2018",
