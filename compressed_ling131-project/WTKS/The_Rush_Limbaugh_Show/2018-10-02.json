for those of you not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentlemen was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a southern angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but CNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media\nOr are they really conservative websites or start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still at four years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the road for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City the federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming no we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio [noise] this is the by the way this more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know there are the techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris brick I think it was his name\nDrew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine an artist did his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fire was a no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford\nAnd judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of his ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [laughter] some public and the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web\nBut of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching on the digital camera this is the cartoon it has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside\nThe description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer and in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr forward\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot camera if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy if dirty it's disgusting it's despicable edit sick\nAnd of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people have seen it people are reacting to it and I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it in my never ending quest\nTo have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men didn't\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabin on his daughter says another prayer\nDear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people\nWho at some point in their lives have suffered psychological ones of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic\nThese rallies will be urging Trump to drop Kavanaugh for the sake of the party and the second Trump's presidents that was the exact opposite\nSo I don't doubt me on this sense of what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power in their self esteem related to their power and that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick it\nDisturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did on CNN NBC News\nDesperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump clothing with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat\n\nOn able to independently corroborate sweat next claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating ticket parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was at ten parties where capital and his buddies running rape trains gang rape trains they can't find anybody who saw what sweating it was a college student when Kevin on his buddies rifles students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school party and\nI keep going back to gang rapes if that's what's happening to these parties or lawyers center that\n\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research\nYeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties to gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me they are looking at NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw swipe Nick at parties with Kevin Kevin ... has said he doesn't know sweat Nick and has called her claims a farce\n\nEx boyfriend says what next threatened to kill his unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie sweat neck is incredible just like Christine foreigners incredible\n... told me about a year but\nBeen through a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than to have it all there is no credibility in either to sweat\nSweat that gives a credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible there\nIs no credibility on the allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night uh Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie you swipe next ex boyfriend or Richard of Venice the details why is the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable Dennis ... says let's wipe Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted the him\nYeah ex boyfriend

last night on the ... ankle according to Venice the sweat and they told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think as represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately respond to Fox News requests for comment but in an interview on CNN Monday Night he cast doubt on the boyfriends credibility and characterize them as an a strange ex\nBoyfriends\nNBC again we kept corroborate any of the claims made by Julie sweating it can also her claims have now shifted\nSweat ... said she saw boys congregating outside rooms but I didn't know what was the current wait

to\nStand behind this\nIs this what they want to vouch for they're backing off of that this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne\nFeinstein all of a sudden this habit of bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again of his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons\nOr are thinking on why that's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so\nYou imagine how they feel about this\nThat mean they're fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon Whitehouse is number not Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged\nPages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened and he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking with Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finished this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied and we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview marble they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation [noise] I also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think\nThey probably should be able to ah get this done by friday of really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute\n[noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit with Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles said the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth\nJust yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying is about ... perjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rapists next he froze ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kavanaugh in anything\n\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak doctor for a letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou don't just dozens of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference were either on the borders of the Judiciary Committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\n[noise] I was all part of a strategy so late\nYesterday afternoon on Shepard Smith reporting on Fox News channel trace Gallagher was sending him for ... Smith\nAnd he had the legal affairs correspondent for National Public radio on their Nina Totenberg said Mitch McConnell said friday he thinks the Democrats won't agree that we're limited scope and the FBI investigation\nNow today they're asking for twenty four witnesses to be interviewed what are your thoughts on that ...\nI remember when I broke the story I thought this was the closest kept secret and I managed to find out about it I found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington who knew this secret and kept it for a very long time you and I\nAre not stupid people we may not be praying for are not stupid and once you get us on a case like that\nAnd lots of people are talking to each other one leads to another and it doesn't have to be a member of the Senate who lake it doesn't even have to be a staffer who lake it doesn't have to be a member of her law firm it's just out and that's what happened here\nThey interviewed a first for that were named and have branched off from there as my understanding and apple\nSenators like sitting there waiting to learn about the FBI findings before deciding support for the Supreme Court nominees\nFox has learned that the FBI
