it's ... and ... if you I'll be glad to tell you what I Know about this and it is it is somewhat there's somewhat fascinates name as ... a shell game that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump has been openly asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealthy which was made to look like a jet setting party animal\nBy Robin Leach so whether whether Jim aka show is related to him and I couldn't even find out just habit Jamal ... as a critic\nOf Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin some on as the crown prince\nIn Saudi Arabia his father is the king king sol ...\nHe is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the ... are they the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused because\nThe world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends in the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys is winding dined Facebook guys met a lot of time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new\nCity out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy a really attractive short little stocky but he represents\nIf he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women he is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without mail at company when is made him quite controversial he also last summer not this past summer last night it\nPast summer he arrested the elite of the elite of Saudi wealth some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it do to corruption and connections and storms he made a lot of enemies\nWell Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed been so long\n\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father the king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power\nAway from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on\nDespite their reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example\nJamal ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding lie a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the he had supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nHe went in to get a marriage license he was wearing get this he's wearing an apple watch is I found that was connected all watch was outside in the car with his fiance who was outside waiting on him to get his

country is that it ranged\nBut the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or high\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir\nI so I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue to reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan\nIs it the only game plan they have and they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same market and the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump everything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked\nAnd so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away at well that\nTrue too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't show up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does it they can discouraging us enough to make it not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up to convince them to convince other
