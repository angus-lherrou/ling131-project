they have been counting on they have been\nThey've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps

this\nIs going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waving to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his

two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor ... when does your support for Trump again during\nThe campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that\nDemocrat my whole life that these people are happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only my shelf people in the neighborhood because she said it before it was you were born um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says she only reason the only way I can get my message out well his choice to good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he does not address the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm going to really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd the press conference fish they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he's done the greatest time economically that I can ever remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shocks you write\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration in the U.S\nIs with a news media and many people are in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if\nThey are but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up or might never seen anything\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact\nShe's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nSo we take a break for that has to have to say rush obligated by being met for\nRadio not used to have a voice will\nAll right to

do you most worse I think we have salmon and the W. kids is Rima reminded this morning if you live in the Palmetto State you only have\nAnd it's amazing\nHow honest it is about what journalism is now this is not about\nContemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them small one of them is very serious take them to feel very seriously don't do the tabloid anything [laughter] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than\nPure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees\nThey're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules in the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nThere miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs led if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it\nWas all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched\nThis I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\n\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected\nBy life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then
