I'm Pam who sells Fox News that from President Trump referring to the top Democrats in the Senate and house Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi\nThey get even testing Indian DNA because they didn't have any and she goes out and announces this\nSo she's one one thousand twenty fourth Mexican one one thousand twenty fourth Peruvian\nOne one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of empty and DNA\nWhy is there not much Indian DNA out there or was the problem that bustamante couldn't find any matches\nFor Warren using only in the ... so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include in South America when other reason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of this the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe the leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine who many engine they use junior logical trace\n\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in the Salt Lake city has one of the most advanced respected\nDocumented genial logical praise organizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that the story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that had been extended to them as a result of this and they just don't want upsetting the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but\n... the media of course has a role here because everything they've reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except for this inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't\nAny Native American DNA and by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she would have to take a test from a little kitten with wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... hammer take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate a future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do and he ... that she wouldn't show up as in the ... if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party and threw out the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up\nAfter two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over maybe take back their vote for Trump and this is gonna be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all and two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party who lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nAre you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over a hundred seats\nThey were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nAnother election where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had it they couldn't have had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set a gaffe they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand six needle elections\nThe Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office\nIs held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties now the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand\nTen the first chance people had to vote after having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nRock Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blue wave this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence\nIs this going to happen what is it that has stopped the trend the people in this country have been voting against Democrats\nIn ways unprecedented I mean to have with the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democrat Party ... on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today but you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise] probably put CNBC ... survey\nSoaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight Tim this is a CNBC polar survey\nIs experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven\nHis career in front of us are of a stadium or arena sized crowds\nI guarantee you Mitch McConnell got the kind of warm welcome standing ovation dad he simply is not used to hasn't I mean it nobody else liked the turtle in our party gets those but Trump brought him up and he got one and he got it precisely\nBy holding steady in the spine on Kevin I'm telling you Trump is\nWith the assistance of the Democrats treatment of Kevin all the Republican Party not all of it but it's it's\nIt's moving toward unification at least in terms of opposition to the Democrats the Democrats are not unified and one of these four of them\nSay they want to be president now\n[noise] now

damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted ... white the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter but I Know a lot of people who are and then the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nFind the time so tempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her the Stanford\nUniversity researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American\nDNA the Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans\nNow she's out there touting that it's true is she is an MD she got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in our Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is pathetic\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself each and every ballot they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica limit no no no no no no it was not abuse that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks him or herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who or soon to be barking on what a stadium shore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged them like this I mean if Trump didn't do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get it on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like people care\nWhat Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say there is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say\nThere's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent had it\nAnd I'm Talking about this ... type of charisma back in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had a number of the the aura was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\nThe wake of Donald Trump you know what this is like is it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and Gary Hart parents\nSome ... some of the state treasurer of Texas they gave a radio show Mario the pious they gave her radio show and the media highlighted every one of these Democrats radio talk show who had never done it before as but Russia killer\nEvery one of them was anointed end inaugurated as the Democrat that was going to steal the limelight away from this program than Air America came along and\nUh and they did the same thing and it never has happened every attempt to supplant take over relegate this program ... security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds and the one that you may think rush there are enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks\nYou may think that what we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't drop ... campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very\nMany of them it would've been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones where we're big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not\nWaiting with bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for brief moments of this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is

[noise] no no no Trump should not a quarter horse race and the sixty\nMinutes not don't\nJust take once you get the night before and okay\nStory I'm Pam who sounds Fox News\nEighteen people from Saudi Arabia are under arrest as king Solomon calls for the restructuring of the kingdom's intelligence service death after the stunning admission on state TV that journalist ... was killed earlier this month inside the county consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nThey even tried to make up the evidence with the phony ... they tried to manufacture it they planted allies all over the drive by media\nNothing has gotten rid of Donald Trump nothing has turned the American people against Donald Trump can you imagine the frustration these are people who get their way every single time they target somebody for\nStructured whenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs on somebody there as good as gone already damaged beyond repair they haven't lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh don't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't leave with it because they knew they couldn't prove it they didn't leave with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball Z foreign could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was ever partner plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe\nThat uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom\nTeaching students if she does that mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how you talk to the balls before and you run into rather beach Santa Cruz that's not how she's going to be talked she's you're running around the beach out there\nUh and she's not going to be talking to you like he's in perpetual fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled out or whatever ah\nAnyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things\nThe the real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they have been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... to the thirties and under the twenties then they could get rid of him they failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd then the process Kevin last thing they actually turn some people who are sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying\nA human being and a wife when there isn't any evidence\nThat would warrant such a thing but the Democrats didn't care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create an daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse\nThan poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked and even in their own\nPost Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the\nApproval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy they ...\nI I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it all together and it's in this universe framework contacts I just I don't see this massive blue wave that they do and I'm not sure they even see it\nI think they're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be\nAnd I got to do everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for them [noise] we'll\nSee I mean look it's possible I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now and using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against the Democrats having fewer seats\nElectoral seats in Washington than they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq Hussein all\nSinglehandedly made this happen for rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party and it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy\nAnd he was African American and check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate where is the worst plugs Beto O'Rourke\nHeard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke raise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing bet do has told them\nTo go pound sand that tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raise the money yourself I'm going to ... been this way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople will remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he fought it was so but leave him he had he wanted\nNo part of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was nice the\nOffice of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with his mom didn't have confidence of coattails and that ... is not going to want to share in any of his money\nNot being good socialist got all this money if not their best to oh who's by the way what does he down seven or eight points now the latest ... uh\nNot fair that Beto has more than he needs and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do\n'em yeah outlook also have the um the shell game situation\nAnd there's some things about this guy but I don't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by his purpose here is again the drive\nBy as are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to show ... murder might away just so you know there are a couple of CNN ... pronounce it can cause show

mini series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day\nAnd it's amazing how honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic explores the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of them's big one of them smoke\nOne of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't do tabloid anything [noise] don't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than the furor trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has\nTo be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the gun suits breaking the rules there has to be something mistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out\nAnd and and ruin them which many many years ago\nWhen I first began to encounter the media\nAs a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it\nAnd they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that ... it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody that can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the\nEarly days of sixty minutes it was all about that and it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy any day now is Donald Trump\nAnd any Republican who gets in the way like Brett Kavanaugh it's all about destroying the but the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for\nI don't recognize the names of the producers\nAnd I haven't taken the time to Google and many of them but I watch this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how raising early on is this is one of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most despicable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides\nHis journalists is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions and he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode went to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k.\nNo no no no not sexual just that they're that they have some kind of a relationship it's not clear to me like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an injury away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else for the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in\nIn the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would've ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like and live with it and the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to post or the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise] it's just it's quite it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people no conscience the belief that everybody is law that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ...\nAnd at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalists are going to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's it exposes too much uh people have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than\nBe could attain to buy it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover haven't confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other members doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls that got us a feat of I'll just get it up there and get it on the newsstands whereas the female editor didn't have the guts to run it and so the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously you're not worried about the me too movement here ever put this thing together so the name of it is ... I have no idea it's it's I think it just completed airing 'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um\nIt's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix Amazon Prime wherever I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here\nAnd if you watch these kinds of things it's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that\n[noise] if it's it's hit everybody everybody is a rapid rate including the people at the papers the reporters I I have to admit I was so [noise]\nAnyway here's ...
