it not not not when the media is promoting that whole as middle name Kennedy\nThey're promoting his good looks promoting the woman ... thing that promote well I mean if you're going to promote Kennedy you got to promote it all I'm not accusing about all of that but if you're going to say hey I'm just like the Kennedys then you've got to be in just like the Kennedys stay away from sixty nine Oldsmobile\nOn bridges but I mean not a single person voting for Beto can tell you one of these issues because it doesn't matter\nAnd in many of these other places the Democrats are running on issues that are not at the forefront of people's minds or they are on the wrong side\nBut if you're really stop to think about it mob behavior bullying the appearance of insane rage in anger is all they have left\nThey don't have any issues or policies to run on for the same old reason they can't be honest\nOr they've got plenty of policies all they got plenty issues all they have\nPlenty of ideas they

bite me\nCrazy Bernie who is losing popularity and if you haven't heard Hillary Clinton has all but made it official she's running again in twenty twenty\n\nHillary Clinton a two time loser wants to

they've tried everything they can to get rid of Donald Trump and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with fatal year\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort to get\nDonald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bowling\nIn ... behavior it's their only\nAngle and they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty\nFour seven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was\nHow the drive by media working with the Democratic party was going to get rid of\nDonald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump removed from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders are the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat\nBase and I mean\nThat specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed they've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really\nAnd it's all\nBeen about having Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times they brought up the cabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth they they want him out of office every day now\nThe failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that are twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls the Ford\nThat was a tool for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career his

control where is this story that young people\nHigh school and college students in had enough of them are going to take control of the apparatus of government and they were going to get rid of guns that are going to wipe out the n._r._a. where\nIs that the day what [noise] but\nOh camera hog is still there and the next time something happens that makes him a useful to be brought back to live there he will be again\n\nMy point is these are all manufactured\n\nTailored people and the issue is based on a happening or a moment but none of it is organic or reveal what do you mean Russia's Syrian David ... he's totally real but he's a media creation\n\nAs David Hawk doesn't have an audience David ... did not literally create a bond needed as okay seal protest these people do not have connections with an audience they don't have connections with voters\nLike Trump has are like other successful people in media do they have been made media heroes by the media but it isn't real\nLike ... gone but nobody's alarming ... where we miss hog women we want to see up nobody's saying where's hog\n\nAnd that's not a criticism he hasn't had time to build up a connection or an audience ... point is none of this is real it's all soap operas script\nMaterial what's another one the me too movement\nHillary Clinton has affected we killed that by saying my husband you can't say that he did

it\nThat the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon Trump do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as that as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nAs all the time so are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nNow I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe you know Trump\nTrump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's doing a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... I all I can say these are smarter man than I Am\nA navy but but I\nDo see that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to ... and ... for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding the zone\nWith four thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump pass a bill but Waldor Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective\nThose people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOh I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well but my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised\nAnd that's the that's the uh no that's exactly right and the moon right there that was four in the Trump supporters\nThat we haven't got the wall and we want it's not even you know that they aren't even begin to foundation yet and I think even started so it really aggravates me personally that this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey I'm with you all up you're talking about all of the spending bills we've had new budget ... we've had continuing resolutions\nUm we Democrats can't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that\nThe leaders in both parties do not want that wall\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\nThey they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and that there's\nA lot of other things that they didn't want that he's he's a a that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut in many of the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was not to be gone or a before now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets\nI I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow to reverse than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side\nWell we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm pill left Saudi Arabia after having that when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either

some Senate cities I think the house is very very much in jeopardy\nYou are not buying into these are scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't tell those sites I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats as another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play was only about two or three Democrats seem to replace Tony on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break you\nLet me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff and to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers\nAre based on data that is the result of polling\nAnd I know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just like I said in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six day and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone\nSo maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden you want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone Raj Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates him [noise]\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow support their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that's\nHave to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats say the justice associated with the Democrats are doing his landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated with they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey have in that continued to try and portray America as as unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest\nThe trend of voting against Democrats has reversed\nAgain I acknowledge house races are not the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance\nShannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon Bram a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think this is coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the fat is\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy ... votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve killed and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason why what was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my point it's not a single poll\nNot a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten people in D.C live and die by their ... and I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just\nCouldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree with him a I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think there's a lot of people not being contacted up next to Kaylee Mac a nanny\nAnd these two weeks shipping is also free called eight hundred eight
