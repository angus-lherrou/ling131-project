that was sent to CNN didn't even get sent to the right place\nIn terms of where people work at CNN and it was addressed to John Brennan a who doesn't even work at CNN he was over at at a at MSNBC so

think right off the bat that\nSome Tea Party or did it or some talk radio fan dated or some Fox News viewer did it turns out it's never ever the case [noise] not one of these bombs went off\nAnd if a

mad I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative\nAnd you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up you have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you if\nAll of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports than at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs\nStorm restaurants and harassed and threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing\nThat really makes any sense to show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans\nThat other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do not words the politics of hate and anger and the attempt just spreading hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got\nIs we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment that's all they've got\nAnd so if none of that work if all of that backfired and ball leave me and has especially the Kavanaugh stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of the worst that has backfired on them like you cannot believe\n[noise] so what would you do\nYou might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side\nYou might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact of lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it\nOkay let's get some of the election analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website but many political scientists political operatives\nA political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there and do something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so Tom ... cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he\nSaid that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the\nTop of it here and Tom ... all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue\nWave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead and the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that ... but they're not building on anything\nThere's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real ...\nIdols hand to hand combat is how we described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one the seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states twenty five and a half to two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and I went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world but Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all of\nThese things don't mean mean nearly as much as they have in the past the cause of Trump neutralizing much of it\n[noise]\nAnd Trump is the great unknown as these rallies\nContinue now another retired historian and political analyst sends an email that I received\nA lawsuit but I've been able to have that was just this morning and I'm going to identify who this is doesn't matter I don't know you've heard of them but I just want to share with some of the things I get some of that is by the way legitimate some of it is obviously tried influenced me\nA into promoting whatever it is that since I have to be very very careful about so I'm just I'm I'm gonna relate this to you this passionately\n\nThis guy who is an historian who has studied American politics and congressional races along the lines of of Michael Barone\nJust not as well known as he looks things here is an absolute\nRed wave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert any of these trends in there with actual prediction until now\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive by is ushering everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's got to be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys mislaid change the story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again it probably won't\nDon't worry about it Bloomberg's a but it it could it could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose big it going to ... what what is old isn't decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nHolds couldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months you name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct\nSo they still have their reputations all of a sudden it could be really\nReally close much closer than we ever ever know it's a cycle and you can print\n\nFox News alerts I'm Lillian ... bomb squads responding to more reports of such as this packages in New York City area and D.C

mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now at Obama certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left just tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger their life in America is not sick it just it's just too packed it it's just\nIt's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nForm ... and a educated

you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by spin on this will be that uh we have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know if that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be run by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq who said oh you know that that information it's just not out there\nFor the masses to obtain you know there was never any of the country to use devices to make their way through their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers at certain D. but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and muggy video that\nCame out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the wife of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't stoop to something that's whoa it\nTell along along those lines\nIf you want to look at it that way it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning losing elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip that\nFlip that around would it\nMake a lot of sense for a democratic operative or Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have assured us for the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe their lives remember\nThey believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it then they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by

or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary\n... yeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nWell tell me what it was ... tell me because I stepped on and tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ...\nUm there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight with signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can't have a woman for president those you know the success Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary enemy of domestic beer

separate\nIt was already planning to go to waste it was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave my idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically could it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade
