what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people will give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me at Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally having the president of the states where people up into a

rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as Jim you can get but you got\nAll kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiter you obviously listen well Mr

was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting a good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to them after was over and I talk to him about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand Amos let the media and they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises the guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising gr violence ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and

call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the border John's into ... making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mark they use what whenever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people well that's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nThat there's you know thousands of the line well and he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this news\nThat NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listening to MPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it\nThey can\nDo for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh\nAbout the only time I registered NPR is when they run and pieces to translate what I've said\nOh for the audience and and that happens\nWhile I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nA ... of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people who are these people\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day it was I Believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings we just have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying we're talking about Trump being you know an assault base screwed Trump Trump simpler trumps the Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thing or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful a Democrat causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited\nPart of that they don't care about the suffering and denied entry in this kind of thing but but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened and we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but there's no political objective attached to this is absurd [noise]\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of\nWhat's this guy's Jorge way most or ... or whatever it is it in what does it tell among do ... what what what is a tell her tell her no but what is it ... right and he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it\nI don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThey don't look like the kind of people you want to run in to [noise] you\nKnow on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past him he's not looking at I'm behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that they're decent people and all they want is a better life and we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in that all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how would the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience\nRemain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats asked about the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this even before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway\nWhether people show up in groups to her five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's\nBut when you stop and think
