York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants the times has on that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we got Trump out there they claim he's mocking ball the forty wasn't mocking or\n... I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God I don't know why the president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it he had to everybody has to\nBefore all this is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it's deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine balls before there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying there were teeth and you can demonstrate last week was not the time to do it so Trump joined the chorus I find a compelling I find her very\nCredible will now she's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed 'em out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack like he didn't believe her\nWhat an odd been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearings committee hearing her allegations would be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or otherwise or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all he did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this one you know the New York times it's been investigating that Trump's for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what\nOne word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess what I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hit\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's\nTax returns Russia ah ten for bats they wanting Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would\nProve Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and then not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to they're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a potent storage\nTrump wasn't totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\n[noise] a bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience just don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all at Johns\nYou're not watching I don't know when you're driving out of elbow to ride a bike with what you're going to come up with just like you're not gonna you're gonna come up with women like New Hampshire gray the ... not a\nDemocrat and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial that ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript and anti Kavanaugh protester with confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nWhy wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your life your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with programming robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback that it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid\nBy George Soros and she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCash that you know no would you like and on corroborate a charge destroyed I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protestor\nOh wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're all care for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protest you know there is evidence look at a standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage in these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there were really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me\nTo raise doubts it took me longer than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically

testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat\nGives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that Trump\nWill tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how easy it rotates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed ... adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did just three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\n\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I\nKnow Murkowski and Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nHold my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for\nWhat she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me two were all women can joined can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me to\nWill\nRush or a million women or nor do they actually do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump did was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nFor our country that's what this is that's what the Democratic party is and so that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused has to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that ...\nResidents from outright mockery of a sexual assault survivors riddled as it was with false was reprehensible beneath the office of the presidency\nSources tell Fox News the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct could wrap up as early as today and misery down to one abortion clinic as a legal battle plays out the only other clinic in the state that\nPerforms them doesn't need new state requirement\nHuman side\nBeyond exceptional dentistry in Savannah creates rave reviews here just a few things in the end because that's not the industry the name has um I don't trust any other debt them special and with my smile\nI went there with pain in my job headaches in job hopping that no one had been able to resolve now I'm Out of pain and enjoy smiling\nIt's more of us is by experience than a dental that that there were cars meticulous and the results are seller for beyond exceptional dentistry right here in Savannah called two three four eight to eight to\nHire the people here in Johnson City Tennessee talking to you the voter about what you think about the Brett Kavanaugh situation\nThey should be innocent until proven guilty and Jeff ashamed of arson and you can't came many I think at Kavanaugh has proven himself over Thirty years of his integrity and um I hate when he's had to go through\nThe sexual assault as serious serious allegation is that that college students especially hard on this man there's no evidence against him\nUp like around telling the truth that I Believe it or they all the news of the men\nAnd women can create a problem that I did regard that fact that this is going on\nNone of us are without sense you're not going to find a Supreme Court justice is perfect except for Jesus with pirates of the people I'm ... [noise]\nWhat is every Saturday or Sunday Morning at nine o'clock for crime suffers focus where we take you behind the scenes and police work we talked with some of the people in law enforcement like Richmond Hill police chief mid shores long before we got that job spent twenty five years as a savannah police officer chief shores as there was never doubted his mind he home\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them he writes for\nCall a civilian gets orange\nWanted to be a ... that's one of those things that I desired as a little kid I always wanted to be the place I was on a patrol division the first nine years of my career and invented hired a former major from the Miami Dade area by the name of chiefly he started a unit here\nCalled the career finger tracking you know the acronyms cod which was pronounced costs you and then he selected a small number of people to be in this unit and then sent them to Miami to work in trying\nTo I was one of the ones who was fortunate enough to be selected to get to go to Miami worked for a little bit with that you worked in the initial stages of developing that unit here you know police for has so many different aspects\nI had a particular love and that was just the hub for one of those people who wanted to be a police officer because I wanted to remove\nThe bad guys are the people that shouldn't be on the street from the street basically to make life easier for the law abiding citizen was assigned to a federal task force for the U.S marshals\nSo I got to work for the U.S marshals fugitive task or the same time I worked for the career tracking use so basically all I did full time\nWas really bad people don't believe she matures joined us every Sunday Morning and none of the conference focused\nOn Hannity today at three now more rush on news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve Ninety eight yeah do you think Kay s so bad [noise]\nBreathing so walking back Rush Limbaugh but yeah I mean I'd work books to your ear is the is the James was dubbed the gym and guarantee quote from a National Review\nUm the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics and all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem\nAdmitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare moments I was unable to\nThis is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this uh ... well the me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be\nThat debate but it never was a and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether boys want to pretend to be a girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nI stick it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it\nAnd they never do they never that rage and the anger never ends if only gets worse\nBecause the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply resign did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats there to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they've been even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was a flight out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy and here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the rosy for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they bowed miserable you think the president's maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun adds to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately somebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed to speak to you again a right to have your back yeah\nIt can be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into abnormal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while the other like couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise] can't believe any of them and I think that what this\nThis whole me to get away with that\nEver man credited anyway at that that is by exactly what I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for a man you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant capturing the Kennan this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nYou have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believe it\nWill rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about living rates are also the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nYou\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claim that all men are predators but then they run to the white hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine [noise]\nHooked on it if not better right by the way here's this ... you're also right of it's not all\nWomen but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women women on across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get it notarized after the date\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I look I think she's an activist and then on it [noise] but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin or what not sit there and let his life me destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story and the media is all over the place now saying well you know this\nThis may screwed it mccaskey and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kevin off\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but they're no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heap big reelection trouble\nIn fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave in the Senate\nNone of blue wave in North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll\nTaken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before that committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana and similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out or that some Republican\nSenators would win out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nLook at words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnell a McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves\nThat maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states they're held to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors a power line writes that a reader of theirs\n\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford\nHerself presented the power line reader refers\nTo himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic he created a chart in essence\nOn public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it\nIs the dates the varying dates the different dates of the ... event Dr ... says happened\n\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get that isn't just a second his question why the sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July six of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat orbit some Anna Eshoo Democrat California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists as they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try no tried served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some uh some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christine Blasey Ford's ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged\nIncidents in the therapists notes the incident is said to have occurred and the men the Nineteen eighties when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story of courage and not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text message to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties in her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened in the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high school summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that before\nShe had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo\nDeborah cats the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault occurred in the summer of any two when she was just Fifteen conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text message\nHere is that President should order your phones that are ... yeah I forgot to warn people about this to Eighteen today there is an emergency warning system test\nIt just happened to my watch started going crazy\nAnd I'm going to delete the test is just the past it's not an Amber Alert it's
