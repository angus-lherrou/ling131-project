Democrats in the run up to the mid term elections\nAnd if I were you I've I'd hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this I in a in an added to it in a way\nI Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is uh\nThat that's happening out there so it's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nIt's just not the most important election of our lives two thousand sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years of Hillary had one\nWho wouldn't be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing if you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election is uh the the the drive by us have their formula\nAnd it's rooted in the desire they habit everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data and says the media so have strong they want everybody else to\nTherefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have awaken realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in the history of landslides a Democrat Party deserves to get\n... for the tactics they have engaged in from the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nAnd it just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly in the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my\nPoint is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide provided that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking the Trump about the suppose or the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us well\nI I mean what's the allies we have wonderful relationships with a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union the lion was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is high and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot sauce on the way they treat us\nWe're not how somebody can in dealing with in within the stupid country for so many years I knew willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like they don't then is fine\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade like going to do it any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile to have the\nIt sounds so hostile it sounds so mean eight pounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still\nFunctioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises that I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it already ... says he's going to do something he's going to do it or die trying\nThe rally a little bit on friday but Wednesday and Thursday we are just incredibly chaotic what was driving all that volatility\nBut we used ... for reasons for this move first the fed they're less accommodated than ever raised their benchmark rate so market rates have

forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nIs it you know General Mattis that to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances in St prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you one more time\nOkay I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO [noise] but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments explosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice it sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less we still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got it in a roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf that I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell them about my opinions of the ... he said to her\nI had no idea and I'd be really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president I had no idea I being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker\nAnd immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local York's made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked I was really surprised this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the

Trump and the first lady are in sort of\nIf other where the ... and the top fifty percent of all taxpayers pay Ninety seven percent of total individual income tax so in other words the bottom fifty percent\nPay three percent there isn't much more you can do to cut their taxes and yet how often do you hear every pot both parties politicians running\nAround and we're going to middle class after the middle class pregnant burners through red but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore when it comes to income taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or\nMore it's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth\nOf a percent for teen hundred taxpayers\nThat group alone paid free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty which is a little round that to fourteen hundred\nFor teen hungry tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent\nIn two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent of the top\nOne thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people sheltering last they avoid if if if if you tell people they're going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping\nForty cents or fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to pay it plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more is actually part and parcel\nWith the theories behind supply side economics of supply side tax policy at the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that fourteen hundred people for\nTeam hungry people out of three ... some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt is\nThe rich are not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they are getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the left ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than you is not fair to not paying your fair share and their

be happening here is Kanye goes on so is the\nRacist here the son of Mario the pious who sees race everywhere all the time even when it's not present even when he cannot pinpointed\nAnd my house in an

this guy's going to do wonders for me how does he know what's going on in Trump's then\nYou have a crystal ball\nBut no he's not racist I\nThis is the kind of I think it's I Know this is not going to

befuddles me though back to the Trump sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall we were up here at number oh this is a big\nNumber three this is Trump talking about the necessity of consequences for illegal immigrants\nLeslie stall question what about the force separation of migrant children from their parents\nAlways the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books but he didn't enforce that line for them were launched that the narrow tolerance power\nTo deter families with children and then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation and frankly when

that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now to that that if if you have one drop your going to be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection holiday requires quantification yeah

welcome that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later is now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an oppressed where you are it's called intersects analogy because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's red intersection Natalie for me\nGreat on wash your you're talking or you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes an intersection out on the action is basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist having this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation it's with that with militant Islamic feasts that then with illegal immigrants and their activism and we're all of these people intersect is why they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth India and she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to

this is something what do you mean sub zero one is is what it was it and then you start talking to the sub continent then some people really get confused you're coming from from India or over to sub
