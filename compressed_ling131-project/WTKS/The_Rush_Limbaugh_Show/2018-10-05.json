the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the

Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of

went through all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously she went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who they voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump

McLean at who's home ... was in ... Delaware at the time the letter was written McQueen former FBI spokesperson also worked for ...\nThe reason I'm going through all this is the balls the Ford is is using people that are tired and linked ... hip and the heart and brain the Democrat Party activism from the FBI to the department of justice to the Senate Judiciary committee\nNow Monica McLean lawyer happens to be a guy named David Wasserman according to the Washington Post David off men helped oversee the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server\nProblem which she was exonerated\n... also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election campaign in two thousand six neat so how\nIs it ... balls the Ford ends up in the home of a woman who is\nTied to the D. R. J. and the FBI\nAnd characters who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump Russia collusion investigation how does that happen\nIf you're just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Paolo Alto and you'll see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be on the Supreme Court and you don't think you should be because you think one time he\nAttacked you you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein the next thing you know\nWell no no no that you sent find signed a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McClain who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Cleveland Kaiser as a he is not a woman which he is\nSo you're just you're a beach pay him a psychology professor whatever from California\nAnd you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware after saying you're afraid of flying and their lawyers don't tells you that the committee's willing to fly out to California to interview you\nI I I Want I didn't know I I ...

was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that romantic I take that back or one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes and form so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic amateur load I certainly what's the old saw\nIt's not for us to criticize who loves who and why\n[noise] so uh yeah it can be a ... bat lovers quarrel we don't know\nBut I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confined to assure cocoa confined them himself or it may beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking stories [noise] and it's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is\nKind of interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is filled breeders\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh and he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh this was in the ... this was in the middle of a campaign here now I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nThat Murkowski went to the administration I Trump and bargain her votes\nFor exploration writes in Anwar\nAnd I worked up and Trudeau I Know what that's like the revenue that field brings to the state\nIs correct that's correct you're right I remember that you're exactly right and why I think I Know where you're going this is a hell of a pay back\n[noise] yeah well yeah that was some resistance is ... is is there a

the Murkowski for going against capital Yes sir it wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm\nToo many people will be hurt too many people be hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her in her state so I don't know um the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump\nIt would most likely include Kavanaugh what does that do for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nThat can play you mean to be impeached is well\nAbsolutely sir\nNo no no that they wouldn't bite that much off um get rid of capital I'm getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and\nTwenty twenty now I in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital of first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nFresh in everybody's minds go after him on perjury and sexual harassment\nNot\nI mean serious serious things for which\nA conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital and they added all the other things\nOn Trump this is my guest that they would go after Kavanaugh first ... ... that meant Gorsuch state would leave alone Gorsuch\nShift the balance of McCord cabin on does [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster Arizona Republican Senator Jeff flake\nSays unless something big changes he'll vote yes on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation Maine Republican Susan Collins is showing down to her voted three o'clock eastern gas from her would be enough even though it looks like Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski will vote no she voted today against ascending judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate\nTops in a Republican Chuck Grassley said before that the one forty nine vote\nIn a previous era\nIs highly qualified nominee would have received unanimous support in the Senate\nCalifornia Democrat Dianne
