but on the way back\nHe tweets on his on his airplane or just him in the Trump had and he tweets something about ah you know\nAbolish the thirteenth amendment and the left goes crazy\nAnd they're just all about how is he was during sleep see that's what Trump people are like they want to bring slavery back really\nReally you don't play that game I can understand that from conservatives but do me a favor I just want you to Google thirteenth amendment Huffington Post see how many stories come up\nThat is not about abolishing slavery that is about saying that we never abolished slavery the thirteenth amendment was just a ruse that we went from the plantation to the prisons\nThat what that meant she's talking about prison reform and everybody on the left knows it every one let me\nUp because he has the Trump had uh they're gonna act act as if that is that when I was going to American guy was wavering slavery which is just so dishonest and I've always felt that it is interesting that that the thirteenth amendment did not\nOutlaw slavery is it neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime wherever the party has been convicted shell exist when the

the like some of the stuff Trump is doing but this is not a conservative argument by any means you're not an ideological conservative no more but he is I mean that's his\nLanguage of saying we need prison reform alegria I think we need prison reform to and the generic statement right yeah and not perfect but he's\nLosing the raise into why the left is getting away with a you know making his tweet look\nRacist is because they they know this language he's using their language\nRight and again shows that they don't care about the issue as much as they care about political power the fact he's supporting their far left viewpoint yes right this is is echoing a far left rally in quite a crowd of activists yet and they'd rather traction because of the ...\nRight that shows the depth of this right and this is all about power again it's not about the principal you think you think the left cares about prison reform\nKanye West and his wife have done now more with Donald Trump on prison

today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer\nThan I maybe forty five minutes I'm\nIn an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions from the Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocated he wasn't just announcing the deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most\nPart are clueless uh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies\nAnd Trump stood up and said there's no reason that we should have our back pockets picket\nThere's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy at doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having the it was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other\nType people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process\nAnd in discussing this substance and the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as announcing is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this caught that cut this reform that reform a lot of people to know what they were talking I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen all this Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us [noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr to earn the\nRespect of others it's up to us just show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump's turning this a hundred and eighty

accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find out what are you there was Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we\nAre made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know our name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written in the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public so people\nWere trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have taught her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's so unfair it starts button light and it\nBecame obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of the letter one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine balls e for a new it's seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned\nShe eventually asked for point of order the German Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[noise]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned

you look at ... she turns back to the camera wait a minute like Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy saying oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and asked to undergo his seven\nTo be I background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter and they own nor nor was it was with us\nShe turns back around so we we didn't do it unless the German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic\nJust like what

insisting he's not limiting the scope of the review just deferring to the Senate\nThere's even a little story this developed about the uh her use of safe way\nThat she shopped in safe way a lot and

can't even tell them where to look she can't tell them when to walk\nUnless she starts suddenly remembering it now and I guess they would say that that's credible the trauma as awakened repressed

and they didn't smart the memory beds I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats 'cause okay fine we we we we got what we

the people calling him or not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic\nMike intention to you is that the me too movement alone\nHas no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accused guys that have mistreated them it's not a new phenomenon it's not something\nFor which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is it the tail end of this new awareness and sensitivity\nAnd yet\nIt's being spoken of Christine mostly for his testimony on her inspiration is being spoken of as though it's a stand alone and it's never happened before and that adds to her credibility though don't you see\nAnd I think we're all being played oh yeah I Do know I'm not accusing I'm\nNot saying women coming forward I'm saying it's not a new thing that they

thankful to Dr Ford because she has given me the courage to ... the me too movement\nNot work on um the me too movement not give them courage\n\nJust think we're being played here folks\nUm [noise]\nAnd of course it gives flights covered for what he has done it\nComes up to be a hero yeah we need more information we need more yeah what's wrong with more information\n[noise] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites\nThese are from the oval office was during a an announcement ceremony for\nA new trade deal eliminating NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal the drive by as were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA\nStarted entertaining the are the questions and what we have one true good four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin on things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls that are on very accurate [noise] we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states so they end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was gonna win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia Vega\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's been out of bed statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me ... let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise]\n... this whole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flake was not gonna vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are thanks to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing his level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr ... needs to go two weeks to go to waste some of the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nThe Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be ... and they're going to demand even more\nAnd just fix the fact that it was rigged\nThey're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why did they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nUh let's see let's let's skip forward here to um [noise] audio soundbite number thirty reporter about

to\nThis after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is going to have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where\nOr when whatever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promote it\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody on the Senate\nJudiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vowed Jang for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not\n\nSomebody look we've got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and go home\n\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it\nHe did no such thing but he sure felt for the bait I Am not limited to thing I've totally FBI to take us wherever it takes them\nProperly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want you to the doctor\n\nIf you called the FBI and say hey look there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about an IRS in that when you go talk to them that doesn't work that way does it\n\nNot rush rush this is the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise] and one of the thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen that go go watch it's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was you know rush ...\nHe's the guy but you know drug ... the East
