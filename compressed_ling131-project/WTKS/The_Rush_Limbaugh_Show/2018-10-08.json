dirty little secret but it's something to\nAlways keep in mind and frankly I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because it's a point that's been true for as long as I have been doing this program in the longer we say constantly to the left uses the courts\nTo act as insurance policies against losing elections that the left cannot\nSucceed in implementing his agenda nationwide except to be the courts\nAnd that's why the courts are so important and that's why the courts a liberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts federal appellate courts\nAs they can with leftist activist judges not just plain old simple judges a rule of law and there is a dirty little secret behind this\nFolks\nThe Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress they do not\nThe numbers to implement and pass\nTheir agenda legislatively other words they cannot get their beliefs their ideas past as the laws in America they have to rely on activists jobs just to do it\nNow you might miss it was Russia or heard you say that before nothing new there well there's nothing new about it but particularly its in its relevance its power and it's important has been magnified in this current Kevin a fight and explains in one reason\nWhy why this is so important to them they are in their minds on the verge of losing the highest court in the land there on the verge of losing the ability\nTo have the highest court in the land a rubber stamp their policies if you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue\nThat these issues that have royals our culture turned our culture upside down you won't find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court and any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hey\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every that this is the\nPoint what they believe in\nThe idea is they have must be forced on the rest of the bus if they are to happen\nThey cannot withstand legislative tests\nIt's the same reason why every Democrat president up to and including Obama never tells the truth about they were in town that they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about but why Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was going to cost you running ... he would have never been elected\nAnd no Democrat ever wouldn't be\nThey routinely soft sell what they really believe they do not come out an advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns they will do it as it was a case of a Alexandria or if you're going to ask\nWho is one of the on display in a leftist district to New York is harmless but you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it\nWe have not lost this country and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding but the left once everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust unfair\nThat it is also racist and sexist and besides you to stick in all these other things that are despicable we must do away with it\nThey don't have the ability to to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this everything they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare\nHas been forced on the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you they try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you\nThis is not the behavior that does when things legislatively and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this giant ... blue wave and I don't care even today\nThere are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on them you're going to find a story saying yeah it's over Democrats when and when bang\nAnd even the Republicans think so a P has them Reuters has some\nNew York times CNN doesn't matter where you go there's always going to be a story where Republicans agree it's over the Republican is definitely afraid Republican scared to death no way they can resist that coming blue wave\nSorry don't buy it may happen

do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and their power their products no power\nCan be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact is is strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate means do ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet and I don't know if it was so much that white women supported Kevin ... is that they were ... it it scared to death at what

with that exact point may the\nHere and I think I moved to the bottom of the stuck but it\nIs it is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong is as good as guilty because he\nCould have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could\nThey just change tactics and the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine balls before they had to ... they had someone that not only educates argued\nThat someone that was wanting to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have Trump who cannot who has put so much the on the spine of Republicans\nAre ... true true but maybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to is willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized the Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make he rose out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that is going to be turned off by it\nAnd want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar\nClass and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these types of issues but I think largely the that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think that Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn my saying and just world the Democrats are just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king book titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this monkey ... for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this\nBut I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election the Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\n\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people going to be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energize I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by the end actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just have to chuckle um\nThat I

Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena in a place in whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in a plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down at nine Trent Lott into boys all\nShowed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial ... their former colleague Paul Wellstone they worm food and bullied and harassed\nOut of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down it was identical\nTo what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the we're the Republicans were seated in getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing after\nThey thought they were there to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast\nA hate fast aimed at George W ... a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial this Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms occur\nI remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for\nElection night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted and I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycled\nOther people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard of\n\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just clicked and at the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully theirs Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen to Republicans gained ...\nSeats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's unlike ... if it's happened once it can happen again\nSomething that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has\nThen it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too
