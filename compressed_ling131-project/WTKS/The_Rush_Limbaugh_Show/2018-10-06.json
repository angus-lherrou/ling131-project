to hear a and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was\nLaying them out for the lying trickster Zen skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party which uh\nWe do with all the time I hear but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about me as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory Spartacus Booker to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and find that uh what do you live with Feinstein if you'll recall\nToward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her ... most of note ringer it's so unfair it starts button light and\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of the letter one would be Senator Feinstein and or her staff the other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers\nFor Christine malls before and it would seem the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and that was all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually asked for point of order\nThe German Grassley and and ... a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this out rate just allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just ask my staff I just asked my staff at any of them later and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter]\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't her what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we didn't make it\nBut we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy saying oh is this how we're going to determine who leaked something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no corroboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein guess will turn around and ask her staff hey did any of you leak this letter and they won't nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it with German\nAs though case closed it wasn't us they had done it it was strategic\nJust like what happened on friday was to teach strategic\nLadies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that a Kurd last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened

poll and mayor even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the

Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host have been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nLet me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I I Know of one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have more fun we're going to watch a horse race had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that's why you Drew's on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bats and that'll ... starts the tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer bats tell me it was gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops and at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHave the final turn ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional ... or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much ... resumes tape to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape there is no way\nAnybody could have known after first turn at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is going to win yet look what you want to do what you were making bets you bring guessing some of your probably were certain the bottom line\nIs finish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January in front of ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none zilch zero not up\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or type thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why\nThey had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've\nHad this in in in the in the can it's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of ... out\nNow all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final her in and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August\nWe don't know anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high\nAnd the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything\nThat production of mine went viral and Dr buys loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P in their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible\nThat's when they run the sound bites me predicting in all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with\nThat and they wrote now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite is just\nThe exact opposite why all of this attention on Capitol on what the Republican is actually going to help them how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people will like Kevin I'll go down that are really fire 'em up that will fire buddy you know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news buttresses some of this from the hill dot com red state Democrats faced nightmare scenario on cabinet\nThis article shows beyond that\nThe Democrats have brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations announce cabinet you realize the\nLatest defense in New York Times has run the story saying that Brett Kavanaugh through ice on a ... bar patron back in his days that you ate all\nHe threw ice this\nGoes to show just how on fit for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is\nOf course the New York times when the learning that Bill Clinton told Juanita Broderick put a little ice on your lips Bab while walking out of the room after allegedly raping her they thought that was not worthy of being published are printed that wasn't enough to that I mean put some ice on that live there that\nThat no news there but Kavanaugh throwing ice allegedly on a ... page would stop the presses the guy is evil he is not qualified\nSo all these unfounded sexual allegations they hope ultimately what all this has been about hoping to force Kevin ought to drop out that's what they have just just like\nThe mother investigation Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trump's approval numbers on the Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support\nWashington by Republicans that they could get his approval numbers now to the twenties because they succeeded make everybody think Trump cheated with the Russians in trouble and lose all support as Nixon did in the Watergate era and have to resign that was the objective\nBecause there's no way they were going to impeach Trump to know where the mother investigation is going to lead the Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with him\nWhat they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign\nFrom the nomination withdraw or to force Trump to withdraw that and the way they still hope that they can force capital out\nA second Democrat is from the article here but he'll docked on the second Democrat Senator said there's widespread disbelief in the caucuses Kavanaugh is holding\nMore than anything the joy I get is helping them understand this is just the beginning of the

denying every day and then they're denying that they're calling the shots are they denying expanding the scope and Trump did not expand ... simply reacted at a rally to what the media is saying\nYou

know what I mean that's the only thing I remember [noise]\nAnd a man my visiting Saturn a man's life is shattered\nNow that is not marketing for word mocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge her she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they\nPlayed right along and without had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the\nTime we were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was um\nAll Trump is still just reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people\nShe says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences\nIn her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking Kristin ball the Ford now Trump has a lot of people saying this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible\nAnd her testimony was compelling I have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah\nI'll agree with that that gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling them as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use that he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord what did he say\nClimate change of are serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you what do you think's really thinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stab wished\nAfter he makes it an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you ... irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made the with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nHe just simply pushy she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why you're not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine a man organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women you can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of meat to\nWill rush or a million women or nor do there should we do well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not\nAbout even ban and set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made fun up in the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democratic party is and so that's what Democrats senators have said that the accused tests to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that real\nNews radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve\nSo bad with the only law\nShow let's go to the phones I've got the suburban women story I'll save it for just a second I got I got to the phones within an hour and a half I'm Sorry folks ah this is Brian St Augustine Florida really really really appreciate your waiting thank you\nThank throw a quarter to save at our Kavanaugh you can go for all of the women who have sexual your fault but were afraid or embarrassed to report it\nUh well I knew you may have a ... I I I think you're you're right along you're right in line with one of my new found\nTheories and it's actually not a new found theory what it is is a very late arrival on my part of being able to verbalize\nYou've you've heard over the years liberalism mental diseases are all kinds of ... and I thought that that that's too simplistic and besides it's not effective I mean even if it's true it's not going to be effective say that\nBut that doesn't erase the fact that we're dealing with some genuine in comprehensible emotional problems on the part of these people and I have to give credit where credit's\nDue it was a little blurb by Jim guarantee at National Review that caused the explosion of brain some apps is in the frontal lobe beer he said\nI'm paraphrasing it'll have a right in front of me but he said I don't even think this is what I I think psychological disorders people the psychological disorders have become liberals in politics at that that that that psychological disorders\nPeople who have them have brought their disorders into politics and rather than just a singular thing had happened to them they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them\nExactly what liberalism and has become and that's where we agree [noise] tell you\nMobile whether there will be plenty of sunshine for your outdoor activities today it will

now more Raasch radio Ninety seven boys seven to twelve ... so that\nYou're listening to Russia's weak in review\nReadings and welcome back Rush Limbaugh the ivy network books the areas the IRS the James we've done the gym and guarantee quotes\nFrom a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them under the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together it's one of the rare\nMoments I was unable to this is exactly right we're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that ... or the individual that did something can be made to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible and so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nThat's sick ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various\nAgendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American\nCapitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in\nFor men who have abused every woman out there he's right balls the Ford\nWill end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think\nWith black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem\nA all cops are bad every white cop as of right every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in on fairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these compliance\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe disputes the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls
