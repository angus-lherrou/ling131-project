I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure um so you know you talk about the history of it we know basically what goes on now so how do you see since you studied it so much can you really continue to do that how do you see the future of Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\nWell a an ethical your question you know I think that um you know\nHalloween mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we're with each\nInteract with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far in Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's there's like arson and stuff it's like scary scary stuff going on\nUm but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that that there's a certain innocence about it\nBut I think he's really appealing again it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion\nIt's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum ... who does like to dress up we all like to dress up right I mean eight year old kid of just eighty year old kid like dress up and so it's there's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors and asking for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a goat or you've\nGot like holographic oh you've got to that you got to see that it was this giant thing that'd be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're gonna are asking about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is will is we tonight\nNever missed a detail or short just sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\nSeven point six o'clock\nA tremendous victory I'm camp who sales Fox News that President Trump described the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nHe will proudly\nAlongside justice Neil Gorsuch\nHe was he came from ... county extension out of ... he had treated without the darned down there came to Boone county in the mid Nineteen nineties brought the idea for it and it was funded than a Mr Amman are late Mr Richard Amman or did the design work the system of getting it going\nAbout Nineteen Ninety six troop klansmen oh yeah here in the game and so\nI I was told it from ...\nJust in passing I I got to meet him a couple of\nTimes when I had a ... as far as the plants and back in the seventies I mean he was like yeah you could tell you know here's designs because you didn't recognize any plants that were there\nI mean he just unbelievable Florence small right yeah you know that we had a bellwether nursery okay but the I think the biggest thing a lot of folks don't know about the cameras he did kings island yeah yeah he went in there on horseback and actually selected trees and got laid out\nWithin the weather is also when I say to exist some of the ... and yeah so he actually backed out of his business for a while and spent all this time of their planning all the Russian olives that are still\nThey know that we didn't know back then you know yeah there's lots of\nYoung I was a guy and yeah I Would come into the rhythm and there'd be a pilot plant yeah almost every week like here try this try this\nThe end up you know what you just looked at it when I moved\nHere is that his house on the on the nursery ground just it'll phenomenal yeah but we have it's early in our breed it ended up as a ...\nYeah yeah um so yeah so you've been around about Twenty years and you you came in there\nIn a two thousand and two so I've been there about sixteen of those twenty right and it's still growing still growing constantly we got hundreds of plants to buy this fall\nAnd you're always welcome volunteers I Know you guys have ...

percent of a certified harbors that become board certified\nMass actually that's a great that's a great thing and we're very very proud of you for doing that and and being at that level and of course you've been a meteorologist a hobby meteorologist since you were three\nBut almost exactly a year ago became a official National Weather service cooperative observers semi observation\n... are now going to the official record so that's pretty cool but Chris you're also under the weather\nI Am yeah I just thought you did last night I did not just the other spotter from Wilmington office\nOkay now why don't you coming to\nWilmington covers the whole region oh is that what it is yeah oh it's like he's almost out\nOf the nice thing about the cooperatives everything has actually had meteorologist come over to the house and make sure the placement of the instruments were correct and I have a thermometer now that's National Weather service equipment so it's nice to have them when you're weather buff they have meteorologist visiting your house like\nIt's almost like being our culture buff and Scott ... visiting your house you know it's digging up\nYour plan [laughter] cutting off of that [laughter] for the idea\nNow you were wrong was all excited 'cause he told me you got to snowboard yeah I said I didn't think you are much of a snowboarder or skier but come to find out really wasn't a snowboard\nIt's a it's a ... borders the board that's placed out any measure the snow fall on that board set\nSo Scott it gets a piece of wood and you just put it outside and then you measure the snow falls on the would well actually ... officials snowboard I got a grant from the national weather service\nOn air oh I Know it is it couldn't do that at Christmas what it is yeah well I'm not that impressed and it's just you know as a\n... guys will [laughter]\nAnd then we go to Scott beer line ... botanical garden and do you guys do a great job yeah all the class and everybody else does and you got one coming up here again yeah the native plants opposing village of member tense tickets sell out like in a flash yeah everybody enjoys them yeah this is the last one\nSort out six weeks early that was just amazing uh this one I don't know I put it off for the past week so I'll go in a Monday and see where we stand but we were about half full last time I checked cool yeah\nSo what anything new at the botanical garden\nUp both seasons just about to just start up so\nAh everybody you know I Am still plan that up no Brian said most entirely out at the forum now busy yeah secure and Tosh of taken over the age did you have anything to do with it uh no but I'm very happy about it why figured he would be yeah I'd say I almost never see 'em any more I was just great right but I figured you were maybe wind that somehow ah\nNo I I have to fight it I've I've worked with every major you know ... top brass down there to get him fired and it won't happen she's got dirt on all levels really ... that's the only possible you know to say about somebody walks around with a camera with the twelve foot lens hanging yeah for yeah just he's such a show off yeah so yeah\nSo anyway we love going down there and I know that the Everytime thing Maynard says it says that he's a botanical garden in the back of his head he's really saying the botanical gardens\nYeah yes to catch them so I I ... just a couple of yeah it's almost a year so we're working on them I think it's going to happen to like be five years down the road or something but we got a couple of people to bore down on it will get\nYeah All right we're going to take a break when we come back we're going to kick it off with the ah why plant trees and then we're going to keep going we've got all kinds of

he has an embarrassing himself you know I think he's he's All right so far Ron what do you think\nHow I'd give him a pretty good grade\nPretty good so far so we're talking about why planting trees are next we want to take a look at and I think you're going to hit on us but all of you did in the last segment mistakes that we make choosing and planting trees\nBecause I think that's one of the biggest things that we talk about what people were turned off is the mistakes I always say first I'll start it off\nPeople complain all the time about the tree line companies going out do or whatever ... all the branches away from the tree lines right or the ... or whatever well you know they have the right to do that for the right away and if one has branches found your life because that you'll be all upset right but yet everybody complains about that but I look back and say\nThe person to blame is who the person who planted the thirteenth they planted the tree there now obviously some of those are natural trees and came up and didn't have anything to do with it but in many cases we're the ones that plant 'em there in the first place so the finger should be pointed at right there person the planet\nSo let's talk about mistakes that we make choosing and planting trees in our yards\nSo location and writes the season the right spot a boon county are ready to go through and look at a utility line demonstration area to show you what types of trees to plant near power lines if you have to have them nearby Arlen\nYou one of the big mistakes is is people don't do enough research when they're buying a tree are planning a tree you know in some ways you should look into it I was like you would buy a car because it's something that's going to be an incredibly valuable for you\nOh for very long period of time um and it doesn't you don't have to go to the library and hit the Internet all that so much just go to a nursery a good nursery or two year extension office or go to a class\nOr how 'bout boon county arboretum botanical gardens who\nYeah any public garden is is always a good resource for this stuff\nOr spring Grover you see two hundred year early spring growth that I think that's the other is to have a lot of those labeled too yeah I mean rather than the voices\nRather than kind of looking at the full scope and considering the options fully I think a lot of people will just look at what their neighbors got say oh I like that I wanted you know\nBut there's so many trees out there that that you can perhaps hatchery isn't the best treat for you [noise] um it's all about location it's about your soil it's about your moisture\nUm [noise] and the space that you've got you know what trees are available\nAnd the you know the the resource that since then botanical gardens who has a plant places website we have that link from our website at Arbor Dr dot com\nWhere you know you can actually see pictures of these trees and landscapes mature sizes\nWhat they're going to look like I can name trees all day long but when you can actually look at him\nAnd see what they look like one big mistake I see a lot as with river purchase for example because I think what happened this for years people plan and white birch as they find them right up against their foundation practically they die before they got they got old enough to become a huge problem because they don't do well in a hotter climate all the time\nAnd then people came back and say well let's replace it with a river birch what's gets forty or fifty feet tall and wide and they plan that five the same place at one of the white\nBirch Eighteen Inches off the off the foundation exactly you know ... ... you can't do that well you can oh you can but you should do anything you want to go back\nTo and I get I get this all the time and that throws that people um my biggest first thing is\nThink about the mature size of the tree not height so much because you'd sky's the limit the width of the tree look it up and see if it's a twenty if it gets twenty or thirty feet in diameter would give it another ten feet\nAnd then calculate that away from your house or waving the property line or whatever it may be so we we don't do that we plant that autumn leaves maple six feet in from the property line for is that going to be eventually\nShaking your neighbor's house as well or we planted Fifteen feet from the er ten the from the house where's it going to be ... years down the road\nRon when I bought my house in Burlington I had a noise Bruce to foot from on dates and other quarter about passed out about the house are saying it was cut the tree to what you cut it down it was twenty foot it was already ... front in front of the house up out\nYeah one one one infrastructure thing that people don't think about is is how wide the trunks going to get in and say well it's a it's a four foot tree lawn between the sidewalk on the street and it's going to be a three foot\nDiameter tree so there's plenty of room for it but the actual equation that you should he is is it the route flare cause it flares out into the root system is going to be about three times what the Trump sizes so it's going to be a two foot tree you really need\nAt least six feet of a a space there are for that route flare war it's going to start pushing sidewalks up and things like that I\nPersonally think and I think I brought this up the last show we had that you should not be allowed to plant street trees in an area that's less than six to eight feet from the sidewalk to the street yeah\nThere's always get that three and four foot gap you know I mean you know is it ain't gonna work it just doesn't work and plus that tree is right up again goes now use ... an example now some of those ... and some of the street are starting to get some size to them they looked like this like a tunnel where\nThe the trucks go through in sheer off all of the branches because they are planted two and a half feet off of the street off the curb I don't I you know with a gun on the other side of the sidewalk would've been a different story\nAnd one thing I've seen him do in some of the suburban areas they'll have an eight foot maid in or something down the middle but I guess it looks cute architecturally to have him stagger though what the the first trade has planted two feet or one foot from the curb on one side and that's on the one foot from the company as I said they're not ... leaving any room for that flare whatsoever\nEven though he likes to use those as yeah close you can get to them and you're going to live as long as ... as curbs on both sides [laughter] see how we get close you can\nOr the other big problem we see is a poor planting so too deep way too high and then of course then we add onto that by two feet of mulch multiple again is so those are my big pet peeves I drive around town seeing that sort of thing\nIt's the weather here ... irritates me the most because you know there's never been any professional academic like recommendations to mulch highlight that is every group has said for ... that's going to harm the tree so the people\n... other that kind of looks like that thing in England they do where they they run with a big ball of cheese touted hell have you ever see that one no uh yeah there is like a six foot ball of making it they don't do as a wedding hall is she thinks he's been on vacation\nThey looked like wheels we'll achieve yeah hard to stand up comedy routines has already cheesy to me that they said they're rolling\nDown a hill and Wales I think in these all these truck I a a British people are running around with it and falling and getting run over and\nEuropeans do strange things through the tomatoes each other they throw heritage that going\nOn [laughter] yeah there's all kinds of weird things they do with berets and their parents yeah have you heard that one nah I had a crazy yeah they see how they can stand it well before they ... they get it out\nTalking with the trade goes Chris stone run robbed is got to be on the line from St really a couple of quick things here and work and\nThey were going to fly through the next segment with or without chopped choices which is coming up so if you want to hear what the all three of them had to choose where they're large shade trees medium ornamental trees in their favor tree get your pen and paper ready to do that after the top of the hour a couple of things real quick evergreen situation out there right now\nSerious situation larger evergreens struggling yeah\nEddie ... blues and aren't I mean\nI mean is taking over from the white white pine are doing better than ... ... what are you guys see and what are you recommending\nIf white pine are properly sided I I I Love white pine ... but you can't just stick it in a heavy clay soil and Burma new subdivision than expected growth backed into ... but I mean it's a forest tree so it needs good soil needs\nA decomposing organic matter it it probably does better in ... when it has some other trees around it with a slightly cooler micro climate\nI mean that's where it grows and nature and I still like that but the ... situation and every other call I get his for declining are dying blue springs yeah it's a it's an environmental I mean the trees native to the higher elevations in the Rockies that doesn't get a hundred degrees up there Ninety degrees up there much vent thirty eight Ninety degree days of summer\nA and needle cast disease a fungal diseases is really hitting them hard so you know I I I Can't recommend blue springs anymore and Norway spurious which has some problems seems to be doing a lot better\nI think it's hanging in there yeah when I see for the most part are coming back at Norway's Bruce again\nIt already is Britain's All right as long as you water them and those really bad drought years if\nYou're a granddaughter ... true of all evergreens whether it's already or whatever maybe yeah you got to water on and yeah and it doesn't rain\nI on such a hit and what was it two thousand seven or yes they did a Ninety probably half the blues cruise ship to the region were killed by that somewhere a loaded and the rest were ... to the point where they died the following a couple of\nYears to find the white pine it's it's not white pines not this drove us it's a\nThis planet I buy your entrance to Korea Korea and yeah or\nThe there's also the um it's just you're a vendor ... pyramid\nWell yeah that that's not a flexible as I'm not going to ...\n... ... yeah\nBut I thought it was like a white pine it says the was showing me\n... or ... whatever that is a form of ... after like by yeah yeah the ... pies doing quite well that would that look pretty good yeah yeah it's not that white pine but it's look pretty hilarious similar and uh yeah it seems to be handling yeah poor sites for us really well\nBut if you want to replace the for blues versus Colorado was Bruce I hear bill fountain my former president UK screaming at me it's not believed Bruce Christ it's tolerable is Bruce [noise]\nUm [noise] is uh the Orioles Bruce if you talk to the guys you know Brian Hynes over spring Grover a day Grassley they're going to say well and that oh seven drought you know they lost probably a hundred Norris bruised and they ... or ... asking\nHim out of work hard was Orientals a sailor do long time to get on the size we'll try to sell them to somebody major cloudy plant is very expensive days I should\nNarrow with selling a lot that a lot of people are looking for it's hard\nTo find and a lot of people want a larger trade when the planet and you know it it's almost impossible to find in my in my experience in a larger size\nBut it does excellent and landscapes and other things interesting about it is it does really well in shade and so I mean if you if you need a ... for a shady situation it does really well in that situation do or as your other ... versus Norway and\nNorway doesn't do as well and ... doesn't do it was well anywhere so\nMaybe we can increase the market need that we talked about this morning with the oriental yeah it's\nA beautiful day and the interesting thing on spring grove is even though it's slow the other it's slow when it's younger uh they pointed out that it seems like a catches up over time you know in size it just starts out slow slow which makes it a\nChallenge to grow you have frustrating for nurseries to grow that because it it you know you can get a ... a blues Bruce to market size in three or four years probably and an oriental spruce you may have to double that\nOf course we are seeing spring grove and green giant or revive Beatty yes very fast growing really coming into the market big time now yeah and then there's another one I just saw it was called sport\nStays little just a little bit smaller\nA new the introduction out there for a but again I think we are seeing that really started I mean we can't grow it from either one of\nThe we used to be careful not to play too much of one thing or try to mix you're planting up with the various things speaking of which diversity among\nThe boarding a plane of diversity in ... oh yeah dirty ... you know\n'cause I I mean people people have all ashtrays and lost all the trees with them arrest or you know the maple trees out in and the vessel area where the ... with the Asian longhorn beetle has been a problem lose all their maple trees out there\nSo yeah I mean if you put all your eggs in one basket you could be losing everything\nYou might already bears New York\nDecided haired one that got cut down pretty quickly well that's two trees you cut down a knee pretty quickly mhm oh I got more than that though that health I had I repairs and all the good ...\nGood to do a you know we were\nJust to save the technical garden a Jew [noise]\nWe have so many different players forbid those divides perennials tree shrubs everything\nAh thirty five
