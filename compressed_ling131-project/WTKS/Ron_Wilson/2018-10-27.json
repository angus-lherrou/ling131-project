job\nNow may I answer the phone just rang it go\nThe phone phone lines are open at eight hundred eight to three to five five anyway uh we had a a several emails this week\nAnd it always happens we have someone on a we're talking about a book a good book that's out there a will be a good couldn't catch the name of the author of the book where do I go find it a just a reminder for the folks that they couldn't remembers called garden renovation transforming your yard into the garden of your dreams and it's by Bobby Schwartz\nHer website is Bee Gees thumb\nA Bee Gees thumb dot com as and Bobby's green thumb dot com and you could buy it on her website you can also buy that Amazon and places like that as well but again it was called garden renovation and this was a it's a really cool book because what she does that's especially as a landscape designer\nThere goes into homes that have existing landscapes and it's a tough thing to do I mean I was it was a diner designer for several years and\nGoing into a house and was brand new with a clean pallet was so much easier than going into a house and they had him existing landscape and trying to work with and I'm saving plans now you know you you would just easier um but she likes the just the opposite she likes to go in with an existing landscape work with it\nAnd then trying to achieve your goals I'm your designed the types of gardens that you'd like to have with the old landscape it's already there and change things around and it's a really cool book says he has a lot of pictures of what she said I think only\nThe almost three hundred pictures about ten of 'em are weren't hers and all the rest were but just she addresses literally everything in your yard sidewalks\nPorches decks sheds fences screen plant things outdoor rooms she addresses the mall\nAnd great pictures and a great easy read but it's so it's a wonderful book and uh and that's why we had her on but again it's called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams her website is be G thumb dot com eight hundred a two three eight to five five Gemini Ohio good morning\nWanting Ron How are you good sorority yourself oh too early to tell [laughter] so uh what they could try to use a plane ticket to be bringing indoors for the winter time to keep the bugs out\nTwo things I look at I'm Glad you brought that up because it was a little tip we wanted to share today two things I look at it as far as protecting and one is I Try to do everything I Can't outside before I bring him inside and try to knock off as much as we can\nPose in them off with a strong stream of water really takes a lot of bugs off your plants and I'll typically do insecticide all soap\nAs the last ... re before I bring it back inside now you can also do\nA systemic insecticide if you wish\nAnd you can do that before you bring an inside as well so it's you know it sprinkled into the soil water in so that's something you can do before you bring in and and when you go to your local garden center they'll have a systemic ... insecticide specifically\nFormulated for indoor plants and then must say for indoor plants and that's out there a bond I'd has the right thing for them has a and an insecticide all soap I think is your real key to I'm taking care of bugs once you get them inside the house\nTo fold insecticide also so organic all natural so that's a good thing and and the thing about insecticide all ... you got to remember in only kills what you spray it on so if there's nobody there doesn't kill anything\nSo you have to you know if you see the route break you get the insecticides soap out your your spray everything it kills what you spray it on so between the all that systemic insecticide this up inside the plant\nAnd your insecticide also during the outside of the plant\nReally does a nice job keeping under control one last thing I suggest to gym for smaller plants that are maybe eight inch pots are smaller if you can get them into the kitchen sink or utility tub\nIf about every three weeks or so you take those and turn them on their side and just really ransom off with lukewarm water again I go back to the spraying plants off when you're outside that knocks might soften it knocks aphids off it makes a mock sing a lot of things off and put some right down the drain\nWithout using any insects as it says sons as insecticides and also systemic insecticide in the soil insecticide also a me memorials available some folks like to use that as well but I liked insecticide also\nAnd then renting them off every three or four or five weeks you do all that stuff you pretty well can keep it under control and I always keep a um one or two things either an old shower curtain around because you can lay down on the floor which plants in\nThe middle of an spray them if you need to protect the floor you know also use those um pans that you use that he put under your car if you like drain in the oil and that that looks like a huge cookie sheet\nReally work really nice to and then you put it on that you don't get it on anything else so those are my three things for keeping bugs under control once you get 'em in the house\nOne more question or if you're", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "city": "Savannah", "day": "27"}
