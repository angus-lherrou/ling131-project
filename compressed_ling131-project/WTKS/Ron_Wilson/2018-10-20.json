in the upper sixties don't forget our free WTO's the weather out where you can continue to get your first learn whether I'm Ron Wallace\nHe savannah is news radio now seven points to have an F ... twelve ... am Devon Eugene chaos [noise]\n\n\nWelcome back here to guide with Ron Wilson talking with George Chris out in Georgetown about is a boost Bruce let me ask you this Chris over the years that new growth now just a new growth on the ends still the same link that it's always been still putting out a lot of new growth\nFor your heart on air got it right or completely bare it after the Arab brand like out there right [noise]\nCouple of things can happen you know nutrient deficiency is the first falls remember this evergreens lose their needles on the inside it's a natural thing that they do and if you look at pines for instance look at the white pine they only had needles from this year's growth sometimes last year's but that's it and they lose everything to the inside\nThe good thing about spruce trees for the most part is that they'll keep their needles about three or four years back so they look for all the way back into the to the plant itself\nSo a lotta times you know you don't notice that but occasionally they will lose those needles all the way out to the new growth\nIt's typically not a good thing it's usually a sign that for some reason whatever it may be the plant may be under some kind of stress it could be um\nCould be dealing with um might issues ah which can cause the Beatles to kind of model and then they drop off early um you know those types of things can happen if the new growth looks good very flush very good coming out good that's a good sign that means that the tree is you know\nIt is is doing okay it's just that for some reason you're losing those inter needles now what you may want to do is\nTake some of the ... ... any needles that are still left on some of those branches to the inside take some of those off and take them to a local garden center unless somebody look at the needles themselves sometimes they can detect whether it's some might issue maybe a nutrient deficiency whatever may be\nBut that's a possibility now if you get into individual branch is\nStarting to die on the plants which we are seeing a blue spruce now it's a it's a needle disease it causes those ... the whole branch to fall off and turn brown and then eventually you know you wind up having to cut it off I Hope you don't get into that but that's going around out there right now so you know it's several things but the the bottom line is is\nWe've got to take a look at some of those old needles to take a look and try to determine what's causing those to drop\nSo if you can get samples to somebody to let them look at 'em that's going to be your best bet\nAnd take a couple of pictures of the blues cruise overall up close you know look at the new growth overall picture and didn't take those needles so local garden center left somebody look at that for you to try to determine what may be going on are you able to water those when you're in a dry situation\nWell you know we've got a lot of training that share a I have a ... minute I've ever water\nYeah yeah and I said the wallet right that is what I'm going to\nGo up there yeah fake it over how the other one that was always a quarter but power then right\nIn and out yup inspected inspected trunk make sure you don't see anything on the trunk\nUm other than that I Can't you know without seeing the trio itself I can give you any other suggestions or without seeing it and that's going to be the bottom line trying to get an I look at those needles and trying to figure out what's going on how much new growth is put out and and go from there how tall are they did you say Fifteen twenty feet\nYeah they are quite\nA if if nobody can come up with an answer just showing the needles you may want to invest\nIn a fee to have a certified or risk come to the site and take a look at and that sort of you know that's an investment you want to make sure you don't lose and that may be the best thing for you to get somebody out there right on the site to take a look at um determine what else may be done to help switch back around again\nYeah hey don't\nWell I Would no I didn't say anything about beetles I said look at the trunk for any other issues that may be out there but mites\nCould be an issue could be I'm just saying could be a which can cause some of those in her needles to drop off more so than others um if the plants under stress it'll drop those needles more so than others like I say they naturally shed those anyway\nBut for some reason that one's doing it more than the other one which means that there's something else going on with the tree might issue ... disease issue stretches you whatever may be but somebody's going to take a look at those old needles and try to determine what that may be\nYeah I probably won't get all made up for after you're all wrong it\nLook around there yeah look around the base of maybe you can pick up some around the base maybe even sacrifice one of the small tips of the brands that has the show has the needles on it\nOr that you can take along with you as well so am I could take a look at that too but somebody's got to see something to try to determine but again they naturally shed those leave news needles anyway but typically not that to the tip not to spruce and that just some reasons for some reason it's been stressed might disease\nDrought heat whenever may be\nA but that's cause it to do that more than than it normally should do that\nIf I'm In the fertilizer trees what would I Do\nUm you know you get ... you could use a Ross route feeder that would inject is a water soluble fertilizer into this to root system\nYou could even take something and drill holes around the drip line of the tree and and the poor little ten ten ten or twelve twelve twelve and they're very lightly and those holes the kind of feed that way you can even top dressed underneath the the us Bruce for that but again that's not necessarily the answer\nYou know it's a disease or whatever [noise] that's the first thing you want to go after the you know otherwise a tree maybe doing great\nWith a new growth and have plenty of nutrients and not need to be fed we need to find out what the other reasons are\nOkay All right well that's what I'll do it\nAll right Chris them if you do find that let me know because I certainly like to hear back from ... to see what the word finds out but again\nRemember in this time of year you'll see evergreen starting to shed needles on the inside it's natural that happens and boy sometimes ... can scare the heck out of you because they lose everything right up to this year's growth or can and when they do that especially white pine Austrian playing with those longer needles they get that golden yellow\nAnd you know you're in an all those needles or yellow on the inside ... turned yellow on the inside um the spruce turning yell you know that scares the heck out of you when you see that\nBut realizing that they do this naturally and as long as this to the inside of not to the tips", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "city": "Savannah", "day": "20"}
