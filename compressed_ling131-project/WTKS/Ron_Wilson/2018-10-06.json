but it's always a lot of fun so say too but that coming up in our next hour coming up after the break Ron Ron with us your doctor will join us early\nWants to talk about we're going to talk about planting new trees we want to talk about maintaining the trees that are already there keeping those over trees healthy but right now to go back to the guarding phone lines David loved one good morning\nRon How are you concerned yourself\nNot too bad and I um [noise]\nGet on making compost over the years and I basically just have three wouldn't dancer kind of opened on the front\nAnd the top uh but they do their job pretty good they're in a halfway sending location but my question remains a is one uh one of the ban is kind of done can tell it it's it's fully ready to go I don't always need to use it I got the other to advance caught up cooking\nAnd medicine to bend it's already completed hiking this seems like a keeps shrinking shrinking shrinking my question is should I put that in ... that you're back to keep it so I don't know if that ... the weather and the rain and everything just keeps melted into this sort of it's already underneath it\nWell it does that under still could decomposing okay\nSo it continues to break down so it never stops so it's always raining down so like if you had that pile there eventually it goes all the way down until there's nothing left and it's the decomposing pretty much worked its way into the soil\nOkay so I could get that into into some kind of bag or bucket\nWell but even in the bag or bucket it's still going to decompose so you you know yes you know that the way we should keep it in the bucket\nBut it's still it's still gonna shrink down a little bit I think the thing to remember is you know that's what we're that if you look out you know an old free falls down and you have to stop playing there the tree trunk laying there eventually as a decompose is it all goes away and you don't see it anymore it's down in the soil and that and that's what you're saying if you have raised planter beds and you do a\nSixty Seventy percent topsoil and in forty thirty percent organic matter\nAs that breakdowns in the top soil as vans always shrink in volume and you always have to come back and keep doing them up because that's the organic matter is it breaks down so so yeah if you want to put them in something uh you know like a buckets her bags or something like that would would be fine absolutely\nLike a back after this break down and didn't really like motor or anything like that\nWell it could if it doesn't can't breathe well you know he put it in the ... and you can't breathe as well as a matter of fact sometimes you look at Baghdad compost they'll punch of couples in there just to allow it to breathe a little bit otherwise I Am old and actually get a little bit nasty and there are sometimes\nYeah you're right that 'cause I ... going into the soil that's already laying on her house was his job\nAnd like you said is it in there yeah is it rains and the wind blows the course obviously that's kind of leach in and out of there too\nMhm well good yeah great what can you do store years in anything or is that you just use it up\nAnd try to try to use it up as you need it and of course as you get in the fall season you know top dressing soil amendments you know adding to the garden or whatever you know this is a great time per soil amendments and all that and that's where composting really comes in handy this you know you're you're ready to go compost this time of the year\n[noise] well I don't really have like a garden but I Do have some I couldn't get a couple a annual bad things go crazy and there but I guess I could uh aren't going around on my brushes him that kinda stuff\nIt as a top dressing use it as a mulch a you know and if your if your neighbors aren't using compost and you've seen that a little bit of extra a list of gold and most people would would you know pay to get that kind of compost\nYeah and and now you're now you're losing as\nOne last question I I came here and get a coffee and a um\nYou really can't put too much coffee and obviously I'm not I'm not ... percent coffee or anything but a cause that they've got a good amendment\nOh ... ... you know what coffee grounds ah can really fire up a compost pile I think you know coffee grounds can be added anywhere but put them in a compost and they compost pile that stuff is so great to help fire that compost pile up it's it's crazy so yeah use them and their Kenya over use it\nI Would say there is a point we probably could have a little bit too much but I don't I Would take a lot to get to that point\nGuard here say they're from great show and all our cat you're saying\nAnd I did good talking to you a merry go by and we're going to Virginia and talk with and good morning\nHow long it will for us possible yellow jacket issues\nI think [noise] ... killer life um [noise]\nIt's like for the arch roof area of the second floor balcony for heat up front door mhm taken the arch and its circular thought to ensure that\nWe've never seen anything go in and out if we didn't see if the cells\nAnd not for why strike a cold shape\nWell they can be but there are the ones that do that that smaller round shape as well now you don't see anything come in and out of it at this stage\nWe add\nUm you know just to ... you know the thing of it is once you start getting into cold weather you get a good frost or whatever that starts to knock all of 'em out and eventually of course that thing is going to decompose over the winter time of my time to get the spring for the most part let's just really heavily protected will break down and fall apart\nAnd the winner would I Would I be able to knock down\nAs soon as you get into you know thirty degree temperatures for a week or so you got it made the the other thing you look at is you know if you can if you can hit it with that foam morning was
