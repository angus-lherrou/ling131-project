to just to be clear or are spontaneous and people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations\nA fleet paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWell it keeps you face that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science hasn't told us that so many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the\nMiddle of the night and they're non mall over or their vibrating\nOr they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call in or signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call an out of body experience\nNow it's important to become aware of this\nThat we do this naturally anyway I mean do you now sees when you are when people are going to the travels the experiences you mapped the brain or do you make any type of um recording of their travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there was a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there's one in each a we have two centers and uh there's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states\nHave consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery or twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror yeah and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise and in fact I speak it one night it on this class\nAnd I talk about how to initiate obese but they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how to remote view more effectively for instance\nThere's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught and if you\nWere interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy\nWhat is a mind mirror twenty people hooked up to remind me\nOf a mind mirror is just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device I'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each Martin mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple

you most responding to [noise]\nBut that that that's one of the beauties of the Monroe Institute is that there is research done in these areas\nBut for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the experience themselves\nAnd not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound a spiritual experience ideally throughout a body

but ... he and I planted it next to it but it still little so it must be a male or female or one or the other anyway I'm I'm I'm watching closely so that I can harvest is by Barry fourteen and as a spice\nKate unfortunately those are male and female plants and they're not so male and female so when you combined those with the garden centers or whatever you can you know they're not by ... by their instructions so you can buy male and female\nYeah you'd actually have both right ... yeah they're both get those for the female is produced a fruit while you're twins to plant several of them\nYes apparently um I've got both now so I'm excited\nSo let's hope that works just\nKeep our fingers crossed anything else for us this morning\nA wealthy herb garden as I said the pineapple ...

B. U. dot com slash Westchester or spring borough\nThan all kinds of great information on there as well so we're still seeing ... in the area what's the deal\nWell that's you know it's typical they know when to leave okay they know when to leave leave when they're ready um so keep your feeders up there's you know plenty that are coming from the north and still heading south\nSo leave those theatres that we have for at least two weeks after you see a humming bird but um I Know you like to leave them up to four for bees and then the great ideas and the reason why not yeah\nThis is a ... and what she's talking about is that what summer's are all through\nYou know if we don't have anything and flour and it stays warm late into the season bees around looking for something to forge on as well and you know they'll take advantage to stick to the guards off and let the obese advantage to take advantage of that the sugar water as well and they ... they will thank you for so\nDeep down birds up and leave feeders at least two weeks after you see the last one you're not making them stick around into one what happened to\nYou know you noticed one still hanging around your chances are could be something wrong with it I mean really\nYeah there couldn't be um and and you don't want to you know remove Its Food source for sure\nYeah so you just to keep it up there and the eventually they will all make it a down south ... to where they need to go to these hurricanes affect them I mean the kind of housing though you know hang on be don't fly across the Gulf until their gains are all done\nWell they gather you know they they all gather not all of them large groups of them and gather at the at the golf and you know there I mean yes they have some sensory ability to you know feel what's in the air in terms of when current and that kind of thing\nUm but it is you know they decide when they when they want to go again they usually fill up at the golf um\nBefore they had over so yeah\nI Love it they fill up in the Gulf mhm so we just are getting loaded up with all kinds of food for the for the big trip to new sound the horn and everybody takes off that's it follow each other across the Gulf Monica ... with us this morning from wild birds unlimited\nSo we're going to keep the feeders out for the humming birds are of course now that we're starting to wind down this season lots of berries and things like that and she's out there for the birds right now kind of a good feeding time for the birds or do I go off on the birdfeeders or keep going\nNow right now yes you're right there is a lot of natural food sources out there right now but the fact is is their ... their their winter areas their territory so\nUm you know having your food available as a secondary source you know is key to I'm helping them and also seeing them all winter long\nSo yes we'll keep it going do stuff to keep ... feet out there but they'll they'll go for the natural stuff say well you know I'm not making them lazy birds\nNow you know and even I mean you know tell your listeners is in like reasons not to clean your garden [laughter] right um the birds do eat a lot of insects throughout the winter ... hibernating insects so\nLeaving your plants I mean you know there's some native bees butterflies ladybugs you know they they hibernate some of them hibernate in the hall a stem the like the bomb\nUm swallow tails you know over winter in ...\nI'm hanging from dead then I'm leaf litter that kind of thing so um you know you want to leave your your garden a little messy throughout the winter it gives you know the birds are a good jump start on this spring that's for sure\nSo not only does Monica brew bakers home have thousands of bird feeders all around their house and birds everywhere but it's a messy garden fall winter season\nIt is honestly it really is I leave everything out there and just that you know in the spring I'm Benno clean it up then everything's depleted\nA clean up in the spring for Monica Brubeck or wants to birds uh we get to the wintertime and you know what it really does make sense yeah I mean it really does and we talk about cleaning up in the fall and I do a really push the you know cleaning and the fall get you off to clean starting the spring\nAnd as long as you promised to clean it up in the spring [laughter] you know seriously and you get older and you know the the disease material all the way and all that to her a gives out a way but you're right it's a you know it's a great uh for the for the for the birds to be able to forge through there and\nUse it for cover and all that kind of stuff so you know what it is kind of go to leave some of that up there so especially when you're dead heading cone flowers things leave it alone in this day has once those you just kind of\nRight and even even um you know hostile um jump hosts are are are um\nDark I jumped coast come in from the north this is where they spend their winter is okay and so a lot of people calm snow birds they're generally dark dark brown black on the top and then they have a white valley um they love the the seeds from the house to plant\nIt from the half the flowers so you know even leaving those that it's a great resource\n... interesting so you know ... obviously start to move out of our areas the temperature start to cool them down so do the do the guilty or do they stick around all winter\nNow they generally that they generally migrate yeah I've seen still a couple as a matter of fact I saw one yesterday but yeah they do migrate most\nMost of our our native backyard birds okay backyard birds do stay here but there are um migration sitcom local migrations where they'll move to find food so like Robin have you seen any Robin you know I haven't seen Robin and mow among all\nAlong right and some winters we do but it's all about their natural food source so they're probably heading you know they may not be here but they may be farther south or they may be up north in areas where they can find their native you know resources there but um yeah like that's what birds\nAnd was overdone and go in a lady had three or four Bert stations I mean ... ... I had so much fun sitting there watching the\nWoodpeckers go after the blue jays worked or whatever and who visited one new took one and he went back and forth it was I mean I was mesmerized when I sat there for Fifteen minutes and watched these critters do their thing and the rate entertainment\nIt is and and we're lucky enough here at Ohio to have such a fabulous variety of birds you know and birds to stick around all winter we've got very colorful birds you know we've got the the cardinals of course the blue jays bluebirds\nGold finch even though you know the males just you know have recently gone through their molting so they're not that bright yellow but they're still the olive drab they looked like a female color but they're still here mhm so you know it's important they liked the theft so\nUm yeah you can feed you know there's lots of different varieties birds all have preferences for for what they'd like to eat and setting up multiple stations facing your your birdfeeder\nAllows bird you know many options like you said the blue jays you know when they fly and yes all the other birds at the feet are are going to leave and that's because sized dominates correct\nSo but those birds can go over to another feeder in your yard at the same time and and feed so having those multiple stations is key\nThey're very very important course of your house having thousands of bird feeders all the way around the house and the ... being basically fly through birdfeeder I'm not an issue there [laughter]\nNow exactly and the other thing is having him at different levels you know now is the time when you want to put out your ground feet or if you don't if you don't typically is a ground feeder now's the time to do it because\nLike I said the junk oh they're coming in on the white crown white throated sparrows we've got a ... we've got a lot of ground eating birds that come here just for the winter\nSo you don't typically see them up on a feeder so you put it on the ground and there's a couple of things you can put in your ground feeder because you know squirrels of course would be able to get into the theater\nUm ideas of what I like to do is use their so first of all and I know that sounds strange but\nPutting thistle and my ground feet or I have covered ground theater um that has a mash bottom with flags and um I put this all in it because our chunk of love it and sort of the sparrows but squirrels don't eat it and so then you don't have to worry about that\nAnd then of course the all important FARC butter bark butter that I'm the hot pepper variety so that's a high fat high protein sue it\nThat you can put in theaters a simple form and as you know hot pepper mammals tasted so the squirrels raccoons\nThey taste it but the birds do not so a great resource they're\nTo me one of those bark butter bitch but then they let that they may be one bark butter bit\nRight yes the ... bird bath right and that and not be back\nAnd then they run the bird bath and then it's it's all over for their then there was a bark butter bits and that's one thing and when the Robin moved back in the springtime and you can throw those on the ground and ...\nAnd hey we're getting you know what we're getting I'm very excited 'cause it by the end of the month will have um bark butter in its native form is a spread to pursue it we're going to have the hot pepper variety of that when this row yes and you can spread it on your trees and again the squirrels won't won't be eating it\nShe'd get real creative when you get to bark butter spread and spread it in the bark of the trees and the birds coming feet off the bark of the tree\nHundred and forty five different varieties of different species of birds have been seen eating eating the bark butter so yeah it's a great food and we're very excited that it's going to be in the hot pepper form\nShe and you would not have known that had you not been listening to Monica Rubik or this morning from wild birds unlimited again the ... the website\nW.

settles sprays\nAs a preventative\nOr rather than a curative so as you as you spread your protecting the new growth that was coming out\nSo you get back into check again so you can do that but the kicker is some years does it and some years it doesn't\nUh just depends on the weather and the rarely does anything to the tree or the shrub besides make it look bad right otherwise are using a pull
