{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Arthur Ford himself shortly after I think it was about [noise]\nA couple of years after the say on\nHe was in a really bad car accident he was with his ... eyes car accident\nAnd his healing processes hated by pain killers and some of this is a morphine and he becomes addicted to more than a need for the rest of his life has morphine and alcohol problems and I think this might have affected his ability to function as a psychic\nAnd much later near the end of his life and I'm Sorry\nI don't have the dates on this he was involved in a very high profile said\nOn 'em with pike that's the name that comes\nTo my oh James Pike up yes it was up here on on I'm In Canada upon earn a Canadian Man so there's another Canadian connection yeah\nYeah yeah and I think it's an I'm looking at it now Nineteen sixty seven forty how a say on for pike now pike son\nHad tragically committed suicide the year before now what Ford did for this high profile say on what he did with all the secret do the trick is the only thing that\nYou kind of breaking up a sign on his Thomas ah I'm not sure if it's a cordless phone or a cell phone but maybe if you keep very still speak may okay\nI'm area it's actually a voiceover I. P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay um the James Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide a year earlier and now Ford is doing a say on on Canadian TV\nYes and and he does a little upfront research brings it into the ... as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from a conventional way this was discovered after four died and people went through his papers\nAnd found his research preparing for the ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first to break through convince all the hard nose skeptics who just isn't\nBut but okay so Ford is discredited\nIt because of the stance in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking or perhaps that had damaged his medium ... abilities does that necessarily discredit the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it that it does or doesn't I I just that it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching\nAnd you know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor Cody then why did she continue to do the same ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight but when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do it on the top ... will be higher closer to God and the spirit\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail\nSo she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and and that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go\nBack with my friends and embrace the standard mainstream belief\nBut you're inclined to believe that the original statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur for its been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do and the other letter that she wrote to wind chill is also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and so I'm not someone would say well if she was tricked and didn't know she was tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have in front of you if you could share with is the final words of Harry Houdini as brought forth by Fletcher and Ford Flex your being spared guidance for it at the end of that successful session can you share those words as we head into the break\nHere um and this is the words of Harry so it's um [noise]\nTell the whole world that Harry Houdini still live and he will prove it a thousand times and more in my life I was perfectly honest and sincere in trying to prove the survival of consciousness\nAnd I resorted to trick to prove my point for the simple reason that I did not believe communication was possible I Am

heard that Gary sports\nHas Harry Houdini as a spirit that he's been working with over there at the University of Arizona about\nFashion that's fantastic well we'll have to get a Dr Schwartz on the

glories and red sunsets still out there still strong performers\nCome across bread with silver maples no silver maples up you're familiar with him I Would is I've always said I Would never recommend the silver maple anybody although a as a kid I planted a couple of my parents' yard in one of them is still there today with about a\nThree and a half what Trump diameter which is in huge and it's every year as to be cleaned out in Deadwood in it and all of that um but it has grown over all these years and still pretty good sized tree but you know it's it's a it's been a messy tree through all these years but anyway [noise]\nNever recommend a silver maple but obviously the red maples a with a ... medium growing tree good branching structure obviously the red maples were developed for the red fall colors the ice your roof room which is a red maple\nIsn't really called red maple because of the fall colors called red maple because of the red flowers in the springtime\nBut then they found red maples that had read fall color the been began developing the cult to bars that you see out there today I went from there but\nThe folks a plant breeders out there took the the best qualities of the red maples\nAnd crossed it with the silver maple to get a tree a hybrid maple that gives you all the great benefits of the red maple that we just talked about good branch the structure harder would um the the fall colors the size and shape\nCross it with a silver maple which gives us the ability to take on about any type of soil um they'll grow just about anywhere and there are a faster growing tree\nSo it took this medium growing tree to make it a medium to faster growing tree that tolerates a lot of different soil conditions a lot of different sites\nWith ... with a with great red and orange and yellow fall colors depending on the selection you pick\nAnd they've turned out to be a an excellent group of um coal to bars hybrids are called the bars that have just done an excellent job and they're called the Freeman I series\nA seer Freeman I and then the name of the tree and about a two thousand and six or so we first introduced a autumn blase\nBlase was a two thousand I think six or two thousand eight urban tree of the year the municipality of ... and then as a useful ... I'm Sorry the society municipal are wrist I Believe it is anyway they chose their tree of the year they do every year or urban tree of the year and that was their tree of the year\nAnd it really brought up a lot of attention to these new hybrids that were coming along autumn blaze being one of the first\nAnd continues to be probably the most popular that's being sold out there today absolutely wonderful tree but then there are other varieties that came along all they have a little bit more you know there's a distinct something about each one of them I'm a little different than the other\nAnd so today what I've done is on our plans of the week on run was lonely dot com a feature both on and blaze and CNN Glenn\nWhich I Believe was the second one that was introduced after autumn blaze um any CCN ugly and but then there I've listed about six or seven other Freeman's selections that you will find that your local nurseries and garden centers\nThese hybrids are not something that is hard to track down I'm becoming very very common place in the nursery isn't in the garden centers so if you're looking for that\nUm medium to large are growing shade tree forty five fifty feet plus some more upright than others more rounded ... heads and again you have to learn about each one they have their own little thing about them take a look at these Freeman I selections\nAnd again I've listed a I think about five or six on there for you to take a look at a couple of pictures on there for your bottom blaze in Sienna Glenn\nBut I think they're actually choices for you as far as that larger growing with a little bit of speed to give you something in a reasonable amount of time\nShade tree or in the yard garden or can be used as a street tree it can be um if it's in an era I don't like playing any thinking that narrow area between the sidewalk and this and the side and the street\nUnless it's about eight feet wide less than that it's just not a good thing you're always going to be I don't care what tree put in there it always has a potential of lifting up the sidewalk overtime or filling up the area because it's such a small area it's I don't care what you put in there even ornamental trees although takes them longer they could still have those issues as well\nBut again great tree overall tree for again lawns shade tree a street tree again it's called a sheer Freeman ah hey\nThat's the theory of the ... the hybrid seed name and then you get all the cult of ours that go with it so check it out to run Wilson online dot com quickly

us have that existing landscape been around for ten Fifteen Twenty years maybe even longer and you're looking out there and you see me and I'd really like to change it around a little bit change it up renovate a little bit\nBut you just not sure where to start and you watch some of those TV shows or the or the why shows do it yourself shows the Iowa I'm Sorry and you know they just go in there to tear everything out and start all over\nAgain will you know not everybody can do that as a matter of fact in many cases you don't need to do that you can actually work with what you have\nWell I found a book that can help walk you through the process of garden renovation you can evaluate what you had to say what you want and put your plan and the action and transform your yard into the garden of your dreams the name of the book is garden renovations written by my good friend Bobby Schwartz and she's with us this morning the morning or\nGood morning Ron good to have you on a show with us finally lovely to be with you\nWell you're such a popular person out there always speaking to everybody and tell them how to do this\n[laughter] we're ... we had to wait in line to finally get you on your shirt gray first of all great book very well done\nThank you I'm good at it did call on everything I've learned in\nOver forty years of gardening and landscape design\nForty years oh yeah you started when you were fine but of course wow [laughter] so you started as a kid\nI actually did not no one in my family was a gardener yeah uh but when we bought our very first house it came with a garden and my next door neighbor came over introduced himself and proceeded to name\nEvery plant and tell me how to take care of it and then I started reading and try and ling plants I got hooked\nAbsolutely obsessed with plants and now you could say that I\nTurned into a plant and done I've been having so much fun with plants ever since and eventually I had friends and neighbors ask for advice\nAnd I realized I really did more than they did so I started a business uh by picking a name buying a vendors license\nSo that I could buy a wholesale cell retail\nAnd we're talking forty years ago I was charging ten dollars an hour for my consulting surfaces wow [laughter]\nAnd then I started taking courses and landscape design and joining professional associations that I was always attending seminars and workshops and networking with other people in the industry and the rest is history\nThan the rest is history and of course then you are smart enough to take pictures of things that you've done over the years\nI was I always photographed and there are two hundred and Seventy five photos in the book and two hundred and sixty of them are mine\nWell that's that's phenomenal Bobby Schwartz is with us this morning the name of her book is garden renovation your website is ... dot com correct that's correct\nBy so you need a website as well and check it out to be jeep some a dot com the book is garden renovation\n'em and you know this this really does make a lot of sense because what you like you were describing what you see you and when you get called out to do is probably you know the clean slate the the clean pilot doesn't happen that much you know you never does but you know it's it's the folks that have\nInherited an existing landscaper had an old landscape and whenever I Do with it to make it\nTo free up or make it a little bit better and you do watch those shows you only going to just rip everything and start all over again well not everybody has that kind of a budget and in many cases which is what you do to help and that's what this book helps as well there are so many things you can continue to use and incorporate into changing in a room\nYeah there's generally speaking there is no need to rip everything out and as you say it's very expensive to do that so I generally do not work on new homes because there's nothing there to start with\nA instead I work with owners of the existing properties and I I have found two things now you mentioned evaluating the landscape and then figuring out what you want\nI Would have reverse that water I Would say sit down\nAnd write down what your goals are mhm um watch\nDon't you don't like about what you have what do you wish you had that you don't have is there any way that you want to change the style is it to form or do you want to make it less formal do you have something that\nIsn't working for you for instance a patio that might be too small for your family or for entertaining\nAnd once you set your goals\nTakes you won't be able to do everything at once\nSet your priorities and then figure out your budget because there's no sense designing\nThe Taj Mahal if all you can afford a log cabin\nSo then you're ready to take pen and paper and walk outside and look at your property as though almost as though you had never seen it before and say I like that I don't like that\nThat's too big it's covering the the plant it's covering the window or or it's hiding the door\nOr you could ask yourself is the walk to the front door wide enough for two people to walk side by side is it safe\nUm is it just a straight shot\nEither from the driveway or from the public sidewalk that\nYou to get basically from point a to point B or\nDoes it ... or curve and there's something lovely to look at along the way so that you are actually on a journey [noise] um I talked about the patio\n... if you have an existing patio again look at the material does it fit with the house is it big enough is it safe\nPeople want something beautiful to look at properties that are comfortable to be in but they don't actually want to\nGarden mhm um\nAnd at the plant to haul like I obviously love plants but there are so many plants that are available many of which are not used um which I think it's really a shame because every\nGarden every landscape should be different they shouldn't be cookie cutter and they should reflect the personality the place\nWhere the property is located\nAnd the needs of the client everyone should be different and I hate driving around seeing front yards that all look the same and there are a lot of them the other thing people need to know is what can be saved\nBecause sometimes the plants have grown so big usually because people either are afraid to prone or don't know how to present and\nThere are many plants I'm\nEvergreens had particular that can be proven brought down to size sometimes they're just too big and you do have to rip them out and I hate to do that but sometimes it's inevitable\nSure and so again that's what this book really helps walk you through um things to look at how to evaluate income coming up with the budget when somebody says they want you know the low maintenance thing that's become like the those the two famous words are what are you looking for a low maintenance right um do I mean seriously do kind of charcoal a little bit\n[noise] I Do a little bit but I also understand that when I started designing generally speaking I'm\nA property was owned by a husband and wife\nRight there we have changes mhm with partners\nNow um and it used to be that one person in the couple worked and the other one's stayed home so\nHad time to guard and now most of the time both partners are working and that's one of the reasons people are asking for lower maintenance\nAnd I make it very clear that there's no such thing as snow maintenance you can lower maintenance by your choice of plants\nAnd one of the important aspects of that is buying something that is smaller than you want it ultimately to be because nursery and garden centers do not sell plants that are at their ultimate growth looked at the time\nSo you have to have patience\nUm because if you buy something that is as big as you want it to be now it means it's going to get even bigger right and you are creating maintenance problems for the future\nSure Bobby Schwartz is with us this morning her book is called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams are website as Bee Gees some dot com how\nAbout we got a couple of minutes to go here a lot of requests for working um you know growing our own foods now becoming very popular in China in corporate corporate that into our patios and and landscapes as well do you see that being on your project list as well\nI Do um the biggest deterrent to doing that at least in in the Cleveland area\nUm and so I'm having to design garden set our fence and then there is the problem of whether to create raised bed because edibles need really good soil\nAnd sometimes the best way to do it is it gives the raised bed or a container than you are really in charge of the soil otherwise you have to do a lot of men\nBecause ... um and fruits do not grow well in heavy clay non training soil\nThe book again is called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden

and asked even when we even when we're looking at walnut trees\nYou know those roots will go out past the drip area of the tree so you when you're calculating where to put the garden you ... you know you calculate even further pair the drip line but they can do that depending on the soil type but you're right it's all within the top twelve Fifteen Eighteen Inches max\nAnd when people if you realize that you realize the effects of drought sure hot temperatures how that affects those plants because they really aren't as deeply rooted as we thought they were\nAnd I was I was told by came
