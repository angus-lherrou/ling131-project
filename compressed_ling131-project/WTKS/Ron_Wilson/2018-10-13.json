the observer Ben what inspired you\nFrom day one or maybe I'm you know you're Twenty one let's call it\nA always loved the stuff but yeah as far as ah the book I think that a lot of ways that came about from just picking up these things over the years I think I could look back um to college when you have a beer bottle of beer that sounded twist off but you don't have it opener\nUm but somebody always had a big later on and I got taught a kind of the party trick of being able to to wedge a bottle of beer open with a lighter um\nAnd then you know kind of accumulated some others along the way and then you know like it was silly enough to talk to an editor um themselves was silly enough to say we should make this\nA book [laughter] the uh the big lighter that's if I follow along correctly in the book that is a matter of using it as a wedge basically right against a tightly gripped finger around the bottleneck\nExactly after grip correctly or it's all laid out there um with illustration diagrams a and everything you need to figure it out but yeah you're actually using a the lighter as a as a lever a lever and your finger as a fulcrum\nUm so it's all highly scientific as you can do\nEnd up for those in desperation mode even holding up a piece of paper super super tightly can function the same way\nI think yeah that's a great one that one's actually um something of a bar but to where you tell people buy but chicken open this year with a piece of paper that way and\nAh and then you fold it six or seven times until you have a thin very stiff hunk of paper um any of the same principles and then somebody owes you a beer\nOr sequence been Robbins and he's got a new book called ... tips tricks and projects he's also editor in chief of the observer what about some of these projects which put together on that\nOh man so these are really fun um a lot of them and all of\nWrapping a empty beer bottle with a piece of string that you've ... and after the tone and lighting it on fire [noise]\nUm so that was you know one of one of the more enjoyable testing phases of creating this book um but it'll basically sever its way through the beer and you can turn it into a glass to drink a glass to then\nPut beer and um I'd recommend you know standing heavily the edge to\nProtect your mouth I'm can create tiki torches or that you can put outside to ward off ... which unfortunately um scientists haven't figured out exactly why I don't know that they've been spending all their time on this uh mosquitoes love people who've been drinking beer so you gotta\nGotta fight 'em off um [noise] yeah there's a a number of other you can make shot glasses I'm with the basically the the bottle next um that you've severed off\nFrom the bottle and yeah I think there's like some it's some fun stuff to do and I think all these things are better than getting five cents at the recycling center\nAnd he's been been Robinson again the book is called beer hacks one hundred tips tricks and projects\nLike the last one string soaked in asked the tone wrapped around the bottle then lit on fire decreed beer glasses shot glasses or even tiki torches it six minutes now in front of

I say we frozen and that was good and it was just really simple projects I mean we didn't you know just wash 'em and uh we put them in a gallon court a gallon plastic bag and froze\nInteresting now if folks aren't able to get out and some reason they do they bypass and they were only able to plant garlic in the fall it's still can be planted in the springtime if you jump on an early enough yes\nYou could do that they're probably the ball sizes and going to be as as big\nA and the advantage the fall planning is like um if you're planning now first of October to maybe even into November it depends uh just just you know so it's not the soil isn't too muddy and that's the main thing\nBut uh with that to draw as you said it really makes it easy to harvest because we could actually with the straw keeping the soil moisture in the ball size stays pretty consistent and then we could just hand poll devolved\nWell that have happened trying to dig 'em\nRight you know what was the straw and like it like he said the weeds were small we could you know a few episodes coming up for something like that but we just go through and and handful\nSure now any fertilizer you amend the soils at all or jail\nWhile we did we use we had a we had access to common or you know wait a minute or the fields but yeah you can for you can use in any type of a fertilizer organic if you if that's what a ... pretty much used phrase anything like that", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "13"}
