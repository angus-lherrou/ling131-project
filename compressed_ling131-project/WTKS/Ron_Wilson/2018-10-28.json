weeks that the state fair is open so I I I Would never have got their shops that are just open for one month in in ...\nYeah but but other than realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year but now they're starting to open longer so if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museum so ... so\nThey're starting to realize that they can do this year round us down roads and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what ... what are the rules a lake or curbs that they they are either written or unwritten about how people are ... you know behavior or to or how they want to risk just to be in in Salem\nYeah and they're they're getting better and better at that as figuring out especially like to be around that time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the barrel route to the old seventeenth century um

like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on them and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts\nBut that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar in federal party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over ... start heading to the train and start having their cars\nSo there that's really good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe that the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to get for

toll free number eight hundred a two three eight to five five talking about you already got an an article posted on our website this week and we posted last year as well and it's a great article somewhere that are always talking about mowing the leaves back into the turf\nHow important that is and and and a great way to use up a lot of the leaves in your own yard and I say use them up because there's other ways to use them without ever ever putting them in a bag and putting them out on the curb\nAnd moan them back into the turf has one great way to do it sometimes that can be a little scary what folks because you're ... back in\nThe key is I'm finally ground leaves that's the key if you're more doesn't really grind them up or you can't go back a couple of times if necessary or you don't have a mulching more that really ... fine that's what you need and you can only do this with matured lawns you can't do with new lawns first year lawn don't do this\nBut ah two years law all on our older no problem but again you know you put those ... back into the turf very very important but again somebody came and said you know well what about the wildlife and leave and leaves on the ground because there's a lot of wildlife and enjoy\nThe leaves and their eggs exactly right as a matter of fact this already but what we had found about what to do with fall and leaves\nAnd I love the article\nBecause it says lead to lease for wildlife and it goes on talking about\nA different species of wildlife like salamanders in box turtles and toads intrusion earthworms not insects that really enjoy the leaf layer to live in butterfly and ma species over winters ... leaf litter\nI'm you know the all of that and of course the leaf litter breaking down and I agree a hundred percent I think it's outstanding and doing their exactly right but my point is and this whole article\nAt the very very end says something about um if you live in a condo or homeowners association where you can't leave him land than you may need a break them up or ... back into the ... into the grass was fine or\nYou know find or ... you never want to leave leaves laying on your lawn if you want a lawn next praying you leave leave laying on your lawn is mothers out the lawn over the winter and you've got these barrier is come spring so take those leaves and put them in the ... areas\nUnderneath the trees most beds places like that in the garden and let the wildlife enjoy them in those areas\nBut on the turf you need to grind those up and put them back into the turf but the turkeys to be alone open and available for the sunlight and to be able to breathe in the whole nine yards over the winter time got to be done so don't leave leaves laying on the turf\nWhich you can leave and land in other places for the wall I like I said I totally agree with the article ... other than the fact that you just don't want I mean you could leave them on your lawn if you want but I guarantee you you're not going to much of a lawn come next spring\nAnd that's my point so use them and again great way to using compost them trench composting pocket compost bins tumblers\nUm you know there's lots of ways to use up the leaves in your yard and just naturally putting them out on the ground in ... in bed areas and around the base of your trees as the mulch that's what they're all about that is my Mother Nature drops them in the fall the nutrients back into the soil or to multiple roots are for the winter time that's what it's all about\nUm so I agree with that but for the turf I said get the leaves off or ... actually mode and back again and again if you're nervous about ... leaves\nMoammar early in the in the a leaf drop time in the ... giant time maybe you collect those up or moment then collect 'em up and use them elsewhere and then as it starts to slow down ... back into the turf again I also heard someone say this past week that lead frosted a couple of times in our area this week was probably his last\n... for the turf wrong you keep mowing the lawn keeps growing\nAnd it's going to slow down big time because temperatures are slow down but you've got to keep mowing as you normally would and I'm only be a couple more times\nBut you've got to do that until it stops growing you can't tell you don't need to mow anymore and then you're done but in the meantime if you've got leaves falling you're gonna keep mowing every week to keep the leaves under control\nAs they're falling in your yard she got to keep that up as well\nSo don't you're not done yet mowing trust me in our area you still have a ways to go and you know further south definitely a little further way to go and up north you probably are starting to really slow down but still a ways to go so stick with it please and again if you haven't done that last that they're not last and federal on yet you still have time to do that\nWe're going to be looked at that last meeting in November but you still have time to feed it\nSo don't don't blow that off okay back to the guardian phone lines we shall go an eight hundred a two three eight to five five run in Cincinnati mourning\nMourning Yes sir [noise] skinny I Am a huge tree\nIn my yard takes two of us to get our arms around it and uh it\nHas this year as dropped that kept separate branches yes every three or four days I have to get my writing or out and collect them and they cover the ground and I know I've always lost them every or sometimes I think the squirrels\nCut cut him off the ache orange but is there anything going on with Korea said would drop this past month he would not believe the pile of stuff I've collected from\nYou or you know I and and I I always refer to my my mom's yard she has ... and they've got the same way she got a couple of ... that are\nFour feet in diameter the trunks and there are a hundred and ten feet tall it about a hundred and ten feet why would the branches out but every time you get a really strong winds storm you always get branches of fall down and then some of them are pretty good size sometimes about every\nOh I don't know about every three years we have a certified harbors go through and actually clean them out but the trees are in great health it's just the way they are as they get older like that they will drop some of that you know you just get a piece here and there that that will die out so we haven't cleaned out about every three years or so\nBut this year I have noticed the squirrels just is not destroying the trimming those folks like I have never seen them do before\nAnd she's got a ton of squirrels and they're just nipping the ins and those branches off like crazy and you look out there after you know your demo and and there's you know six inch pieces are so laying everywhere in the lawn\nUm I think I backed up a little bit I used to say um Thanksgiving and at the end it really does depend on the weather if it would warm up and and then launch continues to grow and stay green and your mowing right up to Thanksgiving or we can wait that long to put down that final ... because typically it was we always looked at when the lawn finally stopped growing that's when we went in for that last\nA loan application\nBut sometimes you wait that long sometimes it's a the weather changes and and it gets really cold you wonder how much are you know benefit of was putting it down so I started looking at you know a couple of weeks in the November\nLooking at China long range forecast see what the weather's looking like where's the lawn at that point in any time like the second week or so you're good to go but I Would you know again don't hesitate and if you don't have that bag of fertilizer or bags that it takes to to feed your lawn the second time\nOr if you haven't found it at all you can still do this and that since second third week of November go get it this weekend\nGo buy it this weekend so you've got it in the garage or in the garden shed so you've got it available so you can get out whenever the you know the couple more weeks get a good day get out and put that down very very important so many times we just kinda\nYeah I'll Wait and see you know wait and see in the next thing you know I'm In the holidays and I don't go to the garden center and I don't get the fertilizer and some places have put a lot of it away and so you know you just kind of skip it\nGo get your fertilizer this we can be ready to go for that final feeding when the time is right having the garage or in the garden shed waiting for you to go okay don't don't hesitate this is very very important I Can't stress enough um how important it is to feed that lawn\nTwice in the fall very very important but if you haven't done it earlier I'm saying you could still do it in November that's better than nothing at All right and we'll look at the doing whatever in the spring by the way other question came up about I'm\nBroadly weed killers in the grass we talked about you know October being a great months to do that so the question came up Ken I still spot treat weeds in my lawn absolutely\nLook at the at the weed killers at work and cooler temperatures fertile loans weed free zone\nBon ... we beat her alter our two that work at forty five degrees so those are two broadly if we killers that are great to use on those early weeds in the springtime and the late weeds in the fall because they work at forty five degrees now if you've had it two or three good frost on talking good frost\nOn your broadly weeds in the lawn\nIt actually kind of slows down the process of the week killer action\nIt's nice to get it on their before we ever for us but we have had a couple of good for us and if that's the case you may see it not it take a little bit longer for it to work and you may not see it at all you say whatever they can kind of green going into the November it trust me it's working but it won't work as fast if it's been frosted but you still have time to do that\nSo if you want to spot treat get out their coverage you have to work in between rainfall or whatever but if the weather is right get out there and you still have time to do some spot treating if you don't get to it will look at it next spring and we'll see what we have to do at that point to union Kentucky we go build good morning\n\nUh Charles I'm Sorry Charles good morning got a question for you sure I got to have a one I heard\nYou get caught I caught the end of it about the next thing\nBuddy soul and farfetched\n\nUh that that Gary and I talked about\nThat's been six months ago and I hadn't been able to get through the oh uh I I don't really hear that yeah I Know I'm not supposed to do that\nThat was first though I was proceeding he yeah he used it as a top dressing in a barrier area in his lawn\nAnd it's you know it work the grass came up right away but the problem is it's such a light mix it all rooted in the top of that he couldn't keep it moist enough he wound up taking that out and then scratching the the party ... into the regular soil and ... is ceding it again but the point was don't use use that regular potty soil\nAs that Phil or on top because it's so often it does you know it's not like a regular topsoil and he used a kind of like a filler and a point where did you can't do that now to mix it in with the soil or to mix them with the soil and a flower bed outstanding rare fact I'll take a few parts that I don't know what I'm going to do with next year I'll dumped that in in a bed\nAnd just rake it in really well I like using that for that and it's a good organic matter that back to it\nBut that was a bill area in the in the lawn where he was actually see\nOkay well I just caught the end of it yeah that's what I was going to do was I had a ... ... ... and then there and I thought maybe I shouldn't\nYeah it I mean and then with the bed no problem mixing it in with the regular soil no problem but to use it as a filler problem\nOkay I got ... ... it's okay uh the roots come up with the graph yes uh I got\nTwo trees after I don't know which one it is I've got a large ... like you were talking about ... and I also have a\nTwo foot diameter a\nWater maple mhm and there are about thirty feet apart the water vapor ... dies I shut down the or don't want to lose a ghetto right\nSo you but you can't tell you can't tell which the surface roots are coming from\nNo I Would I'd put my money on the maple but\nYeah more than likely it is and and typically you know it's not the best thing in the world to remove those surface routes to cut one or two off is okay and I think the maple would tolerate it with no problems that are they're pretty good about that uh would tolerate that without much of an issue\nEven the piano good old mature when you had one route was caused with an issue I'm sure you could pull that off and it would probably not affect the the big oil because well but I'm with you the the maples one thing the oak as another\nYeah I've got to\nDo that are actually three feet long and two inches diameter that are all\nIn a lawful [noise] yep yep yeah I you know and again if you think if you think it's the ... I mean three feet longer so and it's so far away from the tree [noise]\nWell it it's close to the oath treat but I've seen maple trees I had a problem with the I was down if I was ... and I was down checking at a drain\nAnd like the guy as I said you got rich and the drain we started up the steps that I heard on the explosion [noise] I mean it was like a cannon going I'll\nFlip back down in the basement [noise]\nAnd uh really uh like an elbow but we just bought [noise] really aren't\nInterested I got I got to take a break but I I'm I'm guessing that's probably from the maple um if you're not sure I'm a certified ours come out they can take a look at it but if it is I wouldn't have any problem taking nothing out of the eight hundred and eighty three to five five you're in the garden was run was [noise]\nGardening questions wrong has he answered that one eight hundred to three calls and your in the dark with Ron Wilson\nImage will Ninety am you know when you [noise]\n[noise]\nAt a place of worship I'm Pam who sounds Fox News I synagogue in Pittsburgh the latest target of a person with a gun\n[laughter]\nUsually a few folks chatting on that page during our show 'em as well that's our Facebook page in the garden with Ron Wilson eight hundred a two three to five five back to the gardening phone lines we shall go alliance Ohio Linda good morning\nOut that morning ma'am I\nCaught it is a little bit ago I turn my radio on present when I say have you ever been there all the all the time can show yes\nMa'am oh the pumpkin pie you ever saw\nThat do do people actually eat that thing\nI don't know if we had\nSo much fun it was just you know of course it you know the fall time getting fees and everything it's just really really fun to go\nBut anyways um I just got a little bit it got talking to a gal who just had I had her her yard we see it and she's still at straw down yeah I heard when I turned my radio on you were talking about it she should pick up something that strong and I had the same situation I have a city lot\nThat I um my precious brother in law to have such a nice guy he where he said it and um [noise] well I had an air raid it and to um [noise] uh unfortunately I don't know much about taking care of my lawn and I've always had done that\nPeople retire that I was having to do my lawn\nTrying to get that well his diet is such a small yard\nI'll go ahead and put fertilizer down myself ... unfortunately I didn't know that you don't put fertilizer down after shifting receded\nActually you can start or for life now and\nI did I used to hold back that's the problem at NPR oh did I burn out oh yeah you can't do that uh\nMy my my wonderful brother in law and you know he he put he put line Scott salon soil down any put the on top and any more soil and then he puts more seat where like Jonathan Green I haven't done anything really good feet around long\nTime as a matter of fact I can make a long story short I he put the straw down I have quite a strong set my question is should I it's growing um [noise] I don't know if I should know about the bat at two or three inch blade now\nHere's here's what you want to look at once it gets about three and a half inches you do on a mode and knock it back to about two and a half inches and if you can do that a couple of times yet this fall would be good for the grass\nSo yeah I have I notice underneath his dry air spot yeah ... ... I think I'm an idiot I'm sure\nNo but you're going to that's happens because sometimes you don't get a good even take you know German nation and show you wind up having some areas I'm\nIn one way yeah which handling it\nExcept to fix it for me next spring I back\nAnd those were the grass is really starting to fill in nicely\nGo in there when we were talking with her was that go in with a rake and just lightly rake it to see if we can get some of the straw out of there just some of it okay to allow that grass to kind of continue to fill in if the grass starts to pull up as your raking stop you don't have to happen\nBut but I Do try to pull some of that out of there just to open it up a little bit um and let it continue to grow once it gets about\nThree uh three and a half inches high I Would mode at about two and a half inches\nNow ... when you do that you're now will pick up some of that strong blow it around a little bit\nSo every time you know you're going to take a little bit of it up but uh if you can do that a couple of times is going to be great going into the winter now once you do all this and it's all said and done you're going to have some center areas some areas where the seed may not have come up with what I Would do is about mid to late February\n... have your grassy go get some grassy now same grass seed that he used to have the same mix and do some over seeding in those areas where it's dinner or where it didn't come up with all\nThe oil and then put the you\nKnow in this case we're just going to put it right on top of the ground I mean it handed to late February and the freezing and thawing of the ground work that see right into the ground for you\nCan only get into springtime that seat will be sitting there waiting to come up as the weather warms up and then start to fill in those bear worst in areas that you were left with at the end of the fall\nRight so you're saying I should rake it now I'm just slightly lightly rake in the areas where the grass is really coming up Mason for aha okay and then once you\nGet about three to three and a half inches high mhm\nMode and about two and a half to three inches\nSet my lower up higher\nAnd measure it so it's a two and after three inches and the give it a ... when when you do that you're going to pick up some of the straw it's going to happen that way that's okay that's what it's all laid back\nIn my bag or on my hour\nYup gives you could pick some up that way and then that doesn't blow everywhere\nRight yeah I Am worried about that than what I've been watering at you know every day well and float down the street you know ...\nEven more sure that's what you're looking for don't keep a wet suit even moisture and then yeah and then you start to collect a little bit of that up there'll be a little bit of it'll stay on the ground over the winter time but the ... will really pick a lot of it up for you but yeah Baghdad so you don't blow it everywhere I well\nI think I'm Glad I called I was so worried about it ain't like you just can't call my brother in law today they live quite a ways from me and I yeah I I'm Glad that I heard ... thank you Ron I think we\nAppreciate thing to do now is to make sure you've got that bag of grass seed ready\nSo get that soon so that you can do that in mid to late February\nOkay okay yeah I think green go absolutely that's why I say

for a number eight hundred a two three eight to five five talking about you are eating right back to the gardening phone lines we shall go Jose Sherry grove good morning\nHey my question but I'm the most stressful ... we that's coming toward my yard ... yeah and you know what I'm doing my so whenever I see a little pocket here I pull it out by hand right ... believe it or not for Trump said\nWell that's good you're on the fact that\nI think the thing about member well of course it starts to show up right now as a matter of fact I always bring all these notes to talk about during the show a lot of times you'll get to all of them but one is if you're noticing brown patch is starting to appear in your lawn a lot of times folks things grub damage when a lot of times it's nimble we'll we're going dormant and all of a sudden you know you you didn't notice the during the growing season\nAnd that started to go dormant you see these brown patches everywhere it's like oh my gosh and ... and again you know we think about trying to spraying or whatever to kill it but it's a lot of folks will think about\nThe seeds that it drops bad yeah which is really bad yeah\nI'm yeah I'm Glad because I had a little small patches and not get yanked him out by hand yet you know what I used to kill it with a around a black man they're not have to go through the great you know\nYeah well you you know and you're still the round up you know still at one of the answers but you have to wait till the greens up\nWide right in the spring doing in August and yeah and and sometimes I'll just tell folks cut it up like a side and roll it up and take it away and then you take all that out the rise of ... and the seeds\n[laughter] but yeah it takes a little bit of work is no doubt right\nYou know one thing that it happened to me though is I planted a free for it\nAnd a half for it a little a ball Cyprus and I never thought that there was\nThat day that time a day oh yeah yeah\nWell in ... and it only I only planted a great way to go now what do you suggest should I spray it with a black\nNo don't do anything if it's got loose bark that's hanging there\nTaking taking the utility knife and only going as deep as the bark get rid of any loose bark that's hanging thanks to the to the to the deer alright yeah cut that off but otherwise you let the tree seal itself back over ... paying no nothing now obviously I'm guessing you probably already put a barrier Rahm is with the deck and get back to it again\nYes but I don't really know I my index finger like yeah\nI Know you think about why would you want that little thing but\nThey do and so you you you clean that the loose bark off otherwise you let it go and let US Steel itself back over if the scratches are less than fifty percent around the trunk of the tree it may totally recover and you're good to go if it's any more than that uh it's a wait and see what happens in the spring\nYeah no it's ... percent but either way it's kind of trashed it though\nFor a good point there is the fact that we don't want to use those tree paints let us see lower by itself\nI'm Glad I called the can down there [noise]\nThank you so much for your time I do say good talking to you you take care and Mike in Cincinnati good morning\nJust like Yes sir Hi how are you a good and yourself I'm good I'm good good\nA I'm a we've got a ... on a you know and a couple of days ago the wind kind of blew the tree over got hung up in a tree but it's no doubt on the ground [noise]\nThings like three and a half feet around and I was wondering like we've looked at it for Twenty years and thought you know maybe we'll get that down on the ground one day and you know makes the tables\nOut of it or something to that effect but we're not quite sure who to call what to do or you know how to how to go about doing that\nSo it is blown over to the state's gonna have to be cut up and taking care of\nYeah it's on the ground alright hum that we've left uh about two feet are on each end of the the girl so we can you know over it\nRight um you know there are ... you know and again you've got certified Arbor so you can work with and you've got tree services that you can work with and you get to fly by night or ...\nAnd you've always got to be cautious I always say you know get make sure that whoever you work with you know pays workman's comp you know that they're certified all nine yards checkout to make sure they get the insurance before they even get on your property\nUm and you know you you hear Ron Ron with us she was a certified master certified our bases on her show all the time a run actually some contracts that stuff out but he actually can take care of that is called the Arbor doctor\nHe can come and take a look at it and find someone obviously that's certified it could take care of it uh Madison treated as a great job\nAcme tree on the west side of town does a great job a there are many handles three service out there do a great job so there are many that you know that are certified ensured a but that's the key\nWhen it comes to ... you know who you're going to work with is making sure that they got you covered ah when they come out there to take care of what you want to do so you're going to try to cut it up and actually turn it into a tables\nThat correctly yeah here that the trees no problem that's all done she shopped okay yeah so now you're looking for\nYeah I I'm ... you know again they may have references for you to go for the next step um again try the ... tribe Madison tree I'm sure they've been involved with that track the tree and handles\nAnd see if they've got where is the next step to take that thing to get a you know to a um wood shop for somebody that can take care because I'm sure they've dealt with that before\nOh okay All right\nGood luck with it good luck with it and that's a tough one but I tell you you're a losing those trees but it's nice that they're able\nTo use that especially who's got the big brother on there to use that as a as a table that's ah that's cool great thing but again check with your ah certainly your local harbors\nBecause I'm sure they've dealt with that with the other people's well getting into the right the hands of the woodwork her to get that taken care of for you also want to remind you the tree trunk protectors we were talking earlier with Jose if you plan of trees is fall you have smaller trees\nGet the tree trunk protectors around them wiring around them chicken wire\nA hardware clause something around the outside of those physical barrier to keep those bucks here from rubbing on they're very very important you lose your investment they'll take this like he said thing has been no big on your index finger they don't care\nThey'll rub on those and then you've lost everything so keep that in mind if you brought your foliage plants inside keep that bottle of insecticide all subs available", "show_name": "Ron
