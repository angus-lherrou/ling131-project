talk with Michael by our NBC Radio news Michael ... dance continues\nHuh everybody's investigate in right now\nAll of this I Believe a magnum PI has been called an already is on hold waiting to come in and I think James Bond is ready to investigate as well so it it there is going to be backup plans here if they aren't getting what they're looking for out of this whole thing but yeah\nAs you pointed out the circus continue to deep in a little bit we saw at the very end of friday sort of the theatrics involved in all of this where Jeff Flake and he pointed this out yesterday on sixty minutes said\nThat if he was not walking away from the Senate if he was up for reelection he wouldn't be able to do what he did on friday which was in essence they installed the whole process of the voting and say I think we should have an FBI investigation so that investigation is underway President Trump promised to give the FBI free rein in this probe\nBut the New York times on Saturday reported that the White House it asked the FBI to question only four witnesses us\nLimiting at least the probe on some level so then you had a because we can't have enough drama here and then you had Dianne Feinstein go hold on a second that we want to copy a the the judiciary wants a copy\nOf the written directive that the White House sent to the FBI\nThat hasn't happened as of yet and that's just the stark here too are weak and well we're going to say we do know that one of the accusers has been a talk to buy the the FBI we do the Denver marriage has been interviewed on some level we also know that Julie sweat Nick at least the third woman to come out against\nKavanaugh has not been contacted by the FBI but neither has Kavanaugh and neither has Dr Ford so to see where this investigation goes over the next couple of days will be interesting\nThey should've started with the investigation as soon as they got the letter like July\nShould have been you know you're exactly right this should have been a long process that would have given us enough information I don't know when it comes time for a vote on some level even have a over the course of this weekend\nA four FBI cheap James Comey saying that the he thinks the FBI will be able to get a bunch of information despite the limitations despite the partisan attacks but he did say if the only goal here was truth\nThere'd be no time clock there'd be no week\nFor this investigation he also said that he believes that this is political on both sides that the Republican goal is to be able to say there was an investigation that didn't change their view and the Democrats are hoping for incriminating evidence or on some level highlight of a complete live from judge Kavanaugh to derail the nominee on some level\nMichael by our NBC Radio news in Washington Michael ... the Republicans are calling for an extended and the FBI investigation from the standpoint of looking into Dianne Feinstein\nA handling of all this that this could have been secretive as a doctor forward allegedly wanted by going to Chuck Grassley immediately when she got the letter this could have all been done in secret the investigation could have been taken care of this from a woman who didn't know she had a a Chinese spy owners now for six years\n[laughter] it's kinda tough to take anybody real serious when that in the clear allegation get you're getting at listening here at the end of the day ... when does that investigation how much help set can you truly be if your ... your part in this whole thing\nSenator Feinstein you kept this thing quiet whether it was the best of the woman who was telling you that and you were trying to get her to come for whatever the case may be you've kept the quietest why all of a sudden now is the time right for you to ask for this big delay in the process couldn't you've gotten this taken care of earlier couldn't you brought to the attention to people earlier couldn't you've gotten\nA lot more information that would have made a better case for your side of the other side or whatever side but without doing that withholding all of this information you certainly aren't going to get a full scope and then to say that you're demanding that time now\nDoesn't necessarily seem right on so I think you're right I think there's going to be this investigation it's going to go on I don't know what they're going to find but I think that they should definitely they definitely have the right to get that invest investigated clearly and with one hundred percent accuracy\nAnd best of getting the attorneys for a doctor for days or a who paid for them 'cause she said she didn't know\nAnd number two they were supposed to ah ... they were supposed to tell their client or give their client information the current ignore her she didn't know that they had offered that the Republicans had offered to fly out to see her in California and in and talk to her privately\nYeah she was clear about that as well and I think that that information will indeed come out I guess I guess it depends on whether or not FBI will be going to speak to her and getting more information along those lines I did also seemed to say as far as the who was involved in paying or we don't know other than she said that there were supporters in her hometown or where she was living with that community there\nThat had the ability to pay for that we don't I don't know the details of that I don't know who that is but yet\nAll of that should be able to come forward here as well\nUh in Michael you mentioned earlier Jeff Flake of lives over go with the proper surname it's him a ... and you also mentioned James Bond secret agent double o seven well yeah Jeff Flake out they could be ... double oh what's your mattress IQ [laughter] I don't I don't\nBelieve that he should be on this it anybody who is not who was movers resigned from the Senate should be on this committee\n... I Would I Would have to say who who who decided that that was a valid move I mean that's going to be and maybe you don't know until what happens on friday happened but it would certainly bring up the question going\nForward right it certainly begs the question on if you've got somebody who decides that they're not going to run again there'll be walking away from their seat do you keep them in that position do you keep them in such a prominent position on such a prominent part of the Senate do you do that or do you walk away from that because this in this particular case that obviously shook this all up and ... and for\nStatements yesterday he says definitively if he were running again this would not be something he would be able to do if he wore in need up for reelection again he would not be able to make that decision\nThat he did on friday so it all has everything to do with the fact that he felt I guess a certain level of freedom and lack of political pressure from doing this that's why he made the move\nVery Michael you got a lot of work to do [laughter] so we asked him and we're going to be looking forward to hearing from you again before this was all over if it ever is\n[laughter] I'm pretty sure of all the guys I visited it [laughter] funny\nYeah and of course the Supreme Court starts it's I'm next to this new session this week with only a justice on the bench there should be nine and it should be Brett Kavanaugh thinking Michael Bell or NBC Radio news in Washington coming up next of South Carolina flooding latest oh geez oh there's a\nVery important thing that any of the evacuation she'd be doing so if you're here and you've evacuated or you know somebody who evacuated\n...
