University of Tennessee but we keep allowing the dogs the beat us so I guess you know that's okay [noise]\nColonel though an important event and I are that are wonderful organization that is saving may be some sort of killing them\nYet and that's the key thing we have to understand if there was something that is morally right it is to stand up for our most vulnerable which are unborn baby and I'll take on this day when we had the president signed an executive order you know declaring that life begins at conception that's a huge step especially for a\nPerson that did not hold that belief not too long ago and indeed\nWhat is it about the left that seems to be so hell bent on I mean that's the first thing they were asking when the cabinet Harry's got underway and that seems like every Supreme Court justice as as the same thing are going to say Robie way and what is it like about killing babies\nWell I don't know what they like about killing babies but I think the most important thing is that they believe that\nAll of our inalienable rights do not come from are created comes from them\nAnd therefore they're the ones that should be able to determine who was born and when you die because when you think about the Affordable CARE Act and you have this thing called a a a independent payment advisory board they're the ones that are making the decisions about you know who gets to medical care\nAnd you look at what has just recently happened over in England with the national healthcare service where you had to a baby's trolley garden Alfie Evans or that the government denied the terrorists the ability to try to find a healthcare solution\nAnd those two babies die to baby boy so this is why we don't want to allow the left to continue to believe that they're the ones who determine that and they all of a ride the very first one which is life\nAnd we've got to the election coming down the pike hair ... how do you look at well\nLet me tell you something you guys cannot elect Stacey Abrams to be governor of the great state of Georgia because when you think about what George has stood for the the proposal\nPrinciples and values and my parents raised me on here as a young man growing up in Georgia she does not stand for those things and and it's so important that we don't look at the identity politics and don't get caught up in the image but think about\nYou know truly what does this stage than for about the history of this state house stood for the revolutionary war all the way up to the present day and the men and women such as myself that is produced to go out and fight to defend our way of life\nWe need to make sure that we honor that first most important thing and others life and then our liberty and pursuit of happiness that people that believe they can guarantee happens\nIn the Saudi led nationally how do you look at me telling us it's so close but they told us that in twenty six\nYeah ... you know you don't believe these folks cause I think a lot of times they're going to tell you whatever they think keeps you from going out and vote you've got to be inspired now when you look a couple of weekends ago and you saw people climbing on the the statues of the Supreme Court banging on the doors that's not what we want to have an America\nWhen you have Hillary Clinton is talking about\nA there was no civility with people that don't agree with us they will only be civility when we're in control when we were in power that's not civility that's tyranny and and you know here in Georgia we raise fighting men and women and and we don't take we take all British with that\nAnd so I think it's time for us to get our gander up do I know what's gonna happen no one knows what's gonna happen but I really believe that American people have a clear cut choice\nAnd we'll start teaching history you know again as well the interview suit and monuments being torn down and and and the way we hear about the they don't they they can't they don't know we got three branches of government that we're spending a boatload of money on education\nYes we're spending a boatload of money on a system of adoption nation that education has really changed when you look at you know the left does not believe in governing they don't believe in the three branches of government the\nLegislative executive and judiciary they believe in the three branches of rule which is the media academia and the courts and that's why they got so upset about the what's happened to Supreme Court because they need to\nCourt to be able to implement their agenda\nAnd so when you look at Robie way you look at over failed versus hired at the same sex marriage case you know Congress\nAlthough as opposed to make laws not Supreme Court [noise]\nAnd that's why I think that they are really concerned about the fact that they don't have activists judges that are going to be sitting on the Supreme Court\nThat has to be while they were so upset over things like having a ... that ... that was that was a\nIt was down it was a meltdown and and that's what the American people have to look at it do they want to live on the tyranny do they want to accept this portion\nInsemination violence the threats or they see coming from the other side because they have nothing to offer as far as policies that really do promote our way of life and economic growth and prosperity and

nation\nBut it's a second here in the beach they were kind of thinking about maybe Macon Georgia just the coast guard state here at the end of the day because we got such a great relationship but at a special layer and I'd like to offer just a hearty welcome to a\nCongressman buddy Carter is just we enjoy a great level of support from the congressman's\nYes boy isn't that the truth as admiral Carl Schultz who was the commandant of the coast guard coming down here to as we were been designated channel ... he's been designated a coast guard community and I'm In L. Scott give them a key to the county or Carol Bellamy sending in for or any ... mayor the mayor pro tem\nGave him a key to the city or one of the ladies from uh from time to be a given ... so ugly connected treasure yes so what we've got we we ... the man has got the keys\nBut admiral salts gave a really great wow each on the history of the postcard\nWhat here great presentation he had yesterday on a thumbnail sketch of a history of our coast guard\nTo this day has been a long time long time coming Chatham county founded back in the late Seventeen hundred and Seventy Seventy seven I Believe long and distinguished nautical maritime history and for obvious reasons or when it's your maritime history for more than two centuries is that of the United states coast guard\nAnd ah the relationship here harkens back to the very origins of our service the many for various of what we call the modern coast guard here twenty Eighteen or that joined or Twenty years ago Seventeen Ninety our founding father secretary of the treasury at the time Alexander Hamilton recommended to then President George Washington [noise]\nFirst president that's way back then it organizations be founded that became known as the revenue marine service and that organization ... and with the support of Congress\nAuthorize ten vessels to be built\nThose ten vessels were going to help elect terrorists in revenues to pay for the war dead of the nation\nAnd here on the waterfront those vessels were commissioned August for Seventeen Ninety One of the first time\nThe revenue marine service screener eagle\nStarted her origins here that's how far back the ties with the city\nUh since that day and there's been a cutter\nFirst revenue marine cutter\nA coast guard cutter and the modernized coast versus Nineteen fifty as maintain a home here in this gray regions of the country\nOr collective history goes back further\nYou know before the first quarter of a White House services tablet shoulder ship the type yellow and white\nAnd I'm I suspect most you know the story of Florence Marta ... she was a sister of a lighthouse keeper George Martin she worked at the mouth of the savannah river for forty four years from Eighteen Ninety Eighteen eighty seventh a Nineteen thirty one orange greeted and waved every arriving shift\nNow are like tiny waving girl sculpture stands on savannah is historic waterfront just one of the many symbols of this great communities ties to the maritime an Eighteen fifty two in response to Georgia is booming maritime academy\nThe savannah steamboat inspection officers that wished to spec falls in boilers or shifts falling on the port\nAu Prince will be the caught and trained at the time\nToday this community sports one of the largest and fastest growing poor complex as in the nation or I talked to the congressmen I think it ranks number four number two on the east coast contributes to three hundred and fifty thousand jobs in the region over eighty four billion\nDollars revenues contribute to the gross domestic product of this nation you know the coast guard just rolled out what we call maritime\nStrategic outlook that looks at the next ten years and the key roles coaster plays and enabling the economic prosperity the nation through these things called our waterways are sea ports and this is a critically vital area and we're just excited for the partnership here\nWell man he was great what a magnificent presentation yes that's one of the best I have ever heard and so admiral Carl ... the commandant of the United states coast guard does it\nUh American and Israeli a guy who was who was captured in bed and I know it was a terrorist organization it wasn't a country necessarily associated with it but they did the president said was upset over this over this and then then there's cause Yogi character\nWell the only thing that I can attest to that bill as it possibly what we're looking at is a different day in time and social media as we've seen over the past couple of years if you just look at the last two years alone and and and Trump's presidency\nUm how social media has just taken off like a rocket and how news is spread nowadays I mean it's it's there's hardly a time that a headline break it used to be that you had to actually wait for tomorrow's paper to come out you could see a headline and really read the story and now it's moments after that headline is launching New York times and other newspapers\nPut stories out in the middle of the afternoon would never have made it into any newspaper for anybody read\nFor at least the following twelve hours so the fact that this is happening in this day and age and that the ... the news is getting to us quicker we're not waiting for delivery boy to come and drop it off on our front porch and then paying him a tip at the end of the month this is something that gets right to our phones with the media see in some cases even notices on our bones\nThat we get before we even know what our charges on our phone so I think that's the element of that this playing into this as well\nAnd that indeed hurry to Michael stay on it will be back in touch I have a great weekend\nHave found this week and what your weekend guys need to have to kill and I yes I I I I'm I'm like oh\nDid you hear about the guy that was on the three of us on the

hard to see those kind of a legend or maybe down or whatever and they're rescuing people off the roof of houses or elsewhere\nIt is on believable what they do God love you guys thanks for calling on
