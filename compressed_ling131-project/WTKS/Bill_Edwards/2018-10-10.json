weekend and see if that changes anywhere\nYou want to come down here that's been real real nice for the weekend\nHere either then even if I get even if it gets dredging rain down there there'll be enough when the kind of blow dried off me so that'll be a\nGood thing that'll work perfectly yeah what uh what what are you here right now Michael\nLet's see uh the storm is strengthening guys at the category for storm it's extremely dangerous as a mentioned by the national Hurricane Center it could blow shores the strongest storm to hit the U.S this year but it's going to be even stronger than that already we knew there was a hundred thirty five miles per hour sustained winds that kind of got into the category for element\nBut that is now growing this hurricane is not doing what most hurricanes do which is as it approaches land it starts to die down a little bit sometimes you see categories drop from a three to uh to not this guy\nMichael is continued moving forward now those winds up to a hundred forty five or a hundred and forty miles our sustain a we've got gusts going up to anywhere around a hundred and sixty miles per hour right now now\nThe eye of the storm expected to hit around two PM this afternoon just east of Panama City so it's strengthening its planning hitting Panama City or just use of Panama City around two o'clock is suffering the outer bans in case you haven't seen the size of this thing since last time I spoke to you\nThis storm has blown that it looks like it could if it were just just placing it out there it looks like it goes from New Orleans all the way down the west coast of Florida there so it's a massive the size of the thing has grown twenty to Florida counties over two million people under evacuation and as we've talked about that for that storm surges is the biggest problem that's the biggest life threatening concern\nAnd that number has written so we're looking at the possibility of nine to Thirteen foot storm surge as\nA witch at this point predicting St Mark's right around there could be right around the Big Bend Florida could get the most deadly storm surge at this point and if it makes\nA category for landfall it'll be the strongest hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history\nWell uh I can remember a hurricane Camille that hit the ... Gulf Coast or when I was a student at Ole Miss and went down to about several months later Michael and you could see just a just foundations were building the ship ships were still on the shore\nYeah I mean people are are we living you go back to Denison two thousand five which was a category three uh in that same kind of an area in a boat strewn in places where boats shouldn't be a grocery store is kind of devastated to a certain extent and listen when you get an upgrade from a category three to a category for\nYou're talking about not just a a brief step up you're talking five times the damage possibility between those steps so you're looking at some severe damage it's going to happen here and when\nThis thing cuts it's pat swap across the U.S\nGoes through you guys there in Georgia and South Carolina North Carolina out to the Atlantic\nUm you're talking about winds uh forty five miles per hour in rain soaked areas to begin with\nSo we're looking at the possibility of millions without power for what could be a pretty long period of time 'cause there's just not enough cruise to repair things in a timely fashion\nAnd that the truth and of course just tropical storms that we've had over the years a severe flooding to the west of us are making was severely flooded back in the mid eighties uh along with the the west part of Georgia because of the because of the movement of the storm just a tropical storm that came up in the midst things in this thing is is that on steroids\nYeah I mean you're looking legitimately by the time kids inland and start getting into Georgia in general you're looking at that still being\nAt what would be considered like a category one sort of hurricane with wins in the rain and everything there so in that at least the way it's planning right now\nYou're looking at this thing hitting mid afternoon here just east of Panama City then you're seeing Georgia getting getting hit by tonight the Carolinas by tomorrow night and then out to the Atlantic by friday night that's at least the path of which this is going right now\nUh this thing is a massive storm and right now as we speak is gaining strength not losing strength or on the

category for bringing an enormous storm surge to the Florida Panhandle and so we are really hoping that anybody who\nLives there or was there certainly he did the call to get out because now is probably getting to the point where it's too late\nAnd I think that's what's driving this guy had already point\nAlready you know yeah so uh it it it's um it it is a specifically harrowing situation I and uh it it is something that would be quite destructive and uh how quickly this became such a catastrophe\nShould really be a lesson for people who live in the southeast United States\nThat during this time of year yeah these storms happened and they don't necessarily give us a full week we often like you know like hurricanes for the reason that you know we'll see them form ... way out in the Atlantic and it takes forever for them to get here that this is one of those occasions where that didn't happen\nOr it happened very very quickly and uh it's another example or piece of evidence why during the summer months people who live in the southeast didn't have a certain state of readiness yeah this is not something that's just going to affect ah\nOthers and you've got to remember I I mean ... as governor of South Carolina she made about a hundred six thousand dollars a year which is a good paycheck but yeah they're really in today's world not not a not a ton of money\nThere you go

without the ... and Arkansas outside boxers radio John decker joined us live from the White House a morning John what's the scoop married a man\nA about justice Kevin all it was the first day on the court on the bench or any or oral arguments a yesterday his first day on the bench or he was welcomed by his colleagues a chief justice John Roberts with Kevin all along and happy career and what he called our common calling\nAnd then in court Kevin I'll ask questions of both sides\nIn arguments over increase prison sentences for repeat offenders he actually jumped in with his first question after most of the other justices had already spoken a and the questions from capital and also and other relatively new justice on the U.S Supreme Court Neil Gorsuch\nSuggested that they could actually vote against the Trump Administration and side with a criminal defendant from Florida who's fighting an increase in his sentence from just over six years to possibly more than Fifteen Years uh know disruptions in the courtroom\nUh and the justices laughed at each other's jokes there was a good mood yesterday when justice Kevin all had his first day on the bench\nWe're talking with John decker Fox News at the White House on justice Kevin O's first day on the bench and a ... where were you there did you hear hear any of the questioning or John\nOh I was he was such a busy day yesterday here in the White House and I was so glad that I was here a president\nOr departed yesterday for a campaign event in Iowa a and a before the party he took two of my questions so that was a good thing also we learn the news yesterday that Nikki Haley is going to be a leaving her post as the U.S ambassador to the United nations effective the end of the year\nSo a lot of news coming out of the White House yesterday uh but I was not there\nWere Brett Kavanaugh's first day I'll tell you who was there ... on his wife has two daughters were there to watch\n'em a they're a husband and father a take on the the new duties of an associate justice on the U.S Supreme Court his seat mate so he's now in the far right uh that's where the newest member of the Supreme Court sits next to him is\nA lady Kagan and why is that significant because they know each other in fact the late ... needs to be\nA she was a court appointed by president uh Brock Obama she used to be the dean of Harvard law school and she actually hired\nA Brett Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard law school so they know one another I think that there'll be a good seat mates together serving on the U.S Supreme Court\nWell you know even as much as a as Ruth a Darth Vader Ginsburg and and Antonin Scalia but ... disagreed on on legal matters and things of that nature and wrote opposite opinions or they were good friends\nOr they were you know it's it's it's only nine people on the court mom and a member of the court are obviously very select you\nIn our country they do get along and I think that the example that you brought out build a perfect example of that uh you're talking about perhaps the most liberal member of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd also a at one point you know obviously has passed away the most conservative member on the court while he served Antonin Scalia they were great friends they uh had dinner together they I think they've actually vacation together\nSo yeah just because you may not see eye to eye on particular issues that came up before the Supreme Court or doesn't mean that you can't socialize with one another and\nScalia and repeat again through or certainly proved that\nWell I Wish a judge Kavanaugh well I thought it was really classy that the president took his two daughters aside the other night and told them what a wonderful guy who would hurt their dad was and what a wonderful judge who's going to be\nA well you know I think that a wreck Kavanaugh in particular is someone who spoke you know the other evening a gave some great remarks in the East Room here at the White House has there for that ceremony had a great seat and it was quite an event I was very impressed", "show_name": "Bill Edwards", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "10"}
