concept of of launching inland landing and then we're using the rockets certainly saves a a ... any of space ... clients a lot of money because it reduces the cost of sending something to space when you can read recover these rockets and reuse them sometimes the U.S government and therefore\nUs taxpayers are the client but they have other a private industry clients as well\nAs so yes it does lower the cost of space a travel alert or transit anyway I and a by having different locations or you know being able to do do this from different locations um it it does make things more easier for for clients they don't have to move their uh their desire to a\nSpace found the item whatever it is a a either all the way to Florida or to Texas or do you know now that they have stuff that they are building on the on the west coast they only have to move it to the\nAh launching landing zone in in California it's much more versatile a for a business say a profit motivated business to be able to do this and more than one location it does bring the cost down for its clients\nAnd we're talking with him and brown Fox News in Miami over space actually attempting its first California rocket landing and I'm having this be used so they could do it anywhere uh so uh that also leaves for the versatility of of this program in as\nWell yeah well it's proving that it you know if they can do it from a facility in Florida do it from a facility in in California they can do it from a facility wherever they happen to build one and that's that's you know\nA certain obviously you know ideal

or uh even since you are right down there with the hurricane center we have another storm coming our way Michael will not our way but uh you you ... we'll be keeping an eye on a tropical storm Michael it could become a category one or two hurricane it\nWas a definitely a hurricane we think are very soon a Michael ... is a you know a strong powerful one not a large one of the way uh Florence has been but it could certainly pack a wall up\nA there's a lot of concern along the Florida Gulf Coast both the panhandle and the the west coast of Florida um because of the storm surge generated could a push the Florida is having this thing called red tide yeah which you may be aware of it's a it's an algae bloom\nMy and it's rather gross it's toxic\nI and it's really bad this year and it's it's actually now circling the entire state we're having it all the Atlantic coast we normally don't habit\nI anyhow this red tide could be pushed to the storm surge either a are around the state further or even inland er which creates a lot of health hazards\nOr not to mention wind when can certainly take out power this storm is probably going to make a mess out of places like Appalachia cola Panama City Tallahassee a but probably the most unfortunate thing about it it's going to make a nice ah north and then he ah east took\nTo the Carolinas keeping it set tropical cohesion which means poor

decker has been following things on the president's weekend at the White House and the Johnny good morning to you in a kind of kind of events all weekend was a nut\nWell it was an eventful week and I was here at the White House on Saturday for that historic vote happening in the U.S Senate as you mentioned bill fifty to forty eight and this is quite the legacy that President Trump will have to justices in less than his first two years in office he has\nNamed and gotten confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court both of them Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh a very young\nAnd will be on the court for decades and that's pretty remarkable for any president you know just to have to is just a ... in the president's looking perhaps to have some more are wearing the course of his presidency\nAnd John one wonders what they're doing what rabbits though the ... the left are going to pull out of their heads this time because this was hideous\nWell it was a very close vote 'em as we saw a ... in fact it was the closest a vote essentially in modern us history of fifty to forty eight\nOr almost along party lines of Republican\nUh ended up not voting voting present that Lisa Murkowski no Democrat voted along side the Republicans that's Joe Manchin of West Virginia He's running for reelection and I think that this pretty much field uh his reelection victory the fact that he voted more red Kavanaugh for the U.S Supreme Court\nFor sure uh John decker Fox News with the White House but other things were happening as the president was out on the road again\nThe president out doing another one of those campaign style rallies were getting closer and closer for weeks away less than four weeks away\nFrom the mid term elections he's going to be doing more of those over the course of the next few weeks as you know\nBill and law and uh you know a different this past week and that's what he's been doing every weekend or for the past few weekends is doing at least ONE Campaign rally a and the campaign rally that he did on Saturday was an opportunity for the president\nTo do sort of a victory lap after getting his choice for the U.S Supreme Court confirmed by the U.S Senate\nOr John John decker Fox News with the White House on the president's weekend in review and John you're up there on the swap a have ... that we did ... did you do have to go through many protesters this morning to to get to work or those people still there we don't have anything better to do\nNo I did not see any protesters are coming here to the White House um but I I heard from one of the secret service agents that I spoke to this morning coming into the White House there was a protest is ... I haven't seen the video or anything but there was a protest to sort of outside a majority leader Mitch McConnell's how did you hear about that I did not know\nYeah that's what he said over the weekend a and I'm a you know I don't know how long this continues but you know as we mentioned this last week or this was a big victory for President Trump than not permission vote\nOr read Kavanaugh but I think it will certainly energized Democrats leading into the ... I don't know if there'll be more ... uh energize the Republican you think so\nUh you know because now Republicans have achieved their victory maybe that hands down there to see as a little bit they got what they wanted a and so we'll wait it's four weeks away and Democrats feel that they have something to run on\nI don't think so John I I think this was absolutely outraged Republicans for the dirty tactics that were pulled by the left are just coming up with Louis charge after charges should these women coming out of out of the woodwork out of nowhere and making these ... species allegations\nAnd I think it's really got a I think is really got the the the base fired up\nWell it's certainly got the base fired up leading up to the confirmation vote you are right about that though I I just don't know if that\nIf that same level of enthusiasm tamp down a bit leading up to the midterm walk to wait and see you know it's really a guessing game at this point but we'll we'll ... we'll know certainly a less than a month away how the president did how the president will do a and how the president um you know he's\nHe's got really who incredible wins with both of these a nomination to the U.S Supreme Court in less than two years in office and of course that big legislative victory with the tax cuts so you certainly and the economy let's not forget about that\nCertainly got a lot to run on a and Republicans have a lot to tell a heading into the mid term elections have got a good message to deliver back home to their constituents\nThey do indeed John decker buses with the White House and you can see\nThat the the Kevin opening is not over for the Democrats are already talking about if they take over power they're going to work on impeaching him all that kind of ridiculous you know that well I Know it is but it's still they're they're trying to fire up their their base a and they're speaking of their base\nOf these people are putting up a petitions against Susan Collins from Maine when those brand new speeches I have ever heard of my life\nUh and and of all people I didn't expect her to come up with something like that and I was thoroughly impressed we've been showing all morning every civics teacher and miss social studies teacher in America ought to be showing this in their classroom as to how you bet a particular candidate for anything\nAh well look I I think that uh she is I think in a better position or one she run for reelection I Believe that's going to be in two years on this and colon there's no doubt about it uh her vote\nWas raised by just about every Republican lawmaker even former President George H W.

... is that a and Brett Kavanaugh was one of them on the list was that it gives the Democrats gives the liberals kind to dig up any dirt or to make up dirt as the case may be\nA on any of the nominees
