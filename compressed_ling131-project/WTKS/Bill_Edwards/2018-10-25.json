caravan a understand that it's breaking up Michael up there they've decided oh go back ... wait a minute [laughter] I'm Sorry I'm On the wrong page you know what you want to do the like fourteen thousand now they're talking about\nWell there at this point in time estimates are that some place that over the span of what we're looking at as a possibility of three different caravans that are coming in and maybe even a fourth one developing so right now you got this massive care of and that trucking through Mexico right still more than a thousand miles away from the border but there are other groups that are following in their footsteps sometimes literally so\nA while officials are keeping their eyes on this caravan forming in El Salvador there's another migrant caravan around two thousand people expected to reach Guatemala's Guatemala City on Wednesday and yet another caravan of migrants expected to leave Central America within the next week so if you add all of them up together you're looking at about ten thousand people\nTry to escape poverty in violence by making their way northward and that's a lot of people so now they're not saying that that ten thousand that will all come at one time like a like an episode of the walking dead that they just come up against the chain link fence on some level but there are you looking at\nYou know thousands of people that will be making their way over the span of time to the U.S border\nMhm Michael by our NBC Radio news in Philadelphia Philadelphia I've got you got your colleague on there and watching the swamp so Michael ... a ... this is not going to end it doesn't seem like this was going to end well\n[noise] well it it doesn't and then and we know President Trump is threatening you know putting in the military down there and we do know that I think he's been waiting to find out what these countries are going to do when Mexico going to do what's Guatemala going to do we do know that he's threatened\nA country's in regards to uh uh preventing the migrants from leaving El Salvador kind of standing right up and the president from El Salvador\nUh expressing support for the first caravan of migrants are kind of annoyed by President Trump announcing he would cut off aid to El Salvador and other Central American country so he's like ears the like go out and have fun\nI'm In Guatemala the government said it was adopting measures to to stop the entry of more migrants from Honduras and El Salvador to its territory but similar to Mexico any attempts made by Guatemala to to use military or police to stop this\nHad been unsuccessful in the same thing from Mexico in fact actually in Mexico a while they say they were going to step up security on some level they really stepped aside as the caravans of past watching the first migrants take wraps across the river that separates the country from Guatemala so there has been really nothing being done according to reports\nThat would be stopping these groups from coming through on any level now does that mean that they can get into Mexico and not decided to stay there that's a possibility but it sure seems as though\nEverybody's making their way to the to the free and mighty United States uh for the in the hopes of of not only escaping what they were leaving behind in their countries but the hope of what America has to offer\nMichael by our NBC Radio news in Washington over those immigrant caravan of Michael ... this was the thing is that all of a sudden fourteen thousand people decided to get

God they're saving the planet and what are the ... will run it all down forests are very shortly\n\nMeanwhile what else [laughter] what what else is happening as far as uh there there's some things that were also concerned about um as far as airlines go and things of that nature if you are or traveling this weekend looks like the weather's going to be pretty good around the country so not really sure if they're going to be any hubs delays fortunately most of the storms that\nThat we have been worried about over the last few weeks of 'em have dissipated there's that that one down through Mexico will or whatever it is\nThat is not the cause of many problems except warmed up a little more than we thought it was going to so we'll be talking with Jay here very shortly and also by the way we're ... if you just have a chance to get a grand in your hand we do that once every hour between six in the morning and nine in the evening just a Fox News at the top of the hour [noise] so just listen for your chance to win\nA thousand bucks meanwhile uh Jay Ratliff on the line there with us\nHey how you doing good morning doing great um I had\nSomebody asked me to ask you about this situation that happened on a flight overseas there was a black woman sitting on the aisle seat and the man with the window seat refused to sit there because she was black he called it was\nIt was a lie on air flight and uh the demand are seated in that window seat\nA had some very disturbing things to say as far as not wanting to sit next to hurt someone cut it on video it's a tough to watch\nBut basically was um attacking her verbally flight crew tried to intervene he attacked them verbally and amazingly this idiot was allowed to stay on the flight um they offered the lady a chance to move to another seat and she said absolutely\nNot [laughter] and I'm not I'm not because of this guy yeah and I think he was\nShe was really the hero the moment but um it\nIt was a perfect example for an airline on how not to handle a situation like this in a day and age where they will remove us for frowning at a flight attendant yeah to allow this kind of behavior on board a flight was unbelievably a blatant should never been allowed into Weiner's been apologizing ever since\nI'm not even sure but I'm not even sure I'm familiar with are the run but I think even told the guy that when we get up to about twenty five thousand feet or will open the door for you so you can step back I Want that yes\nOr no problem at all why and there's kind of the discounted version they're kind of the Southwest Airlines of Europe ... uh the the president of a riot and here's been famous in the past because he wants to eliminate seats he wants everybody be allowed to stay on because you put more people on board\nThey said they do that on trains so why not do it on an airplane you also for a while had pay toilets if you wanted to use the laboratory no uh yeah what Ryan airs a very interesting European carriers\nDon't watch that fertilizer Lulu All right so the rattler whether this morning on turbulence a so this American flight aborted in Philadelphia but goes it struck a deer\nYup but I was a tool and down the runway yesterday morning and uh it was an American airlines regional jet and somehow a or a box of mailed ear jumped onto the the airport the premises even though they have a perimeter fence sometimes of eight to ten feet tall\nGot on the runway and the collision incurred\nUh the aircraft to the crew aboard a take off they taxied back to the to the\nGate without any problem no passengers were rerouted on to other flights but yeah wild life is a challenge for any airport anywhere in the country it's birds we had at alligators deer moose different types of wildlife that have made it onto the runways and\nYou've got an airplane that rotation speed which is about a hundred and forty to a hundred and sixty miles an hour yeah the last thing you want to do is work to hit anything or something that that big\nWow how much how much damage are we talking about here J. was a\nWell I mean I I didn't see I haven't seen the report on that but it was the landing gear that was the impact that or to what degree I don't know and uh unfortunately my notes do not also reflect the condition of here\n[laughter] um I imagine it didn't ... not good yeah I think so so what would I don't know for sure\nJay Ratliff I heart aviation analyst so Jay there's another story about a flight between Chattanooga and O'Hare international airport that more than halfway through turned around because the plane was too big to land\nThe importance of it but but ... said ... agrees with us assessment that that Russia is in violation of\nA nation was also said that it would like to see the U.S and Russia talk before any final decisions are made and and and the nature sexy general spoke about this yesterday and he said you know they they all talking they they indicate that willing to talk and we're okay with that we welcomed this sort of\nAtmosphere of a a big opens holding conversations President Trump and Putin a Jew to meet a in a couple of weeks we'll say it in mid November\nIn Paris and so it's likely unless President Trump wants to make a really quick decision on that he's likely to this will still be up for debate when they meet maybe they can find some kind of way of\nOf updating it but as he stands at the moment the way the American seat is is that you have a treaty between the U.S and Russia\nThat America is sticking to Russia is violating and then there's a third party China that isn't even a party to it it can do what it what is I I I'm not surprised particularly to this is a desire to see this at least modernized if if they

and I was calling this these these bombs that are being sent to all these Democrats right now a stranger this was happening a couple of just a couple of weeks before the election\nAnd the Democrats who had been telling us that there was going to be as big blue wave a few months ago and now maybe it turns out that may be just a singing the blues\nSo all of a sudden they want to generate sympathy for these people and they want to blame Donald Trump of course 'cause it's all his fault him he was responsible for the sinking of the Titanic and kidnapping of Lindbergh baby and everything else nevertheless\nSo suspicious looking in the first place that you're going to put a neon sign on to bomb in here that they've got a they sort of if they lick the stamps than we've got the DNA from them and today's modern printers actually put codes inside the printed\nIn a message or whatever and inside the ink or whatever it's just so they could ... printer it came from\nYeah I I mean and these are and these experts are guys who can take up a fragment of unexploded bombs yeah and track it back\nNew made the bomb and where it came from now they have the entire package including the manila envelope with a bubble wrap interior and the computer printed address labels and uh everything contained in the device itself so they have an awful lot of evidence to work with here they can get fingerprints they can get DNA or they can get all kinds of evidence out of these things\nBills ever NBC Radio news in Philadelphia meanwhile bill a let's switch over to the foreign desk here what is it about Russian and Chinese spies listening in on President Trump's cell phone calls yeah\nThis was a report in the New York times that came out a that said that yes indeed that Chinese spies in Russian Spies listen to the president's phone calls now we have heard reports that the president or has resisted using security line and often just jumps on his own cell phone is on iPhone\nAnd and makes calls that way now if he does indeed do that he he has really denied it uh but if he does do that of course you have to believe that they're listening in on those conversations\nOr if they can I thought it was interesting that the the Chinese response to that a number one has said no this is fake news and number two they also said well you know if you're worried about security on an Apple iPhone perhaps you should use the Chinese a version of the iPhone because it's more secure\n[laughter] they allow the irony of that does not escapism [laughter] yeah [laughter] well what they might they might\nBe listening in on on us to build a yeah well\nThat's true you never know I'm not on my well I Do have my iPhone right here by\nWell we could say does but don't you I don't know what the Chinese version is the bill's ever NBC Radio news I Would think he wouldn't discuss any you know top secret information on that phone\nNo although you know there there were articles that came out earlier this year news reports earlier this year that some members of the administration\nUh most notably chief of staff John Kelly were concerned about the fact that the president may be using and um secured line in their cars so those reports have been out there but you would have to think that there would be nothing\nOf national security would be discussed now according to this article one thing they're saying that China\nIn particular is doing is they're they keep track of the people that the president talks too and if it is indeed a business relationship someone who he knows through the business community like Steve when no the casino mogul who also is involved in operations in Macau\nEye out in China that China will ban use their own business contacts that try to develop a relationship with that person so uh you know this goes this is a big conspiracy according to the\nTimes alright bill will leave you in charge here thank you much appreciate it you're wiser or it's or

it's a especially on sixteen anymore but that's about to change thank goodness yeah for sure uh is so why why why is that about the change Ron we've got that and I'm Glad you asked the question [laughter]\nI Know from the south has like wait for them you are you or something\nElse we've got a uh the the state uh interchange there's got to be changing dramatically over\nThe next couple of years he got to have um it's a very dangerous you have to change it sure is we're going to be adding a lane on each side are coming into savannah or which will be from a Ninety five coming east or that will lead to an enormous amount of traffic and of course we've got more truck traffic coming into the to the ports as well yeah\nA gym it alerts boulevard will be extending out so well essentially have a perimeter if you will that's a double extend all the way out to I sixteen\nUm and so you come from the ports now to be able to get these trucks off of the highway as many as we can with a direct route getting over to the interstate so lots of good stuff it's courses you know things were happening and Brian county and\nThen even then interchange enrichment how\nThat's going to be a game changer for these folks along with the widening unfortunately at the same time with a highway one forty four are these folks will have a a an exit emergency exit if you will out to the other end but the beautiful I've seen the the master plan\nYou've got a single landowner and the closest thing I can that's quite it too is the uh skit away island development which also had a a single landowner a union camp happy\nAnd I and it took decades to develop the thing is it's a beautiful development but this is really going to be a game changer for the for the county specifically Richmond Hill it's going to be a a good stuff\nWhere would that be on the interchange development\nOr the development will be a five thousand acres wow\nThat will start a on both sides of the uh interchange there one side will have a lot of industrial development with rail which of course helps gets the trucks off the road goes right into the Georgia port and on the I'm going south on the left side you're going to see this massive\nA slow development of um um residential homes which is you know it's really going to be the place to be but the beautiful thing of this whole development\nIs you're going to it's already master planned a and it'll be slow and even more they're going to ask us\nA next year to create a tax allocation district so that the folks that currently live in Richmond Hill won't be saddled for this massive development would come and it'll come on the back to those folks that are moving here\nAnd that's another Belfast counter exit can you get at chick fillet there to\nUh [laughter] I think\nThat you can probably get just about anything they're pretty a ... in the ... after about two years September of twenty twenty\nThat's fantastic Ron Steven's with us this morning to have a question for ... for seven twelve Ninety with the election coming up and how are you looking at Ron we've had we've had to your buddy and colleague Jesse patriot and here are talking about the amendments in eh we're taking the people on the members of the vote yes on the first foreign may know maybe no on the fifth one\nBut he also was telling us about the dangers of it is nice nice lady she is\nStacey Abrams as the governor is probably not the best idea we ever had\nWell she she's a little bit liberal to say [laughter]\nYou know I'm not the cell to them [laughter]\nOf the best quotes in the world is you know worked with a for a bit and she's tad liberal um but ... you know back on the amendments again the um ... do I want to talk just a second about Maher sees a law and you might as well be called a over the years\nThe Randall kick louder law as you might recall he in ordered years ago and for so many years the or the victim of these felonies never had a voice in the in the process so this poor family has had to live for decades now with um\nA without really having any say so it all through the entire process the prosecution or even through the ... process is very limited and this is um the may be called the Randall kick louder law a and Morsi's law fits of course but families have been victims of violent crimes\nOr for for too long the um the criminal has that all the rights you know this one for the first time a gets these families the opportunity to ah to be part of the process instead of being closed out of the process of 'em is proud of this particular amendment as any that we've done\nA fantastic ... and ... years in fact they've they've got a pro pro ad for that with a Kelsey grammar yes at the ... that that's very very good\nAnd people just never been a victim of the the families of those victims in Europe ... as much a victim as the victim itself and whenever you're the family yeah 'cause you live with this for the rest of your life and it's and it's a big deal\nNot only when you don't know where the person's going to be released or anything like that that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't sit well with either no a run Steven's with us or this morning what what other things are on your mind not working right now around as we look at this this election coming down the pike here\nSee I like the only amendments on NDSU not there for just a little illness I like the Fifth Amendment as well as to what school systems\nAre and it's only one in Atlanta where there's a problem and you have the school system that's being held hostage ongoing it where you might have a county that has multiple school systems in there you know some of those might only have a few students\nSo they hold up the entire east boss process um if they don't get all the money out of it in other words it's a\nIt's a way of the highway\nYeah it's it's I'm I'm a I I don't want to use the word extortion but that's kind of [laughter] and that's the way that they've got it so they're not going to allow the process to go through unless they get most of the money so\nIt's not only their counties east boss but the other county as well so this is a leveling the playing field people will for me so I like all the amendments and I like the uh\nUh the questions um for property taxes on a which is very similar to Stevens day I might add and that's in um gosh just going on since night two thousand I Believe in nearly two decades and\nAn over Seventy tax taxing district so over the state have copied Stevens day so yeah it's it's pretty amazing where this has gone\nThat I thought of you and I was voting yes on that because\nIt's it's it's really interesting and and we got a long way to go and property taxes as well\nYou know that there was one of the things that they're talking about if you own a tree farm for example you're in your your growing trees and we need them for either lumber over paper or whatever it is we need a renewal resource\nAh some of the counties or whatever the state wants to tax you on what they could do developing it exactly so it's ... it's it's pie in the sky type thing and it can be intimate develop anything\nAmendment three that's also a big one in it that some of these counties want attacked you like you're going to have condos on it truth is it takes Twenty years without any income off these at all\nOr to be able to um make sure that their tax and conservation type um method if you will so they get all of these amendments are good hope everybody but for all of them are right to\nKnow run statements in here with us this morning here nine four seven drone night if you'd like to talk to them yes ma'am\nMichelle just called us on the hotline she ... she explained the backup from that

you brought that up it's and that's over ... district but the um there's going to be a connection but in this work between two counties and and uh there's going to be a connection that will bypass some of this traffic on how it's only one\nThat will connect over to bitten boulevard in Chatham county and and hook directly into Jimmy looked parkway or that they're working on as we speak says a lot of this traffic that goes up highway thirty is I'm going to be diverted 'em or can be diverted over to the gym and a load of boulevard\nAnd uh and it is a problem I've uh just uh the diverging diamond has made an enormous amount of a difference and the folks trying to get to and from work with him county\nWay and suddenly it was a nothing has been amazing I said you know when it when I

congressional district a deal to representatives name as an for sale and she just happens to be the chairman of the board so we got a little bit of clout and how to get things moving\nWell we'll just having him project what's the timeline on that one\nOr we talk to them last year it is the coordination between the two counties because both will have to make this work and you know no no roads stop at county lines they continue to go to another yeah that's a that's been worked out I spoke to the commissioner of Chatham county here are just a few months ago and that's that's in the works\nThat
