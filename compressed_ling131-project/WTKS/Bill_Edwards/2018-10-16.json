is a how'd you find out there so be careful with that [noise]\nFourteen minutes mega fifty minutes six o'clock we kind of our President Trump as a busy week ahead the situation with Saudi Arabia still up in the air and with the first lady just returned from a hurricane zone\nAnd Michael by our NBC Radio news in the swamp Michael what's the story I Believe as we speak a secretary of state Mike Pompeo is having lunch with the Saudis\nYeah and that's on the heels of the show you family the reporter for the Washington Post a calling for an investigation in in regards to his death and what has happened we now know\nThat he's been missing for for going on close to two weeks here and we also know that there had been different stories coming out from Saudi Arabia we do know that the president had a twenty minute phone call it the Saudi king yesterday and then said that he didn't want to get into the king's mind but it sounded like maybe there were some roadkill is involved with the death of ...\nUm so he kind of ... that is a possibility base that who knows we're trying to get to the bottom of it sue him but it was a flat denial coming up from the king now we're hearing reports that\nThe Saudis want to sort of change their statement and they're preparing to acknowledge the death\nOf Jamal shockey happen as a result of a botched interrogation so\nThere's that there's also is a possibility of footage that was recorded from his I watch is I was apple watch 'em that had some footage of this going down so again all of this we're still waiting to see what the statement is going to be\nAnd how the president will react to that but at this point in time the story seems to keep changing and the president again the one who keeps asserting and I think this is very important to recognize what people say oh he's believing the king or you\nKnow no no he said from the get go in and saying now we're going to get to the bottom of it there's an investigation on let's see the investigation through and get all the information before making any decisions and he stands by that now\nMichael by our NBC Radio news in Washington reports are that the the king himself or others crown prince was sort of left out of the loop perhaps ... so he can have plausible deniability absorb it\nDoesn't sound out of the question does it I mean you kind of I mean maybe I've seen too many a law and order episode but it would seem as though that would be something that would possibly happen here you would try to do whatever you could have plausible deniability for somebody of that kind of power so\nUm there's a possibility that that also offers up the ability for you to change your story multiple times down the roads were already kind of seeing here today so\nUm whether or not we see any direct correlation back to the king on this one I don't know if we're going to see that\nYou know there are reports that there was a a a team that was sent in to go get rid of the body and and\nAnd to take a shaggy and and then with bones has taken apart on some level that team denying that I'm at this point in time it would seem as though until until this information comes out whatever the statement is they're going to roll with\n'em and until that time it just seems like there's been nothing but deny deny deny in regards to that fact so again we'll have to see what technically they're willing to admit to hear if indeed they are saying that it was indeed a botched interrogation what was involved in that interrogation were there any bones saws involved in that territory Asian because then we might see more stories coming up\nMhm in the news right is Michael ... Michael I did read that there was a fresh coat of paint in parts of the embassy but also you mentioned the preparing to make a statement that it was a botched investigation I first of all the headline yesterday 'round dinnertime I would've thought it would have changed by now\nIt you would think you would think it would either change or you would have a solid statement that's coming out on some of I Can't figure out what's taking them so long to get this information out to us so\nYeah that's that's definitely a portion of the paint job there were reports that as a a team Turkish investigative team were making their way to the embassy cleaning crew was coming out of the embassy was in cleaning crew that it just freshly clean the inside of the embassy is coming up so\nI don't know what kind of DNA you're necessarily going to get from that\nAlthough there were reports that they were taking away like parts of a front gate a and other elements of soil and dirt from around the area so I mean listen I I don't know what they're going to come up with and maybe it will just support the fact that there is a possibility that there was a botched interrogation\nThat went down but in any case it it does seem as though the Saudis or at least one or two steps closer to admitting that there was a dead at their best whether it was because of an a botched interrogation or hit put on a journalist\nYeah and what kind of regime do you have to have to have a bone sewing expert or those who\nHave that habit of not something I don't know you could do that as a carry on and on your on your luggage I had no idea\nNBC radios Michael Bell or on the president's activities including courses visit here to Georgia and Florida yesterday\nYeah a little heat in the first lady making their way to both Florida edit Georgia there because I mean I think what what people tend to think about initially is obviously the damage and the and the destruction that you see in Mexico beach and and the concern for the people getting food and water they're still two hundred and forty thousand people without power in this heat\nDown there in the Florida Panhandle but there's still another portion of that which is\nThe the wins in the rain and the flooding that came through your state there and has given an estimated two billion dollars worth of it with an economic damage a through agriculture alone so when President Trump\nAnd the first lady went to Florida they handed out some water they said that they felt that the first responders has done a great job you said that everything they've done a everyone had been incredible uh he was met in Florida by governor Rick Scott FEMA administrator Brock Long and Mike Huckabee they were all there to meet them and then before\nTaking off to head back to the White House\nThey went by a soybean farm in Macon Georgia where they met with farmers in and tried to reassure farmers in one in particular President Trump was trying to reassure saying you're going to be okay and ah and I think that that was an important message to get across those farmers as well that\nThat there there is help for them and that even though this terrible storm came through and and may have ruined their crops for for generations they're saying a possibility of generational ruins a that they're going to be okay and\nA ... there are going to be sent critics of the

night\nPowerful forces in today's Democratic Party though are at war with that fundamental understanding of the American story\nIn fact many I think the founding of our country was inherently corrupt\nAnd they've made a decision to run again that version of America\nAnd the absence of an actual plan to grow American prosperity and keep us safe Democrats are in bracing victimhood as a political platform this mid term cycle\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams is running for governor in Georgia\nIn the asthma senior that has created through voter suppression as much about terrifying people about

Cubans and that self self to South America\nSo there was that and then she had a discussion with with day bossy about this who was a president of Citizens United along with one of the ... as a as a strategy and also what Jason Nichols who was a University of Maryland professor or left wing loon that he is starting off with a day bossy on this election\nTo issue in Georgia with Stacey Abrams arguing about voter suppression which can be potent argument on the campaign trail people\nAre led to believe that they really can't registered about our people are trying to keep them from that civil

want a good economy and they want jobs for a a themselves to be able to raise their children and educate their children take care of their families that's what they want this is just\nMore ... she doesn't have a campaign to run on good policy at anything real quick they\nSo one of the things that they were talking about is in the world stage but he was trying to claim that Brian campus is pressing voters\nWere going through voter rolls right now we're finding deportations we're finding people who were dead that are still on the road and you know did people vote for Democrats so that and we're also trying to reconcile driver's licenses with voter names\nMaking sure if there's somebody who you know two names that are about the same or something like that or or maybe the same spelled differently but that's what they're trying to reconcile right now and it's not like voter fraud or tried to suppress votes or anything of that nature\nHas take Georgia strong you can see also
