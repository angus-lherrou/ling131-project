uh originally these meetings we're actually supposed to take place last week but as we know hurricane Michael kind of a young messed up a few of our plans are what are you in any of it though the\nTown hall meetings are actually going to begin\nA the first one is night in district too that's with other men do during and this is all about the arena project as well as possible last seven project now we know the arena project has been a hot topic ah they're hoping to start construction\nBy made twenty ninth ... so hopefully sometime next summer before they can actually break ground on it they have to get to play in the works for what it's going to look like in the concept of it that they're asking for the public input on what they would like to see inside their new arena\n... we're told one of those like loading and we're told was reporting the WTO see Zach uh I guess it's all done deals to where it's going to go and what the say with a size is going to be although a lot of criticism from people saying who actually you know no concerts and if we want to have tried but concerts here this arena and go do it\nRight yeah we have heard from some people there's actually a protest or when the city held a press conference\nA few months ago people saying you know they really weren't sure about it being enlisted in a lot of people who lived in that area that they wanted to see more of um you know more money going in that area rather than just into this new arena so we have heard from people like that but yeah it's pretty much a done deal they plan to have it\nIn what the van and right now they're really just trying to kind of get\nOn the design and the concept of this new arena they want to hear from people\nOr maybe if you're handicapped what kind of things you

years\nAnd he just said that the what from what you've seen of this of the design that this is not going to be big enough to attract above the if we want to get major acts coming in here\nUh it's not going to be big enough for\nRight and maybe that is something that people will have to go to these town hall meetings and kind of speak up about\nUh whether it's you know and it will be enough seats or whether it they need to start thinking about a larger side so I think a lot of that will be discussed during these next few meetings but like I said Alterman do during the first meeting that tonight at six thirty here at the savannah civic center ballroom\nOr they're going to have that one night and then tomorrow night Olbermann Julian Miller district for you will have his at six at the

five and there are so many acts that we could get in between the bigger cities at a discounted rate if we just had enough seats to sell and I do think that we need a bigger arena than what they've proposed\nOh yeah you always see it coming you know a down Ninety five you see those big all four of us did they have the different things on the sides of on so we know that they're out there and we know these are around here are so hopefully the city can try to attract them\nReporter WTO see it goes back sometimes as to a short sighted missile and some of these people's parts because they want

access\nTo a vehicle to get to some place there needs to be an element here of now now we're starting to hear some of these stories now we're starting to get some of these reports from the journalists

governments promising economic retaliation there any sanctions over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist in Turkey Florida Senator Marco Rubio tells face the nation on CBS in\nCongress right now there is no pro Saudi element that's going to stick with our relationship with Saudi Arabia as it's currently structured\nThe Saudis deny having Jamal 'cause she'll be murdered President Trump says

after the Saudi embassy came out with a statement extending appreciation to all including the U.S administration for refraining from jumping to conclusions in this case so they kind of backed off of those statements and that has calm things down a little bit but having said that\nUh this continues to be a case with international implications\nAre not only a criminal implications but also economic implications because\nIf Saudi Arabia would be sanctioned or some action taken and who knows what the president has in mind or they have a lot of they have a lot of ammo at their disposal uh as far as global oil supplies go and they could tweak the market and make oil prices jump like you wouldn't believe so\nUh this investigation continues and we're just learning bill and Laura that a a joint Turkish and Saudi team will search the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul today\nOr this is where Jim August Yogi was last seen entering this consulate in Istanbul and that was on October second he is thought to be dead\nAnd build them for NBC News radio I read over the weekend that apparently his capture and murderers was recorded on his iPhone and sent to the cloud on smart watch\nYeah this is one of the strange things about this number one Turkish investigator said that they had hard evidence including audio recordings of cars Yogi being tortured and killed well if so why has anybody heard this yet they have yet to reduce it\nAnd second yeah that report came out that this was all done by his apple watch that recorded and then as set it to the cloud\nUh since then we've heard technical experts said no that that couldn't happen for a number of reasons number one is that uh you'd have to have a Bluetooth connection between your watch and your phone is phone was not on him he left his phone with his fiance who was waiting in the car\nSome distance away so they say that that could not happen\nSo a ... that's why this continues to be a pretty big mystery\nBills in for NBC Radio news in Philadelphia and build a lot of people won't be scratching their heads wondering why is this such a big story well\nWe've jumped on it because a number one cause show he had connections to the United states being a columnist for the Washington Post sell the Washington Post is pushing on this saying this is one of our employees we need to get to the bottom of this he disappeared and if he is dead somebody is going to have to pray to pay the price\nAlso uh some of our congressmen are now involved\nOr that they want to see an investigation into this uh for the very same reason this is a a notable Saudi journalist who has us ties and a ... because\nWe hear about these things all the time not to not to make light of it but you hear about journalists being either a detained are abducted and you don't hear from them for a while uh but this one hits home a little more than the others do\nIt was never NBC Radio news and of course you said that the president promised severe punishment Saudi Arabia was involved in what that what that could lead to and so only days before schedule elections in Afghanistan but yeah well you there\nYeah that's that's a another hot spot that's going on right now too is if we needed another one there's the elections are scheduled to take place Saturday parliamentary elections the Taliban has already called for a boycott and violence leading up to it there was another attack over the weekend that killed twenty two and injured another thirty two\nAnd five people have been killed in targeted killings are either are supporters of candidates or other

evacuating this you know it's not worth hanging around you know trying to think that you're going to be stronger than Mother Nature\nOr or you know the media's hyping hyping it up or whatever ... it's a real thing when you're told to evacuate ah and there is still going on from not just the Florida Panhandle but at the Georgia\nAnd uh up to the Carolinas and Virginia I mean this this thing was

the practical and expensive um so are you really are dependent on\nSearch and rescue crews coming through to your neighborhood knocking on your door or our and that just come out from the wreckage\nUm it's just a you know it has to be safe for the search and rescue crews to get out and a lot of these roads are applicable some of these areas are just unreachable because perhaps maybe you have to

dollars\nOh easily easily storms destroy again everything and there's a ripple effect in the you know one of the points I always try to make is that it's not just the fact that you've got to clean up a mess\nWe're going to be paying a lot of attention too powerful storm it was quick moving right it was very quick moving and the president's spoken about how that was a good thing for a folk but you know obviously you've seen\nYou know the pictures you see the video of certain areas especially where it made landfall in the panhandle of Florida yeah yeah I mean it looks like a war zone and you can take years\nAnd years and and also lots of resources to recover from what the hurricane did\nI'm In that particular part of the country so uh the president or adding Georgia to uh his visit a which is obviously important to uh to your date bill um you know because Georgia was hard hit just as they had the panhandle of the u._s. was of Florida was hit by by the storm\nIt'll be interesting to get the
