alleviate a normal amount of traffic and of course we've got more truck traffic coming into the ports as well Jimmy looked boulevard will be extending out so well essentially have a perimeter if you will that's a double extend all the way out to I sixteen and say you come from the ports now be able to get\nThese trucks off of the highway as many as we can with a direct route getting over to the

single landowner and the closest thing I can quit it too is the ah scared away on development\nWhich also had a single landowner union camp a pie and it took decades to develop that thing and it's it's a beautiful development but this is really going to be a game changer for the for the county specifically Richmond Hill it's got to be a good stuff and where would that be\nA development will be a five thousand acres that will start a on both sides of the uh interchange there one side will have a lot of industrial development with ... which of course helps gets the trucks off the road goes

as it can be and we have flood insurance through FEMA but\nOur lawn mower or riding lawnmower wasn't covered because it wasn't a high but we don't have we can't put it in the living like we can get through the front door so do you offer any solutions for situations like that\nOne a very fortunate that and and very wise that you have flood insurance\nToo there are certain things or by regulation that we can't cover 'em and those some of those external vehicles are things that we don't cover in the flood insurance program uh unfortunately uh we are looking at a ways to improve our coverage is and we're actually working on new products that perhaps ... expand that coverage\nUm but you are one of the issue if I think about oh where are you guys live only to point three percent of properties in Georgia have flood insurance alone to earn less than a third in the highest risk areas have fun insurance oh my gosh ...\nOr ... what is the toilet bowl Hong a he is assistant administrator for the federal insurance or FEMA and ... I don't know why the ... the federal government runs his program anyway ball to tell you the truth why wouldn't we let independent insurance companies handle this\nYeah this is actually the fifty the or the national flood insurance program it's a big part of FEMA because we see you're in you're out that survivors do better when they have insurance and um [noise]\nBut this program and it was established because the private sector really wasn't didn't wasn't interested in covering the flood because it is a concentrated risk um and uh at that time there was no identification and where that risk was so the program really that really stood up because of the absence of the private sector\nMhm a post ... ... and and it's not that much money\nThat's relatives you know I don't think there's that much money I'm very fortunate to have the job I have but we can tailor policies and I really encourage folks to talk to their agents and and find the right amount of coverage the right to ... um and we can try to adjust the premiums based on what you can or cannot afford\nAll there was a problem we had I think a couple of years ago and in fact it was right around the hurricane Matthew time when our our our beach here ... mile and a lot of them they were people were complaining and said look at it is caused because of the storms in the storm risk\nIt costs way too we can't afford this insurance is going to cost us you know like three hundred dollars a day or something you know to to to be to be insured and their ... how do we work that out\nYeah I was actually in the last year and a lot of the hormones that did really well we're um those that were elevated so I think a lot of folks really need to consider mitigation and elevations their homes a federal government and FEMA do provide grants at work and to the state um\nAnd ... a sport shooting foundation marriage there's going to be held November ninth tenth eleventh and Richmond Hill\nYes sir we'll have that discussion

White House so the president delivering some remarks on drug pricing John good morning\nYeah good morning to you build good morning you Laurie the president on making this announcement yesterday from the East Room it was an event in which the president announced a plan whereby the department of health and Human Services would allow Medicare to determine the price it pays for certain drug\nBased on the cheaper prices that are paid by other countries and wonder why has than any other president done this up until this point yeah I seem to make a lot of sense to me and others in fact the Trump Administration ill and large says that the Medicare could save more than seven Fifteen\nBillion dollars over five years than billion with a B now with the cost of some drugs dropping by as much as thirty percent\nAnd a new ha chess report found that us prices for the top drug could minister in doctors' offices are nearly twice as high\nAs in foreign countries so uh hopefully will notice this change in due course this is a rule making change the president made a and so there's a comment period but in due course is likely will take effect\nFrom a John decker boxers or the White House John was shocking to learn that you are not allowed to have this hush rule or whatever you weren't allowed to ask you a pharmacist if you pay cash or\nYou just pay for the the drug straight out you could save a lot of money we heard something went from a buddy Carter our congressmen who was responsible for this legislation said that there was a lady came in for that went from a co pay of Thirteen hundred dollars to forty bucks\nAre you that's amazing that's\nTo on ... unreasonable and only do they are\nAnd what you're referring to is a deal that the president signed earlier this month\nBanning these so called gag clauses that prohibited pharmacist from telling patients when they could save money by paying cash or a trying a lower cost alternative medicine like a generic and ah so that's something that the president also signed earlier this month you know hopefully these\nThese moves impact people all across the country are paying a lot of money for medicine that they need on a daily basis\nJohn decker Fox News at the White House over the president delivered remarks on drug pricing and and John you know we've set at Sean Hannity is set up for years he said these doctors it formed a consortium a a long time ago and they it's fifty dollars a month for a family\nPlus ten dollars each for a child and you get all the medical coverage what they've done their own to ... a drug companies they get drugs you know you can get the prescription Janine for ten Fifteen or twenty dollars\nAnd they you know free X rays the whole bit for this fifty bucks a month and then you have catastrophic insurance on top of that and gives you get cancer or something of that nature but that's the way to do it and let the let the free enterprise system the number of free market take care of it\nWell that's right and you know I I think a lot of people myself included wonder why you know did it take\nYou know until President Trump to do what he announced yesterday I think a good reason as to do with who he is and how he got elected yes not oh anything to the pharmaceutical and yeah and you know when you do something to the pharmaceutical industry you're not going to propose something that's going to hurt\nThe pharmaceutical industry and so this is obviously getting a lot of pushback from what's known as big pharma the pharmaceutical companies and uh but look the president is focused on meeting that campaign pledge that campaign promise\nUm in terms of lowering drug drug prices for Americans all across the country\nWhen John it is a double edged sword for those I can understand the drug companies they they spend billions of dollars developing a drug that may or may take ten years to get to the market and may or may not make it from the F through the FDA they have to recover those costs", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Edwards", "city": "Savannah", "day": "26"}
