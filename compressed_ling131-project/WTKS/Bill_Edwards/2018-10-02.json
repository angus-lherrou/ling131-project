Dr Ford said do or rip it could corroborate her story of all so that they either didn't it didn't it didn't happen they didn't know Brett Kavanaugh or they do a ... but she never mentioned it to them\nBut the best friend yeah she she believes her\nThan they'd be oh okay yeah\nAnd and there's some there's some people that you know again who who are saying that they've come forward and they're waiting to hear from the FBI like apparently you know one of those for that we are talking about was mark judge and the girl friend mark judge at that time way back when has repeatedly tried to reach out to the Senate Judiciary committee as well as the FBI saying that she would like to speak with them because she has\nInformation that she believes back when she was dating mark judge clarified how he felt about the entire situation may be different from what he's saying these that these days and that's why they according to reports the FBI sat down with wheeling Kaiser was to get some information and is hoping to sit down with at least at this point mark judge if not anybody else to kind of\nJust get a better ideas to where those people are coming from but that\nThe part that seems to be the interesting part here is whether or not this has anything to do with his drinking and and back in high school or in college or any of those kinds of things or whether or not this has anything to do with him lying like is there a portion of all of this is\nSupposed to be saying judge Kevin uh told us this didn't happen and now we've got this information so there's a whole bunch of that information there's been reports that are coming out\nA document that you can see on the line from the Senate inquiry of judge Kavanaugh just a couple of days ago\nBut they're bringing up six or seven new sexual assault allegations with in the ... within that conversation within that interview that they've had with him obviously they didn't think there was an inability to it in order to bring that back to the table but for some reason they put this information out there\nAnd it talks about a couple of different allegations out his direction so they continue the FBI will have to investigate it wouldn't be surprising to me that you get all this information by friday but according to the very optimistic Mitch McConnell nuts when he's expecting to have this on the table\n... suits me All right Thanks Michael we'll we'll leave you in charge of taking care of the rest of the forest hip waiters get it on their boots and shovels yeah so in Eighteen minutes past six o'clock so you mentioned something in the daily mail you just said there was no serious stuff on the daily mail what was that the more you did\n... ... well he mentioned the bar fight uh-huh and the only forty or there is um\nMark judges college girlfriend claiming that she's repeat it well I think you mentioned that you repeatedly asked to interview the FBI now or to share information challenging Kevin ... innocent quote unquote\nHigh school sex life but they haven't got back to her ... and there's the the other one the alleged coordination with the text of trying to hide what Ramirez had to say ...\nAnd a kind of see that I think there may have been another one but it kind of hard to keep track these days you know true [noise]\nAt the high school college and already do some of these really degrees or not\n[noise] It's Tuesday October second what's new today on the free our radio out my\nFree yourself all the best ... a gas station all in one voice rocked up every ... doctors bought a

wasn't my Denver county sheriff's in Maryland saying hey remember us we do investigations [laughter] where where they were the ones who should have gotten in the first place but if this actually happened\nBut you know if if there is evidence that they tried to hide some stuff in the past few months leading up to the nomination or that he lied on the stand last week then that's a problem\nAs well as if she lied once again he said she said so it's hard to prove and that's why women and other sexual assault victims has stayed quiet for so long long it took us to find out about 'em priest\nMhm [noise] well\nBut that being said ah we're supposed to talk about savannah police getting drones milk and then they said those are the technology improves sort of the methods of drug

ten officers from traffic forensics in swat\nAnd a big thing to recognize is that these drones are not going to be used for regular patrols\nAnd also will likely be flown over big crowds like St

Bordeaux war here where the on AM savannah at Thirteen minutes bass seven o'clock\nAnd ... public school graduation rate has improved some and a new grant to help them out of ... out of the public school students to get college funding is underway and there's more filming road closures updates as well and what we hear from Jack\nI think I got tied up on the air so we'll get back to him in just a moment right and as far as the movie filming road closures going\nYeah it seems pretty cool um I saw some of them that footage last night on TV but it's it's very ... downtown roads and trying to get back to that information is that you also try to get back with a Zach and write\nMe while I was we were saying you know check out our website a newsworthy cemented outcome ... the headline doesn't really tell the story this sounds like one of the use of millennial moms or something mother falls lawsuit after sun doesn't make the varsity soccer team actually she's got a pretty good case what you read the story\nIs is in St Louis high school and she filed a lawsuit after her son didn't qualify for the varsity soccer team but here's the story after failing to make the cut of diversity is quoted law at high school\nThe boy was no longer allowed to play on the junior varsity team recall the school because of who wanted to give a younger less skilled players a chance to play and develop their skills\nYour mother says that the school was discriminating against her son because of his age and gender\nThe school doesn't allow juniors and seniors the chance to play on the boys junior varsity team if they fail to make the cut of the varsity team which sounds crazy but the rural does not apply to the girls' teams\nOh the boy's parents fault the decision with the school taking it all the way to the superintendent of the district before being told the coaches decision would stand\nAt the failing to get officials to overturn the coaches decision to allow their son to play on the J. B. team they went to the office of civil rights and the department of education which also denied their complaint\nSchool argued in court that they do not have a specific policy on restricting older students from playing on JV teams but the decision is based on how many students try out each year\nWill should also claim that the coach gave preferential treatment to students who attended his paid soccer camps well isn't that interesting accused him of running a pay to\nPlay scheme something the coaches denied parents said that they understand that their son does not have the skills to play on the varsity team but they just want to be able to play on the JV team\nAnd why wouldn't they ... why why shouldn't he be playing on the J. B. team\n... when it's like they can let him sit on the beds for a while you know put him in maybe when they're way ahead of somebody said well we're not saying to put him on the varsity we never said that the boy stepfather told St Louis Post Dispatch is that we just say put him on the junior varsity team\nWhich sounds reasonable and while the coaches denying it is beyond our comprehension but that's another one of those ... what the other one of those headlines that if you don't read into the actual story 'cause it looked at me like you know here's a here's another one of these mom's just thinks that every kid altogether trophy if they just for showing up\nYeah no that isn't right you know it'd be well they should and absolutely should so there you go there but that's the share that story on our website at news radio savannah dot com\nI think that may have gotten tied up on the air but I heard him earlier this morning a WTO see doesn't know who is supposed to be [laughter]\nDisadvantage hadn't county public school graduation weight right I think he said is an eighty six or eighty seven percent which is good um\nIt's a it's a way that are from about five years ago yeah where it was like fifty six percent which was pathetic\nAnd so now they're trying to get more kids into college and if you have a kid or grandkid you've tried to help get into college there was a forum called the fastest form\nThe federal aid blah blah blah it's so whether it's loans or grants like the Pell Grant you have to fill out the form and it's a pain in the rear end to fill out and so the savannah Chatham county public schools announced yesterday that the city got a grant from the national college access network\nForty thousand dollars and they're going to use that to fund they project in partnership with the university system of Georgia and the local schools to increase the number of seniors applying for financial aid loans and so they're really focused on\nI'm getting the information out that they they have this program going on and that they want to help the kids get into college I think that's awesome and today by the way is the opening day of the twenty Nineteen or no it was yesterday the ah twenty Nineteen fast the application\nProcess so if you have a kid going to college next year you need to be on that next year the year after you need to be on that and getting that form filled out\nAbsolutely and by the way if your kid got above a very very young child or they're still in the hatch works uh then you need to start putting up money for college now\nIf you want them to go to college in the ... and everything out but because it's getting ... getting way out of hand and one of the things that they need to do and one of the things we ought to pay attention to in the legislature instead of the capital hearings is of the things that like uh getting the government out of the loan business\nWhether it's for our our protection of our flooding get flood insurance through the government or getting student loan just is adding to the national debt there's one of the stories that they don't report\nWhen when the berries to Toro ... bomber a came up with this will allow hair brain idea that have the government give you these loans for college and telling every kid they ought to go uh that's adding to the national debt because it comes from that comes from a government coffers\nAnd not every kid needs to go to university or a four year school there are really good paying jobs that you can get with an associates degree\nNo kidding I ever going to be the old joke about the guy the the the neurosurgeon the called a plumber and the guy came and he said for five minutes and he said that'll be a hundred and twenty five dollars\nIs a good lawyer

Chattahoochee national forest and so ...
