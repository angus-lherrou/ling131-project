easy things happening yeah ah they're throwing the name Andrew out there which is\nReally quite a while at the but\nThe ... as a as a Michael made its landfall yesterday it had spiked up again in a

yeah that's um that's pretty horrendous\nThing give it a a you know but uh the wind certainly ferocious at of course that storm surge ah which is really just a a\nAll catastrophic some areas I think they were saying was search it reached Thirteen or fourteen feet high in a uh nothing really survives that certainly not people are definitely not structures and infrastructure\nAnd that the truth I Am and brown and Fox News in Miami all the hurricane Michael latest as it moved through Florida's panhandle yesterday hitting it almost a cat five power just up like a two two um two miles an hour

swamp up there in Washington has the latest as he's watching from a bird's eye view Michael what are you seeing\nWe know that there is debris like you wouldn't believe out there that the strongest hurricane to hit the U.S nearly fifty years thirty wrong just ever to hit the U.S period\nA hurricane Michael now a tropical storm as it's moving out of Georgia heading towards South Carolina but still\nIncredibly strong with the national Hurricane Center warning that the storm is bringing damaging winds this morning and and we're seeing that that was a big part of the damage that you're going to see this morning in Panama City and in Florida making its way into Georgia they're not only did this thing come in at just two miles an hour under a category five\nI don't think Panama City could tell the difference I don't think Panama city's like we we dodged a bullet there yeah I think they're literally looking at what was seemingly for all intents and purposes a torn addict activity over the top of them for three solid hours and I think we're going to see the results of that today I did hear 'em some of the guys from the volunteer group the Cajun Navy talking about\nHow they're seeing destruction today they're driving around and try to volunteer and help people out or not like Katrina not like Harvey like a third world bombing so um we're looking at some devastation that is going to be\nProbably years before you see anybody returned from this kind of devastation at least according to reports this morning we'll see more and the bigger scope of that when we get a chance to see how things are because you've had six hundred thousand people without power all night since this thing hit we're going to see a bigger scope here sunrise occurs\nWhile I can just imagine Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington over what hurricane Michael has been doing and right now moving through a and heading to South Carolina and unfortunately this thing is moving rapidly are hanging around like some of these things do like we have with Lawrence or harming\nI think this was a dramatic difference too I think we were all able to kind of see how we we had a difference between us in Florence where this one was fast moving even to the point where you saw storm surge you saw ... levels of water you know that we're at roof levels and some over the over the top of fruits out here for\nWe're looking at it with Michael and then it was gone then the next you knew it was just it disappeared and everything was kind of back to what you would consider normal in a short period of time and that's far different from what we had seen from Florence but also these wins you know the winds that you had in Florence maybe Seventy five mile an hour sustain when it actually hit shore\nYou're looking at a hundred and fifty five plus I mean when you had a category three hit the Georgia Line for you guys that category three hurricane coming in from Florida there\nThat tells you what you need to know about the strength of this thing now we do know that there were two does at least that's what we've been reporting so far\nUh one right in Seminole County Georgia where a a child was killed a tree fell on during the storm and in a similar situation in Florida tree fell on the house and kill the guy there so the get the wind is going to be a big tell her what happened here not only\nThe combination of the winning the storm surge a win knocking trains off tracks in Panama City but I think you're seeing you know Trey snapping buildings getting hit I saw one maybe you guys thought to the footage of the high school in Panama City\nThe roof and rolled up like it was a ... cat a exposing the hardwood floor the basketball court or need not blown off\nJust little robot up there I saw that began Paxil\nYeah they had they had drone shots of that going right into the gym and it was just absolutely amazing alright do Michael you stay safe if it just it gives you kind of come your way okay\nYeah you guys stay safe as well be thinking of ya\nAnd there are some power outages in the area and\nYou know there are a fact we were talking with the Georgia Power people but to half an hour ago and they said that there was something like a six about five thousand customers without power in the area so yes there but they're working hard but I'll tell you my hat's off to all my heart hat is off\nTo vote you guys out there in I'm In Georgia Power lay on the go out and and whether like this or worse much worse in many cases or to get power of power back restored to us\nYou never know how important electricity is to you don't have it for an hour or two or or longer yes and we were worried about that with uh we didn't get the Windsor we expected I think we had just about twenty five or thirty miles an hour but they were talking about much higher than that or earlier in the week\nAnd still on the back roads there's still a lot of debris out in the road so be careful if you're driving today and not allowed to traffic has been on them yet\nAnd that yesterday watching the coverage on the weather channel with Jim can tore mhm of course we know he was in the eye in some cars that were you always find them you know he's out there it's making landfall hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds storm and\nThings start flying towards his head into these boards that are on the ground behind him that keep keep starting to let\nThis one comes flying towards his head he's\nA helmet to helmet and you know and the fighting\nThe wind to get a helmet on him and he goes back out there he should've just stayed in the hotel the the reporters from NBC and ABC they were all ... from inside the hotel yeah looking out which I think was the smart thing to do in Jersey from me ABC was really shaken up\nAs she watched the house across the street get washed away mhm yeah it was incredible\nAnd they kept morning I'm you know because there were standing up for those sliding glass doors going out to their those of brand as their patios and said you know get away from that to jeeze yeah it's a good\nAnd then a A R I heart radio sister stations down there to W.
