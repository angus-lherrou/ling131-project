people who die because they don't get the treatment that they need\nBut I think that's because we have a lot of government interference there are\nThere's a consortium of doctors because they can't afford the insurance that stairs or can't get care for years Sean Hannity and he's taken a before Congress and everything else was a group of doctors it formed a consortium a few years ago I think

yeah forty two year old actress booted this week from a delta flight now says the airline wanted her dog and the overhead compartment did they really\nKnow this this story changes depending on what day of and we have an actress was upset because when she boarded her flight she did not get the window seat she requested new nicely forced to sit in and I also see\nAnd then the person in front of her actually had the audacity to recline their seat just a bit which he just could not handle and so this airplanes taxing for take off\nFrom Los Angeles and they basically turned their back around and then back to the gate and ask her to get off the plane and they would put her on her later flight which she did complaining the whole way\nYesterday she came out saying the reason she had her meltdown was not because of the overheads or not because of that person in front of her or not getting the seat she wanted but because the flight attendants soldier put her dog in the overhead storage compartment delta quickly and very\nLoudly ... came back and said that is not the case she was told to put her dog carrier absent of the pet\nAnd stored the overhead compartment but certainly not the dog but yeah I don't know how long it's been since this individuals had a really you know sustainable jobs\nFor a while but getting quite a bit of attention this week and certainly my apologies through your audience for continuing it\n[laughter] all forgiven Jay wild United not following the lead of American or dealt us as its basic economy passengers are not entitled to bin overhead bin space\nWhich is the way it was designed a couple of years ago when the United airlines started this basically saying if you want basic transportation\nFrom point a to point B meaning that you're going to get the lowest airfare anybody on the plane and they are not going to receive a seat assignment to like we're about ready to close the door which means you're going to get to know to people by sitting at a middle seat the second thing is that your over or you're a carry on bag\nHas to be small enough that it fits underneath the seat in front of you you will not be allowed to have anything in the overhead compartment\nThat caught on quite well as far as these basic economy fare so American adult to also copy that\nAre pretty much saying the exact same thing those airlines do relaxed the overhead compartment a\nPortion of the basic economy fare saying okay we'll let you store your bag over top United uh yesterday said we're not going to do that we're in keep everything as it is and if you pay that bear basic price right that's where your carry on bag needs to be in the overhead storage compartments which are overflowing as it is anyways\nAre going to be left for those passengers who are paying a higher fair and I am completely okay with that\nOr at a new we're talking with Jay Ratliff iron aviation analyst former airline executive and meanwhile the University of Dayton video shows what happens when a drone hits an airplane this was a demonstration on their own hits an airplane\nYeah this is it the ... the impact of physics lab as their engineering students show from the flight division what would happen when an average size drone\nComes into impact with a commercial aircraft weighing at the speed of about two hundred and thirty eight miles an hour or so the drone would just be kind of hovering along you know and then there's the airplanes coming in and that's about the approach speed is an airplane is approaching\nThe uh uh airport right um give the damage was substantial in this video shows it and when you realize that\nWe're just at the very beginning of what's going to be the drone crazed era where everybody's going to be using drones for everything imaginable uh it it really underscores the fact that we need to have the Federal Aviation administration keep a very close\nUm I guess keep these reined in with regards to how and when these are operated\nBecause we're enjoying the safest Arab commercial jet travel really that we've ever seen in the history of commercial aviation\nAnd uh to have something like drones which were really can't control\nIt to be up flying around especially near airports and things yeah there are restrictions in place but I think the ... going to need to do better they'd been a little bit behind the ball on
