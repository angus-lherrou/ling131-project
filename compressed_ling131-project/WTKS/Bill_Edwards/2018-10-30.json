they going to be in Florida twice to one today\nAnd then it'll be back in Florida on Saturday if you look at Florida there's a a Senate race there is extremely tight\nA Republican governor Rick Scott in a battle with the Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson he's been around forever and they are now tied at forty six percent according to the latest CBS News poll that that's really tight in Arizona or a Democrat here since then among a\nIs just right above I Believe Republican Martha Nick Sally by three points that's within\nThe margin of error ... the president on the night before the midterms is going to be in Indiana this is where we see a Republican Mike Braun with a slim lead over Democrat Joe Connelly Joe Donnelly I should say this is this is one of those Democrats in red states\nWho has been in a in a real battle Mike Braun leading in what we're seeing here\nIs Republicans are the the strategy appears to be let's hold on to the Senate I mean it's it's just a toss up I Can't predict whether or not the house is going to go and not to the Democrats or not but Republicans are pulling out the stops here with keeping the Senate in their hands\nWere original civil and Fox News in Washington but you know that's been the problem with the Republicans all along and then there's this president has dragged him alone ... kicking and screaming and I remember Paul Ryan two years ago was campaigning on college campuses saying\nPlease vote for the even though you don't like Donald Trump please vote for the Republicans in the Congress and the Senate\nAh this this defeat his attitude they ought to be able to ... shouldn't be anybody as far as I'm done or you can make a comment one way or the other but I don't think anybody should vote for a Democrat or anything\nUm you know it's just a ... really bill you know I Do that is hard to believe but nevertheless ah these are some of these races shouldn't be be close especially the governor's race in Florida where you've got this guy from Tallahassee who's got more charges against him than than the than the hill the beast\nRight well I mean it it is close though and it's closer and other races and you would think like Ted Cruz has been facing a challenge from Beto O'Rourke latest polling I as a stain shows that he's got a pretty comfortable lead but it shouldn't have been that close no it shouldn't protect cruise in Texas\nAbsolutely not a\nYou know but it has been so that that sends a signal\nAnd ... and a lot of it I think has to do with a lot of the ... the illegal aliens that have come in and some of them are you know somehow maybe get the vote but if not at least the influence of people who do\nWell and and again I mean the the the whole ... thing is definitely playing a role ... heading into the midterms and you probably heard the reporting that they use them more than four five thousand troops are heading to southern border ... they're going to support capacity but still that the president is sending a very clear message to\nMigrate care of in a that you're not going to be allowed and they're hoping to make it to Mexico City by the end of the week so they are making progress and I was talking to a\n... he's been traveling with the Caribbean and he he said that they they they are going to take this thing called the train of death I was like what do you mean what is the train at death ... at the train right so you can get on it that but they don't buy tickets would they do\nThey think they're really jump on the thing and some of them right on the top of it Yeah Im risk falling off and then there's bandits on there and all kinds of stuff really dangerous\nIt is a regular subtle and Fox News in Washington and the right here in Georgia of course we've got you know that the ... putting a big push on Stacey Abrams ah the ah they've got President Carter out there campaigning for on and then the Dolly bomb was going to be here friday\nOr campaigning for and making a big push and they're trying to accuse Brian Kemp of both some shenanigans because he's secretary of state and the president a former president of the peanut farmers that he ought to step down\nAs secretary of state does the poor just for optics if nothing else\nWell the president will be in your state on Sunday November fourth and making and how close that is do you guys but\nIt's about two hours three hours\nYeah he'll be there uh and so it's definitely again with his schedule showing he's going to be an Indiana twice is going to be in Florida twice so showing that okay they're they're wanting those seats they want the Joe Donnelly seat they want that to flip bread and they want Bill Nelson out there and they want to Scott in so I\nIf if Republicans can take a couple of additional seats in the Senate and not lose any that would be a winning strategy for them and then with the house\nUm it's just too tough to call I don't know that there's going to be a blue wave though it just made me that there are some that flip\nI'm looking at some and Virginia that's where I'm from uh Dave Brat heat them very close race or the Republican he came up with the Tea Party movement and two thousand one and that mid term election\nAnd then a Barbara Comstock who is in the northern Virginia area which is turn in northern Virginia is its own little state is kind of blew me on the northern Virginia around Washington\nLou and then you leave and it's pretty much read up at the high population area and she's she's probably get ready to lose her seat to counter or by the name is Jennifer Wexton Rachel\nI'm vice president Mike Pence will be here in Savannah on Thursday helped campaign for Brian Kemp for governor I think he just come back because he enjoyed it so much on St Patrick's Day yeah\n[laughter] it rolled up the green car before and St Patrick's Day\nOh well that's that's exciting and there are a lot of places that are out there campaigning not only the ones who are\nUp for reelection but some lawmakers who are just throwing their support behind a colleague and that's the reason why the hills just pretty much goes down right now there is a really weird to have a little hill the quiet a I guess I'll take the quiet while I have\nHeard yeah enjoy what you can or they'll be back buses and was in India and Rachel I think of the blue way but I think it's going to be more like they'll be singing the blues but that's just me we'll find out what he's doing\nIf on November seventh or eighth we may not know some of these races because they're so tight\nWell isn't that that might be the ...

all this happening over national radio correspondent for NBC Radio in the small Michael Bauer has the latest Michael is all sorts of nefarious things going on here what now\n[noise] yes so yesterday authorities intercepted a suspicious package in downtown Atlanta and the post office that was addressed to CNN and it looked similar to other male pieces that were delivered to prominent Democrats as well as the time Warner center\nA and the FBI recording to report your says it was almost exactly the same it had the same sort of markings on at the same stamping a element it had the the same kind of labeling all the same things that were delivered in the packages that we're all a according to the FBI investor investigator Christopher Wray head\nOf the FBI if there were bombs were bombs that were things that could have gone off they were explosive devices even though they didn't have triggers they were things that could have injured people and is expected to be the fifteenth that will be marked off the list now yesterday\nYou had to face our say out in court or getting charged with fourteen different pipe bombs this may add to that we know that he's currently facing five federal charges could receive up to forty eight years in prison if convicted\nAnd now this one if indeed found trace back to him or maybe the fifteenth bomb package\nMichael Ballmer NBC Radio news in Washington a bone another suspicious bombed us we're going to CNN headquarters in Atlanta no Michael do they think that the authorities think that this was sent by the same guy\nThat that that's an indication at this point bill they're looking at this as a the fifteenth package and they don't know why there was a delight they don't know if this was all sent out at the same time they're not sure if you know last week's packages were all sort of sent in one cluster and that there is a second cluster that was mailed out and of course\nSince our stock now not really being helpful at any of that I'm being indication that according to FBI agents that they had from him upon harassed was that there were more packages that may be coming\nHe didn't indicate how many more amongst the things they found in his white man we're all of the uh they believe ah the the necessary parts to put this altogether they found the soldering equipment stamps on the loves paper a printer\nInside the van that was used as part of the labels according to them a plus the explosive powder all that was found inside his van along with a list of more than a hundred potential targets\nWhich the FBI now following up on a warning people on that list that they may be on the lookout for a package from say auction it not be screened the postal service nearest to them\nMichael by our NBC Radio news and speaking of um ... the charges here oh what about the charges were brought against the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter or yesterday Michael\nYeah we saw it and by the way I could have been a bigger difference between these two individuals when I came to the court appearances in in the case of a ... or ... you saw a guy who even prior to hearing the charges right against it began crying in the courtroom\nA space turn red was very emotional about all of this a while he was in the orange jumpsuit and hands cop in the case of Pittsburgh you had a up hours getting wheeled into the courtroom in a wheelchair\nAnd then very steel faced straight face when it came to hearing the charges right against him almost emotional lists if you will uh twenty nine felony counts including eleven counts of use of a firearm to commit murder eleven counts of obstruction of the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in debt which is sort of a hate crime portion of it\nHe also faces eleven state charges including attempted homicide and aggravated assault\nAnd and you're still seeing from a U.S attorneys that federal prosecutors also plan on seeking the death penalty against them and when he heard all of that and doesn't have a lawyer yet so it was asking the courts for a lawyer with all of that very straight faced a no emotion whatsoever as he was wheeled out of the courtroom\nThat has developed into something that he was not expecting to happen as opposed to you know the the guy in Pittsburgh\nOf ours who shot up that synagogue and killed loving people are clearly seeming like he he knew the job he was setting out to do reports today that when you go to the hospital he was yelling that he wanted to kill all the Jews while he was in the hospital ironically the first three people to take care of him were Jewish\n[noise] yeah I Know it's amazing you know that but that's that's that's the Jews and that's that's him know that that's that's the big difference alright yeah go appreciate
