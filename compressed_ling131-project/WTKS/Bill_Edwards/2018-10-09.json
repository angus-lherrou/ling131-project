toward the Gulf Coast but it probably going to be affecting us\nAs our team coverage begins this morning here with Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington Michael so it looks like the storm is maybe not headed our way necessarily but we're going to get some residuals\nYeah it does look like it's come in that direction that the plan at this point is that at least in the past the way that is looking in the direction which is going looks like it's going to hit a Florida and the Florida Panhandle area and then start to make its way it's going to get a little bit to the right and then make its way inland from there so\nRight now it's a it's a category one hurricane it's going to possibly develop into a category two and three\nPossibly later on a date right now they're saying it's a mighty big threat to some three hundred miles of Florida coastline a Governor Scott saying that it's got the potential to be a monster storm with the the trifecta if you will the storm surge flooding and the winds all in play here so\nAh states of emergency had been called there are some indications that\nToday would be the last day for anybody in the past the storm to get out of the way the storm because come tomorrow morning when the winds are kind of whipping through there and this is expected to hit\nA Wednesday morning to mid day on some level and then really be moving forward in the afternoon a right now Ninety mile an hour winds\nThat's going to pick up to probably somewhere in the range of a hundred and eleven or higher even a hundred and twenty before makes landfall and again that's expected to be happening\nOr going into tomorrow morning mid morning into the afternoon and then as we know from Florence the surge was huge debt right we're looking at eight to twelve foot storm surge which is the most deadly part of the storm there'll be hitting sort of just south east of where this ends up hitting in the Florida Panhandle so\nUm it it's going to be very dangerous disappointed if it continues to grow the way we're expecting we could have a category three when it hits ground\nWell most of our the NBC News radio Michael just this week at my sister's daughter were at Christmas Springs Florida right in the eye of the storm in ... and they left yesterday the place where they stayed there cabins had just been rebuilt from her home lighting and now they're looking at an even higher storm surge and that one\nAnd and and the thing for you guys to it for the Carolinas is that you know in in South Carolina is still there they're getting over what happened with words they still have that there are still roads that are out there is still bridges that have been wiped out and now this while it looks like it's going to be getting to you with with sort of the higher wind elements and\nAnd the same thing the parts of the Carolinas so they'd be it could be forty mile an hour winds that you're looking at the victories and power lines down\nUm that's not good news for a place that was just getting over and it's still getting over everything that happened with Florence so uh those kind of concerns as it comes across what appears at least right now the path coming across you guys heading up north a little bit there and then from there heading off to see that that that looks like the path that is the indication at this point\nAnd ah and and to think about what you guys and then in the Carolinas are going to have to go through after what happened with Lawrence is just awful right now\nIndeed to Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington me well shifting gears a red red in your neighborhood there with President Trump had his long awaited meeting with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and didn't have the results and a lot of people thought it would I Love the way this guy keeps us gifts and\nThe most certainly does that's for sure and and and by the way the the the thought process even was occurring for\nPresident Trump before they boarded the plane on air force one yesterday the plan was President Trump Rod Rosenstein heading down to Orlando, Florida\nUh to give a speech on law enforcement to law enforcement group and and the plan prior to boarding the plane you heard president say President Trump say that he didn't have a bad relationship with Rod Rosenstein he's a good relationship with Rod Rosenstein and even before boarding the plane didn't have any plans to fire Rod Rosenstein so at least felt things\nAt least for those two being trapped on a plane together and are going to have their conversation for however long there was no plans or indications initially at firing him going on that flight that flight so we know they had a forty five minute discussion on the flight and at the end of it all President Trump said he's not making any changes he told the White House reporters they would be the first to know if he was\nA so maybe in that forty five minute discussion they were sort of able to bury the hatch it\nOr we don't know just the two of them having that discussion we may not know what was ever discussed there but at least it's it's good news for Rosenstein but that could be bad news\nFor Jeff Sessions right because if you're just taking things from an optical standpoint and looking at things from a political element of this\nIt might look bad if you were getting ready to fire Rod Rosenstein the guy who took over the mall or investigation when sessions recused himself I could be seen as an assault on the D OJ investigation but if you fire sessions you're just kind of getting rid of a guy that you've promised online through Twitter and other elements that you're not happy with\nOf getting a replacement for that attorney general and and and that somebody who recused himself from the investigation that you are so concerned about to get somebody in there and I'll just throw in the amount that we've heard about Lindsey Graham is a possibility to replace him as the attorney general and may not look as bad from an optics standpoint than if you were getting rid of Rod Rosenstein\nWho who's is Jeff Sessions at my [laughter] he's up about fictional character we don't know if it really exists these rarely seen and that that could be because we've heard he's kind of short stature so maybe if that's\nThe good there's a good possibility goes if there's anybody that's been a you know ... a oh a a wall and ... it's been that guy uh I'm I'm just I'm just amazed that they were they kept him as long but we'll we'll soon find out and\nIt looks like this this relationship he certainly not going to do anything before the midterms that's for sure\nIt wouldn't it wouldn't appear so right now that could be a little risky unless something breaks over the next four which can listen to what ... what have we seen that has has noticed it into a world where we believe that something wouldn't happen over the next four weeks but a barring that I think you're going to see that happen a likely in ...\nTime because the the president will obviously get another I Would I Would think we'd get another nominee all the Supreme Court before his term is up but this time of every one of the second term certainly on that one\nIs definitely possible and you look at some of the older justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg on those she says she's not going anywhere\n[laughter] she's like eighty five the he survives pancreatic cancer she is she is tough\nUm so but there could be another opening before a President Trump is out of office and well I you know I guess one can just hope that we learn lessons from this confirmation process and\nI Would hope that it would be a different kind of scenario because I don't think anyone wants to relive and and the entire nation doesn't want to relive anything like that I\nHope so too Murray thank you Rachel we appreciate it Rachel Sutherland Fox News in Washington yeah but so far from what I've seen the media and the Democrats have doubled

twelve years\nUnless we take action ah now here here's what they're talking about I they they track of\nCourse the rise in global temperatures and the goal has been\nTo keep global temperatures from rising more than one point five degrees Celsius which is about through almost three degrees Fahrenheit ... ... ... over what are called pre industrial levels that dates back a hundred fifty years so they're saying okay\nIf those temperatures rising doesn't sound like a whole lot but if those temperatures rise by three degrees globally\nUh the average temperature we will see\nCourse rising sea levels due to Arctic melting not extreme drought in some areas wildfires of floods of food shortages in ... and what they call climate refugees people who were forced to leave their homes because of severe weather conditions\nOn top of this of course we've all heard the reports about how global warming and increased water temperatures ocean temperatures can help strengthen\nThe hurricanes that we have been getting and are preparing for once again down south uh so I you know this is something they say will happen by the year twenty thirty unless\nWe get our act together immediately and what

latest is Michael is really going to be a major hurricane or something that was not I don't believe it was really predicted twenty four hours ago a Michael will impact the panhandle of Florida\nAnd uh well not just impacted with its waves but also a rain storm surge storm surge along the Florida Panhandle\nIt's ... ... ... uh the uh rain will also be plentiful\nAnd especially if it holds its a major categories status or\nA you know will will be pretty intense\nUm the the good news is if there's any is that Michael Lewis is very fast moving storm in terms of its forward motion ... uh it is not expected to linger\nOn the coastline way of Florence in South Carolina right that was perhaps one of the biggest problems with Florence was that it got there and it's all down the street\nOr one area yeah up Michael will move rather quickly other bad part about it is an ad from the panhandle to Georgia the Carolinas ended up more rain on the poor people in the Carolinas\nUh [noise] but uh it it won't be at all just like when a even still when it gets to the Carolinas\nIdle still be attacking a tropical storm force winds so uh it it is a danger and it does require air and to be ready and

are you noticing a a huge huge flux of traffic headed into Georgia\nWell I I think people who are evacuating from the Florida Panhandle would be heading into this other George the area I don't think too many people get Ninety five is is a far away\nUm the uh they'd probably be heading north on on local highways more than anything I could get to Ninety five would would be a big big drive in with it have to get all the oil projects uh so uh\nI don't know if people are going that way uh but I'm assuming that most people who will evacuate probably aren't going too far away really they just have to get to some higher ground so that means going north of the pan handle that southern tier of Georgia and they'd be\nYou know we're under a tropical storm warning if those or watch watch at this point not a warning to watch at this point and those are the they're telling us about the worst thing we can expect at least at this point is some high wins the thirty forty miles an hour and a force
