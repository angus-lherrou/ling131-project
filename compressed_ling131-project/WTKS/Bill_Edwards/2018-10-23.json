involved there is no evidence against ... she didn't have a boyfriend uh there's no evidence that she was in an online\nA relationship with anybody and it then it also comes back to the point that even if there was and\nAnd uh and she wanted to leave\nA why kill the two parents I I don't know they you know there are many many questions about this there was one lead at one point\nWhere there was actually a citing in Florida in Miami\nOr that they said they had found surveillance video\nOf her at a gas station in a vehicle in in Miami however that was pretty much the bumped afterward because of the time stamped didn't really match up to what was possible after this incident still other than that\nThere had been no sightings ah there had been like I said over a thousand tips received a but

something that could result in something like this now one of the theories that's also out there now this area of Wisconsin\nAs a bad math problem or a and one of the theories it's out there is that it may have been a drug issue and\nA case of mistaken identity where uh the the killer showed up at the wrong house and ended up and it ended up killing two people and who knows what happened to the young girl\nThat's the first time hearing of that theory you for sharing that yeah a build semper NBC Radio news over missing Thirteen year old Jamie claws have any indication a\nBill or the the I'm

his results from a ... caught up letting suicide\nAnd it's a song it's helped many over the years yep\nSecond wind will tobacco Chatham county public school system is educating teachers now to help them help kids thinking about suicide nobody to see Zach Logan all the law in hero Zach what are they learning or what are they doing morning\nYeah good morning I'm very curious indeed you know we're learning from a school social workers that those students actually younger than ten years old ordinance shunning the term suicide so it is a serious issue\nOr just last year in Chatham county alone we know that at least more than forty people uh ended their lied due to suicide backing twenty Seventeen kiss your in Chatham county again those are all reported cases\nBut it is a serious issue here in the county especially within our school system so the Chatham county commission actually called upon de Chatham county safety net planning council and they're a group that work that works to advocate\nAnd I just got suicide prevention to date that meeting with different groups around the community and it actually partnered with the school system to provide training to almost all school system employees so it doesn't matter if you're a principal a teacher a guidance\nCounselor you could be a bus driver a cafeteria workers if you deal with student then you are receiving this training just in case a student comes to them and said hey I'm dealing with an issue and I'm considering suicide\nCycle over television reporter WTO see a Zach is there that we've seen an influx a ... and ... recently this does lead to this\nOr do we are hearing from more student so I think a lot of people might think either middle school or high school age students\nThey might be thinking about it for contemplating with that but the fact that you have to get into our in elementary school do you have not even reached fifth grade yet who are already talking about suicide\nAnd there are some cases where you know students might eat just playing around or they don't really know what you're saying right of course the school system wants to take it as seriously as they are um making sure that each employee knows exactly what to do and say\nIf a student comes to them staying out word ...\nThere was like all the TV partner WTO sealed\nThe school system most studying how to help with a suicide or people are talking about suicide and in fact I Do have have you seen the curriculum that they're they're offering or or what kind of training that they're offering I mean it's one thing for somebody to say you know the thinking about suicide is another thing to say though that they really thinking about suicide\nYeah what can be a very uncomfortable situation a lot of people they don't know what to say when someone said that they are receiving a I'm a did it earlier this year with the training\nThat they went in and out right before the beginning of the school year all the school system employees met with the Chatham county safety net planning council and they went through exactly what the state if someone\nComes up to them and said hey I'm having an issue and I'm contemplating suicide now with that they also have certain protocol that they have to follow of course they notified the principal and guidance counselor who ended up or go back and make sure that they get in touch with the parents\nThe parents come in the school for a meeting they discuss lays on how this can be treated and then the count for will continue to check in on the child\nZach loading TV partner WTO sea of Zach ... what's going on today specifically anything special\nOr the day they are talking but with a parent over at hats\nSo they will be speaking with it's not open up to the public but for those parents had had they are going to be they're providing that same training that the\nTeachers and other schools the employees are receiving so if the parents decides hey I Need to come to you know learn a little bit more about what I Need to do as a parent they are providing those courses for them and they're going to continue doing that\nFor many of the different schools around town\nSo I called and wrote always reported ... see on these kids thinking about committing suicide and even though she only goes uh elementary school students that was that just called me naive or whatever but I think a lot of it has to do with video games\nBut kids see you know they moved over to the bad guy or the good guy gets killed and they hit the reset button in their back again I'm not the only thing I Do know especially on an immature brain thinking that you know if I even if I kill myself I'm gonna I'm not really going to be there permanently\nExactly there's so many dated to it in in fact the or H R director for the city and it's had them kind of public school system I spoke with her and she actually lost a son to suicide\nSo she has a extremely high connections when it comes to a suicide and suicide prevention and she said it's a lot of different things that can be a lot of different stages\nYou know a lot of people might just think that life would be better with out them or that your family what you'd better watch out for them to the fact that they can go ahead and just in their lives and they're doing a favor but that's actually not the case and that's the message that they are trying to get out the student\nOkay Harry jak it's gonna be interesting to see others have open when it goes down and look look forward to talking with you some more about this I Wish we had a better subject to talk about sports\nWell that's what the as you wonder sometimes what is that money going forward that we're sending a and whether or not that show that's helping out their economies because if these people are ... continue to come over here but this look so well coordinated\nA ... I mean that these people are well dressed uh we we're not seeing any stories about where they're going where they're going to the bathroom and how they're getting fit well it did so so short story this morning that the Mexicans were feeding him\nWell yes the Mexican did offer a food and shelter and even medical care a lot of people refused saying they were afraid it was only then right and they get arrested and that's going to\nBe deported already a so there are a lot of people who refused and yes they did only with the shirts on their back sometimes those were pretty nice church but at the same time a lot of them are walking a walking distance of them are writing and it's through some very bad\nAnd without a great supply of food and and having to rush water it's not an easy track ... and ... there was even a video yesterday as someone who died and especially the body was just so you know there are some issues that are really horrible and in this\nAnd it obviously shows that despite how well organized it might be by some you know gay men with money I guess ... I it just goes to show how\nDedicated and willing to endure as such\nSuch desperate conditions that these people really are so the question is what what will become of them and really we just don't know\nIf they enter the United states legally they do face and and they just stays being put in jail or in tournaments centers uh and and a while I Am I going to assume the Trump Administration would like to avoid the child separation incidents again or anything is possible and\nAh you know it's it's really it it'd be seeing what really notes all these people actually show up\nThere and they didn't stay on and we'll be old [laughter] and there's more where this came from ...\nYes it is and I learned embroiled checking in with us from ah from Miami was going on there for a minute there all of a sudden it's a it's not like he was doing the low crawl through a pipe or something that the eight thirty one news wrote a Ninety seven point seven to twelve muddy WG gas coming up next President Trump's\nTimes the most iconic brand into booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I PO now high times in\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow is the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them you write for\nCall today and let's get started\nMore clean October twenty far from her for that one of my cameras can Rawlings on\nCorporate seven seven patterns are hard to find voting hours on local from Austin who focus on my website ... up over time [noise]\nDuring early voting from ... from occurring harmful\nRecord dot com domains your chance to be part of history and uh making busy at high time investor dot com high times investor dot com\nHigh times holding course offerings will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found within qualify by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and chairs and kind of stuck\nIn a ... year arc from both of them are from\nHarvey ... tonight as worse off running for removing your sample ballot and pregnant with a guy who can vote on all wrong\nArgument or in your home phone proper ballot provide information\nFrom like I'm a county board of elections\nThis audio is for your review for broadcast Internet posting or distribution of others ... copy the air quality urging on his property by our media Washington DC\nOptimal health introducing new Medicaid claims and Virginia and helping you get the most from your Medicaid benefits were more in line to go family care dot com that's family care dot com or colleague three three four six seven eight to five nights for Medicaid plans from up to my health\n... we're on the phone from Africa don't weigh register\nOnline and on the Gulf minute\nLike on my county board of elections what five seven ... seven fat or talk to your right to repair mine is I don't mind who are [noise] hope I ... in\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute of maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trade tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight\nYou imagine what's in your wallet\nFor consumers only offered by capital one and a member FDIC copies available in select locations copyright twenty eight in capital one [noise]\nBut eBay aboard homeless here Tuesday Morning [noise] it is the twenty third day of October [noise] Halloween is reached in a day away [noise]\nTwenty two minutes before nine o'clock and we were supposed to be talking with John decker Fox News or the White House but they apparently we're having trouble getting in touch [noise] nevertheless the president was out there campaigning in Texas yesterday\nAnd the other thing that the the news media is not reporting on ...
