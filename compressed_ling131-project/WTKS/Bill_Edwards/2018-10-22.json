news uh Michael what's what we're gonna we'll find out what's going on today but when when we talk to you tomorrow we'll find out what's going on that\nFor those of us keeping track the mission that we had on friday that the the Saudis are saying this was tremendous mistake that he was killed inside the Saudi constantly it\nUh and then it was an accident that are gone horribly horribly wrong here this makes about the sixth or seventh answer from the Saudis in regards the accounts of ... being killed there are they ... if you go back to the October second statement\nThey said that to show he had come into the building and that he had left the building on harm so now we're getting something completely different here you know some two weeks later but that said oh we are hearing the statements now at least the Saudis are saying he was killed there but interestingly enough for them to say that it was this accident was a fist fight\nThat the conversation between ... and Saudi officials at the consulate did not go as required and then according to the Saudis escalated negatively\nWhich murder I guess that's what that would be yeah a a\nJob in a way to get a passport from a AAA recently and I didn't get into a fist fight with anybody alive\nYou may have been a negative impact for you but it escalate negatively so you've got a\nSaying that they are the Saudis are referring to those officials whoever they may be as suspects that were involved in this cover up and interestingly enough one of the facts that they kind of\nBeen Ramis to discuss here is that even though there were these officials that even though this debt was clearly an accident they still don't know where the body is so there's that portion of things that seem to be concerned as well no not an official statement at all but there had been a couple of reports that have come out over the weekend as well one of which are indicating that the uh Saudi officials saying that um\nThat they had said these are these people the people were sent into the uh the Saudi consulate to try to bing cars show back to Saudi Arabia and so when they threatened him with being groggy and kidnapped\nAnd bringing him back to Saudi Arabia against his will that's when an argument began in a chokehold was put on the show and it was that chokehold\nThat allegedly killed ... one of the other statements that has been made over the weekend was that the crown prince a crown prince NBS not only spoke to show you on the phone moments before that killing because she was trying to get 'cause she'll get to come back to Saudi\nOr maybe as well enjoy your show he was fighting that uh but that that kind of highlights that if he didn't even have any kind of a conversation before could show either his denial in an involvement in any of this or knowing about anything in regards to show you that seems to be brought into question as well and I think we're starting to see that from the president here over the weekend is well\nWell you know I've been following this a lot reading a lot over the weekend and this is the first time I've heard about that phone conversation\nYeah their their reports and again this this is you know again this is not at all and official statement but they are saying that that the Turkish pro government newspaper is detailing the entire report by the way you were expected according to president or the one he's going to come out with a statement tomorrow at some point detailing what they've been able to find through all of this\nBut he was saying the show he was not only detained by the Saudi team inside the consulate building cars they wanted him to come back to Saudi Arabia but there was at least a shortened conversation that on some level whether they've got records of the phone call the cell phone call or whatever maybe\nHad not only can show you on the phone with prince Mohammed bin ... saw him on but also that ah someone was trying to convince him to come back to Saudi Arabia just before the chokehold on the alleged murder from their\nAnd then it goes to understand enough certainly did return fire a ... that is are you still in town of course\nIf

long these are for Saturday's event and that's the big ... coming up\nNow or what we had our blogs over the weekend and some of the replies do stories that were there along with the ... was on our website at news radio about it I'd come\nOn the Diane Feinstein next by good old die slamming a student loan forgiveness program called for pro Walter and said well when you're not taught to listen to authorities and fight with them this is what you get\nThe book ... does come out for Bill O'Reilly killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history Douglas him said give it a rest the hunt for the ss should be over any skills if any are still alive they are not\nFor much longer let 'em alone let them alone God\nWill judge them Douglas I don't think that's what the book is for it's not to kill the as is and we know the ss as dead except the folks who work in the IRS but nevertheless the buttons give it a rest you give it a rest that this is a historical perspective book\nAnd I'm enjoying very much room only got about first couple of chapters but I'm joined the heck out of reading and finding out stuff I never knew and there was never taught and even when I was going to school and believe me that's been a while a Florida officer scene striking a fourteen year old girl twice during an arrest in a video\nThat interesting and this one but you know anything about this more\nI've seen the story but I haven't watched the video\nOkay Anthony ... student loan program is nothing more than a cash register for DNC most politicians like Dianne Feinstein seemed to get a bonus out of it\nAnd when you take money from Diane like Trump is doing gets her real crazy perhaps Trump should employed Bill Clinton than [laughter] he seems to love to get his hands on women spend women's pockets so I don't know what that has to do with a Ford officers striking a fourteen year old girl twice during an arrest but there you go that's when the Feinstein story\nBut yeah die in fights or does it the student loan program as is such a ... is a ruse what a joke that the federal government this was another reason to thing um so yeah I better research or I'm Sorry okay ... okay that's\nA but I mean it but uh this was you know another another one of the ... greatest hits\nThat we got this student loan program it's all under the federal government so that goes into the national debt people's at the national debt is going up and we're not concerned about we are concerned about it\nBut because the government's giving out the loan money and then ... and ... and ... the new it was going to get big like this and they say okay well we'll forget it\nForget it\nThat's billions and you know could it could be up to a trillion dollars or more of the student students ought to\nYeah he keeps by the way that you guys find the ... person yet\nNo we have it [laughter] sorry I didn't mean to go with the story and then taken aback and\nCasey do no we've uh we've been looking for somebody who vandalized or some of our historic monuments including Nathaniel green or putting these Google your eyes on at least they didn't destroy didn't didn't you know spray paint 'em like somebody that about Fifteen Twenty years ago\nAnd steal general before sword and all that Rachel southern with us from Fox News in Washington about the midterms couple of weeks away we're all with a rally is taking place and what does what does Obama doing to uh to to help the Democratic cause I Hope will be gets the Republicans out the vote more\nWell he's been he's been laying low basically but President Obama will be and not Las Vegas today actually where he's a helping out the Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen\nHigh and said this comes after President Trump was in Nevada\nAnd he was obviously backing Dean Heller if you look at the a schedule of President Trump's rallies coming up a sore tells the story\nI he's adding obviously the case today so we talked about for Ted Cruz and it it looks like Republicans are really trying to hold on to the Senate ... ... you know the house yes they they may understand that could flip but if you look at some of the places that he's heading over the coming days this looks like an effort to keep the Senate\nUm and because Ted Cruz it really shouldn't be the type for him down there and chat with work\nAnd I just can't understand that he has opened up a somewhat of a lead though I'm\nFrom we actually his age well latest polling is about seven point by him and so this\nMay help a Ted Cruz over the finish line with President heading down there and it's it's timely with the caravan are now coming towards\nTexas yeah we're not going to launch shake yeah we're talking with Fox News radio Rachel settling in Washington about the midterms which are two weeks from tomorrow or Rachel a so so so I'm a ... ...\nIs going to Las Vegas it is the same place he told people not to go when he first became president and cost a mullet money and and stuff to do people to stay away from the from Las Vegas\nI Believe so this is a different time and I'm definitely getting out and trying to he's been laying low a former President Obama came out I guess a couple of months ago with the list of endorsements yeah now I\nThink there he's he's getting back out there and Joe Biden actually is going to be campaigning as well\nThere is there's a dream come true [laughter] don't below yeah let's see if he it let's\nSee if he managed to do something awkward like her at a time he was asking a I guess I got to stand\nUp and the guy the guy in a wheelchair to stand up Yeah Yup yup that if if that had been a Republican Rachel that would still be in the headlines you know that\nWell I remember the moment I look at Joe Biden is\nLikeable guy had a chance to meet him he's\nOh can't light full and like the guy in or yeah you'd you'd love to you know play golf with him or have a beer or something like that but as far as far as politics go please you know it was interesting or Rachel was recently a ... during the Kavanaugh hearings\nAre we kept the at least in the conservative media uh played a soundbite from him in Nineteen Ninety two when they were calling for a FBI investigation of Robert Bork\nOr whatever or his his his hearings and he was saying no you don't do FBI investigations and things like this the FBI doesn't that'd be just investigates they don't come to any conclusion or anything interesting how that ah that's changed over the years well it's interesting\nTo how the Kavanaugh hearings I don't know how much they're still motivating people are out there that Republicans on fire 'cause they were so upset over the way that now justice Kevin always treated you know and I think in some respects that Dr Ford was treated because people I saw her young as amused by Democrats and that is\nAbsolutely or ritual is going to be interesting to see what what what's on the campaign trail today they both still up there on the west\nThey while president from President Obama is in Las Vegas today and President Trump will be in Houston, Texas for Ted Cruz to that that's what's on the agenda

radio present in the studio check it out no\nNo more am Sylvana which ... fun news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve Ninety am you have a duty chaos [noise]\n\n\nEleven minutes\nFascinated o'clock ... here with you on AM so that as President Trump\nWas out campaigning over the weekend and it's still campaign you do is we were talking with Rachel subtle and [noise] she had me on Fox News just about a half an hour ago in which he stated that are both the president and the former President Bill Brock\nAnd seeing Obama were out there campaigning as well boxers radios John decker has been watching it all from the White House going to be joining us here next and telling us all about it as the president is still on the campaign trail I presume that Barry is as well so we'll find out a John give us the latest and greatest as to what's going on\nAnd as soon as we get in touch with it so I'm President Trump out on the campaign trail in Houston today campaigning for\nUm the uh the incumbent ... this this race shouldn't be as close as it is ... it's hard to beat Santa Claus sometimes for Democrats are promising everything for free or John decker functions of the White House or John what is the lady that was the president's weekend you're more than ... her\nHey good morning to you know we're getting closer and closer bill and Laura to the mid term you know it's just it's creeping up on us and the president uh today is doing a campaign rally he'll be in Houston, Texas and guess who the who is going to be with\nA Ted Cruz hey crude lion Ted Cruz [laughter] hey crew of\nSports running for reelection a ... you know some polls show that it's a tight race other polls show that he's pulling away from his opponent or about the president's going down to hold a campaign rally\nWork Ted Cruz and uh we're becoming best friends and I think you know what that phrase politics make for strange bedfellows here is a perfect example now the president this week at past weekend was in a number of places doing campaign rallies as you know he was in Nevada\nIn Las Vegas outside of Las Vegas\nYou was in Phoenix, Arizona actually in Mesa, Arizona doing a campaign rally there and also earlier a late last week he was in Montana all three states have very competitive\nSenate races and that's the reason why the president's traveling a well traveled out west\nTried to help those Republican Senate candidates who are in some cases are in very tight Senate race\n[noise] we're talking with John decker Fox News at the White House over the president's weekend in review and a John [noise] excuse me the there's some of the law they are a lot of people think that the Republicans have been re energized after the capital heritage is that you're feeling\nA well it certainly is there there are a number of instances where that's the case a poll seem to bear that\nBacked out but those same polls also show that Democrats are also energized and as you know it's just a matter of which died as more energized I think yeah the way or the house and the Senate will likely go uh it's becoming me a little bit clearer that Republicans are likely to hold on to the U.S Senate\nAh which is good news for the president I don't know about the house and I don't know if I'll ever having a good sense about the house because ... quite frankly there's four hundred and thirty five races going on it\nI Am not familiar with all that were under thirty five races like older people are on John you don't have anything to do it but not the house [laughter] you don't have anything else to do do you go well that'll look all those people up\nAnd get back to us All right but you know that that is\nThat is startling because there are so many of the house represents the Republicans who are stepping down will not running for reelection so we got an average of new people that you have to look at\nThat writes a perfect example of that are out in Arizona Martin the valley she is running to she's Republican she's running to\nBuild a hold on to that seat held by Jeff Flake of or ... or at least one term and she's having a difficult time of it uh it's it's a tough tough race that she's in but the president\nHaving that campaign rally in fact he spent two days out in Arizona last week and he told the crowd I'll be back uh so that's pretty remarkable and he'll be back to Arizona with you know we're looking at all of about two weeks to go until election day\nWill join he's been to John decker Fox News at the White House so the President Trump's weekend at John this guy's been\nDoing a lot of campaigning in flyover country I think is one of the reasons he won the election I mean I think I've been to Montana three or four times now I don't remember a sitting president ever going to Montana\nNo that that's very true but here's an instance where\nAnd I am President Trump is stepping in on cruises be happens to the Senate there isn't a tough reelection fight with Democrats NATO O'Rourke talks is Evan round former President Obama campaigns for Democrats in Nevada today is the Fox news [noise]\nI'm telling you the local news or\nMaybe if they hear the news with family that's

France and Germany all issuing a joint statement\nExpressing the shock of the death and saying that nothing can justify this killing condemning the strongest possible terms I think that's causing heads to kind of turn in years to perk up and and just waiting frankly to see what the us is going to do at this point now it seems as though the president's perceptions changed over the weekend you'll find that we saw when this announcement came out\nA Sarah Sanders said in a statement that they uh they acknowledge the Saudi explanation of the tragic incident would advocate for justice for a shaggy but then you had President Trump in the interview in the Washington Post on Saturday\nSaying that there's been deception and allies in Saudi Arabia is explanation even after he had found their their previous stories to be credible a he said he would love it if the crown prince was not responsible for the murder but he also talked about the possibility of imposing sanctions started stopping short if you will\nIn regards to any arms deal sanctions like he would be willing to go every place else but he said that an arms deal sanction would hurt us more than it would hurt them\n[noise] that is a Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington over the ...\n[noise] some people still think an education from northern Virginia community colleges just settling the thing is that where\nWe bring you news you can use it to be\nPerpetual stores in Savannah voice festival is Marta who needs to go\nOriginally from maple known American citizen Marco says even the cooking and singing is in your DNA took him a while to get the singing bug\nMy dad is a singer is what I learned from him he told me to sing\nAnd my mom took me under cooking [laughter] so I can think of some great singers and ... and we've had an American American born they all have Italian\nAt nova or faculty or rock stars we're talking best selling author who writes scholars and professionals with deep industry experience [noise] don't teach adults don't you start up here for patients will a cyber attack I\nDon't think you're settling with an education [noise] seeing\nSomething from a an Oprah and the and that's how I grew up I grew up in my father singing everyday and also I grew up listening to a lot of terrible voiceless every\nDay for the longest time and I did not who wants to seeing honestly I was like this is not what I Want to do er here all my life and then I kind of failing to that then\nGiven a ... year rocks in both of them are from\nHarvey proper her tonight I saw for your sample ballot and pregnant with regard to vote on all wrong\nOn demand in your home your sample ballot provide information from a guy my county board of elections\n... the entire archive of thirty for thirty\nAnd universities play an important role in preventing drug abuse among their students\nJoined the drug Enforcement Administration and celebrate red ribbon we from October twenty third through the thirty first you can plant education and prevention activities on your campus to help ensure the health and safety of our nation's college students for more information on how you\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this level of demand the industry needs more aircraft technician we are the aviation Institute a maintenance and we trained tomorrow's technician the bureau of Labor Statistics report the average aircraft technician in the DC area makes over sixty six thousand dollars a year\nVisit trained tomorrow dot com or call eight eight eight or nine one two\nSeventy five eighty eight women\nAre often do fast person here on the phone [noise] don't register\nOnline and on the phone\nFrom his family planning part of life in front of them from a pat on the program I ever bought mine from our home by mark ...
