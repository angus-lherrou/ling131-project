I didn't want to plow right through\nWith the information that come forward and when\nUptick temperament that has not judicial that that will do the right thing\nTo say Democrats are causing delays coming from the same man who delayed the nomination of Supreme Court justice Merrick Garland for over three hundred days without a shrug our shoulders give me a break\nYeah yeah you need a break a truck and maybe you ought to get some therapy or so you heard president Donald Trump from a make America great again rally in Mississippi than you heard from other Republican from Kansas from Kentucky that as Senator Mitch McConnell\nDemocrat from Delaware Senator Chris Coons on the Atlantic from a ... a festival in Washington and a couple of other Democrats one from New York senator like Chuck Schumer and congresswoman Nancy lousy\nA Senator Chuck Schumer again on the Senate floor\nAnd this is the Merrick Garland a vote in this mode have absolutely nothing to do with each other a ... we didn't want to wish that with a lame duck president and the big we could not take his nominee and that's been sort of a precedent before so what's what is the latest from the swamp up in Washington\nMichael by our NBC Radio news is trying to sort it all out Michael what what's the latest on this ... dance starting off with the with ice skate\nAnd if there's one thing that they despise it's having ice thrown in their face yes yeah and let's not forget it we just even want to don't play a little bit more it was either in a guy he suspected was the singer from the bad you be forty\nAnd nobody knows what that guy would look like in Nineteen eighty two more today that would be nobody knows what that person looks like so that just adds a little fuel to that fire but yeah we know that we know this\nMorning the FBI is investigation into these allegations against judge Kavanaugh's in question we know that the lawyers for Dr Blasey Ford and for Deborah Ramirez they've complained independently of each other to the FBI saying that the FBI is not pursuing the important elites Dr Blasey Ford has not been interviewed herself by the FBI\nNor have these witnesses that she's identified and her lawyers have identified as the people that may be able to corroborate her story so according to a letter that her lawyers wrote to the FBI and complained about this or that the director and chief counsel they're having concerning that might be a little bit due to the fact\nThat the wall Street Journal reporting that although the FBI had until friday to complete the investigation GOP aids and at least one per ... per person familiar with the matter expect this whole investigation to wrap up possibly today it could be done today or it might be done tomorrow but in either case guys it looks like\nMitch McConnell calling for that friday vote this this may be on pace to give them all the information age prior to that ...\n... talking with Michael by our NBC Radio news in the swamp the FBI continuing to investigation into a\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Senator Mitch McConnell ... by the way a Michael did I understand that they still haven't released her lawyers are refusing to release any of those documents from this a therapist that she went to a one would think that if they wanted to prove or a ... tried to prove or story that would be one of the things they would release\nIt would seem that that's the case and that's that's a part of where we kind of seen this element of the initial letter that a ... at the very beginning of this all when the initial it'll came out that Dianne Feinstein and eventually was released the uh the\nNewspaper um that's what her team kind of went on apparently locked down mode and they didn't want to give anything else out nothing not even a highlight into this sort of the testimony she was going to give\nAt the center this year hit eerie committee meeting only to just kind of keep things together and and and close to the vest as much as possible\nIt seems as though they're trying to do that here as well it's not that they don't want to release that information but they want to release it to the FBI when they come and speak with her rather than have something thrown out in the press on some level that hasn't even been investigated by the FBI any level so\nThere there's a little bit of that being protective element of this that they're trying to throw into consideration but as you as of right now you're absolutely right none of that stuff that would seem to build a case for them and the court of public opinion and possibly even put a little bit more pressure on the FBI to go forward and speak with her and get more of that has not been released at all yet\nMhm Michael our then BBC News radio and Michael any word on finding out who leaked this information originally I mean she wanted to stay anonymous and and if she had stayed anonymous I Believe the circus would have been held more behind the scenes standing out in the open like it happened\nThere there isn't any word of the one thing that I find it incredibly interesting on this element those I don't it doesn't feel right now that either she nor her lawyers\nSeem that hard pressed to find out who it was like ... if it were me I Would be so live it that this information was released that my character was brought into question along before I ever testified yet it seems as though they're being relatively quiet again it seems to be their game plan right now that they just hold everything as close to ... as they can\nDo their best and and and in their camp they don't want any of this information to be released but\nThere's there possibly when that happens in my opinion you're going to see a big release of anger when this was all set in ...\nAnd it was like so I think it's all part of the book and movie deal they may weather but that's just\nMe and we watch this on the on the lifetime movie that week we'll have our answers\nTo ride a Michael by our NBC Radio news and Michael ... the the president last night the mocking her at a rally in Mississippi a that's a that's drawing some iron from her side\nIt has it's also drawn some question for people like even when I thought I was like well okay wait a minute\nWhat is it just a couple of days ago that the president called her a credible source and then and she had a testified with credibility and then all of a sudden this I mean I get the frustration I think this is all about the frustration level that we all want this thing to wrap up that we all want this thing to be over with and let's get to the vote here\nThat we don't want to wait anymore we don't want to hear any more of these stories that are trickling out like this morning there is a story about a letter that the FBI are at least the the new a New York times got to hold up\nFrom Nineteen eighty three that has Kavanaugh\nWriting to some buddies at the beach we could they were going to be having this condo in Ocean City Maryland and he writes things like a war and the neighbors that were loud obnoxious drunks with prolific ... among us I advise the radius to go out thirty miles and warned everybody in that neighborhood and then he signed this lawyer said that this was something that indeed cabin I had written\nSigns that F F F F F bark and now we also know that this bart oh Kavanaugh was a theoretical character in one of the books his friends had written and when asked about it at the at the hearing he said I don't know if that's me I don't know if that's based on me but here he assigning a letter is barred now does that titles together I have no idea\nAnd frankly I don't care right now and the ...\nAnd Michael are seeing the devil is I think it was Tom Cotton last night on the Tucker Carlson said that uh he he said he finds it amusing the Democrats are pouring over a Nineteen eighty two high school yearbook lack of ... [laughter]\n... number three um you know Jesse ... with us this morning state representative and talking about understanding the amendments that are going to\nBe on the November ballot and we're only a little better than a month away now nothing's thirty five days out from other than the election and uh so what what's um what's coming up next\nWell a minute for is another one that as a as a caucus or Republican Party should be very proud of\nA you may have heard of Morsi's law this is a national move\nThis is all about the victims rights mhm and so what Morsi's law does amendment for\nIs basically proposes an amendment to the Georgia constitution\nThat would provide for the constitutional rights of the victims of crime and so in our constitution as we speak a lot about the rights of the accused mhm we're trying to ... and uh make a prominent the rights\nOf victims and so uh if we pass more she's law what we will do is basically ensure that the rights of victims to a reasonable an accurate Tom we notice of court proceedings\nUm reasonable and timely notice all the release or the escape of the accused inclusion and in a scheduled court proceedings the opportunity to be heard any schedule proceedings involving the release or police\nOr a or the sentencing oven accused individual all of these rights of victims or will be now placed in the constitution and obviously this this uh an amendment as strongly endorsed by victims rights groups all over the\nCountry but just the dream sand representative on those amendments that are going to be on the ballot\nThe only one he says to vote no on is the now\nWhat do you think most summers I'm WTO's ... lumped into something they're national light out tonight trying to give you a chance\nTo meet your local police firefighters and first responders are going to be showing off their cruisers and fire trucks out at eagles field from five thirty to eight thirty PM\nSt James Catholic school in Savannah was given the twenty Eighteen national blue ribbon award for their academic excellence and national blue ribbon schools program recognizes both public and private schools based on their achievements for the latest news sports and whether please go to WTO C. dot com\nWith mobile weather ... hours rolling in from the ... the roadways this morning that maintains will expand inland scattered friday showers maybe thunder storming through the afternoon\nAt high temperatures today in the eighties the umbrella and hand updates on the news this morning I mean ...

had to cast change to pinky is not afraid to roll around with a pink cast ... in support of breast cancer awareness\nAnd now people are going to ask you may have been in a place of no but I had my leg and the cast once nevertheless ah a new breast cancer radiologist in town Dr Sergio drove me whether it's a and a more than ...\nGood morning bill how're you doing today\nOh man we're just living a little bit of logo [laughter] they're hoping that uh women should should be doing that as well with breast cancer although men get it as well we don't talk about that as much because it does but I was when they finally detected usually it's it's deadly goes I don't think about it I'm so early detection of breast cancer defense what's the what's the best thing to do doctor\nSo the best thing bill is just do the mammogram every year once at one time of year I'm ... not too long it's his Fifteen minutes of mom around to compressions for each breast and he can save a life\nNow and now we have the great three D. mammogram\nExactly so they left acknowledge it was being in the market for the last probably\nFive years but not all of this and this habit or is that three D. hunt the difference between two and three days three D. we can see better so we can um finds who bring both T shirt so we don't have to call back the patient that much I Know for three D. find cancer more ISI than that to a T\nO just seeing a doctor that could that could save a lot more laws because earlier we get the so but my my wife was diagnosed very early and in in her bout with this and she's a better than almost eleven here survivor no\nYeah that's it's very important to do it in ... in it you know at the start an age of forty on every year um my mom had it twice a she's like incredible she's Seventy four years ago and she's lost my life you know is it buddies she did it ... every year\nUm that's the important things to finding really early stage if you find it really early stage you\nBasically take the cancer out with one single surgery that maybe take this the same they surgery in and out um so early detection they will require just small surgeries list less treatment not that much problems for um for the surgery itself\nDoctor how to you know sometimes what to do because we say women should start getting the the exam I think it was once upon a time it was a you know once you pass forty and then they just starting earlier and earlier on this now\nSo um we divided I mean sometimes when these are funny you know it's sometimes find me a risk or like you know mom or a sister with these ... these patients are going to see their higher ... so this patients you start with a screening mammogram an early age usually they start with that\nI just thirty um and also there are other technologies that we use not only mammogram but we don't recommend it for the regular average patient that he's also MRI of the breast 'em to you know find cancer and I early stages\nUm that's the main thing finding consider early stages and some patients that they don't ... Easter they get cancer unfortunately get cancer early stages um eh we when we started ... each forty at least we can catch it when he's mall\nMhm steel oh we're talking with a new breast cancer radiologist here Dr surgery ... serves you drove me\nAnd what women should know about breast cancer and the doctor ah we we hear about some of these early even earlier cases are teenagers is is very very rare but we've had women in their twenties or we just interviewed one oh about a year ago was that she would have never made it to thirty that you're not found hers\nYeah so I mean for those kind of cases that thing I'm\nSelf examination it's very important\nAnd if there's any doubt of you know feeling lump or something like that to go to me to lead to a ... or a somebody that it will take care of that area there sometimes mammogram it will will be some cancers that can be mammography appeal caused by a with physical examination and other technologies we can catch them early\nI think it's very important not only think in the ... the ... and the lower I think it's very important also to Celtics I'm In and the patients themselves so because that way also they can see any any difference in their breast and that we can catch it earlier\nDoctor told me I have a question for you Dr ... radiologist with memorial house earlier this year I had my annual mammogram it was the three D. mammogram and because of my age and dense fresh they said would you like to take part in this new um trial for a three D. whole breast an ultrasound and I said it yeah and I\nDid it and they called back they said we saw a little something we want you to come back for a regular ultrasound it took them forever to find that with the regular ultrasounds they finally did\nHe said well it doesn't have a lot of blood going to it it's really small to be assessed so you can either get the MRI on it now but you'd have to pay out of pocket or you can come back in a few months to get another ultrasound which I'm due to go get\nBut can you explain the differences of what they were talking about with okay so we don't see a lot of blood going to this is a good chance as not cancerous versus what would look bad\nYeah I'm saying is air you said that you got the whole rest of your sandwich ... it sounds fantastic when they tell you that I'm not a great believer hold wrestled for some because some fortunately\nYou can you can see much more things um but they're not significant say it's not always you can see cancers you're going to see like he happened to use some something that he's ... he's benign or just you're Norma breast tissue\nI'm so that it brings a lot of bringing in all costs a lot of patients to come back for something that he's probably benign\nI'm probably when they did they ... they had held older son just to target that area that they so they need him you know that they didn't see anything and just wanted to have something that he said better technologies more since ... sensitive to find things that he's an MRI\nUm the the thing that blood flow it means um you mean there are some ... when their cancer their hobbies and because they grow so fast they have new ... basically what we call it which is basically\nDeveloping all hype and ... in it but doesn't mean that cancers are always have that so the inside so the person so not presence offered bicycle a tree inside of it might mean these guys are are not cancer\nGot it so ...\nYeah I think it's you have to be very careful ... technology but it can be used by itself it has always the hand and he has to be correlated with a mammogram finding\nGot we're talking with a one of our new breast cancer radio ... and the doctor Germany if you hang on for just a second here we're going to take a

in\nA ... this stuff for this illegal ... is readily available on the dark Web I mean the dark Internet as we know it\nUh you can order it over the Internet and maybe the most disturbing part of this
