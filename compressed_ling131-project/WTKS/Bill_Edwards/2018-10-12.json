solutions and that's what we knew we don't need government run health care system that is the last thing we need we need is more innovations just like what you cited\n'em but there are other areas surrounding that just south of there there\nIs no cell service there is no power uh it's very difficult to get through with all of the debris and the roadways and that clean up and trying to get people who need first responders out there on some level here two days after the storm hit is what is the biggest challenge us far\nMichael by our NBC Radio news in Washington over the after effects of hurricane Michael is still causing some problems up there in the northeast\nAnd Mike one of the biggest problems that we have like you said the lack of communications or one of the uh one of the reporters this morning say there's very little in the way of communication that some people coming back to absolutely nothing\nYeah and then and at this point in time even governor Rick Scott telling people don't go back yet there's no reason you can't get back to in some of these cases that that we know like Tallahassee for instance they tweeted out that the damage to their infrastructure\nIs the the most widespread in severe that they've ever experience they talk about the fact that\nUh they're lush urban forest the trees have been devastated the trees\nLiterally in a row lined up in a row just chopped in half by the wind and covering roadways eighty mile stretch of highway ten closed for to breed a ... and ... with that you're seeing some of that highway start to collapse now because of the flooding and the and the and the storm surge that had come through and just kind of sat\nThere a deteriorated the the earth underneath the roadway now that's starting to collapse so\nThere's all kinds of these issues that that just our safety concerns and getting people in and out back to their homes that Governor Scott has saying listen don't bother going back and even if you're in a shelter a couple of miles away from your home\nThere's no hurry for you to get back right now let us clean ways let us get roads open and and like I said they're they're trying to get people into and out of hospitals or need that that help right now but they've still got entire cities and parts of Florida and parts of the pan handle\nThat they haven't gotten to yet or they may only be accessible by boat or helicopter at this point so that clean up is becoming that they're really scary and the longer this goes on a devastating portion of it is\nI'm Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington over the after effects of hurricane Michael and Michael one of the things that they're there they said that do the people who stayed or or what ever tried to get out the only way they get out as much chainsaw\nThis point yeah that makes I mean I was talking to a friend\nWho ah who lives in in the area and said he's from New York He's from Long Island he's never used a chainsaw before and his life and here's a situation where you have to be handy with that in order to try to clear trees to get even\nA small roadway open somebody a local neighborhood a lane of a ... a street where you live to be able to get people in and out of there that survive this portion of it and then you've got it from the other side of it\nA local government crew's coming through to try to clean roadways and get some of the debris which may not just be trees it could be homes as we've seen in regards to Mexico beach it could be boats that have washed ashore it can be rooftops that have flown off of high schools are of buildings and in any of those cases there's a lot more than just\nHaving a chainsaw ready to go to ... cut cut a couple of trees apart so I'm a at least\nFrom what we're hearing at this point it's it's it's slow moving but it's moving and that's the part that I think that people need to be aware of it and with that as as fast moving as the storm was the flooding that's occurred in uh Florida Georgia North Carolina crops in Georgia there that had been destroyed already I'm not just the cotton crops poultry farms I mean\nThere's a lot that will have to be addressed but all of that comes after the initial cleanup up this devastation\nDo when Michael by our NBC Radio news in Washington and the Michael ... we haven't heard anything as far as what's going on with a major University in Tallahassee, Florida and Florida and then what's the story there\nYeah oh ... at this point in time and all of that still kind of remains the question all of that still kind of remaining mom I Believe that in both of those situations you had evacuation so people possibly still way to get back and assess the situation there or at least waiting for emergency crews to kind of get in and assess the situation but again\nIn some of these situations the only way to get in is be a helicopter or some sort of\nFlight on some level drone footage has been some of the only information that we've been able to receive this far um boats depending on how close you are to the coast but I think in the situation of those colleges those universities that are there I think you're really looking at just a matter of time before somebody can get in\nA really honestly so far we've seen you know the one high school has a roof pulled back and people who survived in that area just devastated at the thought that there were people who are actually house in that high school that was one of the shelters for people to go to and that roof came up and you were able to see the basketball court underneath so\nAs this moves forward here in the weekend I think you're going to start to see some of that clearing and you'll start to see a more of an assessment as to what happened in some of those areas\nYou know Jim Carrey Michael you have a good weekend we'll be back in touch you got guys enjoy or we get that you\nThink the news that amazing or what just unbelievable them and looking at some of the pictures
