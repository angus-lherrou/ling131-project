{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Thing up um you know what are they going to do you're going to drown them out so that\nWould that would be another option for you and I would do it while it's still dark\nBecause they're not acting when it's dark and you know you get that hose and slip it up she ended up to the to the whole get back and turned out on us you know and let us fill that hole up and that's when that's a good step in the right direction right there and then hopefully once it goes down you'll be able to take a look see where you are\nAnd then take it from there if you're you know otherwise if you're hesitant you call the tournament in the exterminator haven't come out and take a look at somebody else deal with it for you\nYeah but if if that was mine today I'd be I'd be out there this morning before it gets daylight and get I get a hose right next to it and and feel that thing of water and that way\nThat way you think I mean what are they going to do they know they can come through the water obviously but what's that's filled with water now you've got you've got them a barrier there without water you're going to drown what's in the ground and you're going to stop anything else and going back in because they're not going to go through the water\nWell that sounds like a good idea that a shot would be very careful yeah it'd be very very careful\nAs it's unfortunate thing but you know we haven't had enough cold weather yet to take care of any of that stuff so unfortunately they are still very active but yeah when you can't see the whole you can't tell where the nest is\nA that's a dangerous situation\nOkay uh but if you're going to have a buggy go I later I'd appreciate it could bring it up to him ... book they'll have a right\nWill bring it up the um also and and and see what he says I'm but I but I like I say that I think the phones are one of the best things to go after any of those because it really is a nice knocked down and secondly that water may be rich you you know you can you can go out there you could give you a hose in sprayer and connected with some\nUh seven something like that and spray the area again that do it while it was dark\nUm what's his daylight you know you're now you're facing may oh you are\nNow that's a good idea because that that that'll give me broad coverage because they were I mean they were hovering ten Fifteen square foot area all over the place yep\nYep and if you do that and he'll get on the on the hose and now we've got that wide spray a battle that's a possibility for you also I I think my first step I'd be thrown a thing of the water but that would that's my opinion\nShould just be careful and we will bring it up the bug is you know alright alright thank you\nJohn good luck with it and again those are things you don't want to mess with but [noise] um where I've had are you you know you had to deal with it I still think those phones and they'll shoot Fifteen or twenty feet if you can see the opening if you can see the whole\nUh but you know that you can spray with that really does work nicely I've gone where they've been in a light post lamppost you fill it up the phone\nWith that stuff just to is terrific but again very dangerous if you're allergic to that or you know you don't want to take a chance to call the exterminators that's what they are all about\nFlip them take the chance to get stung not you still keep in mind pleased would be very very careful anytime you're dealing with things like that um but seven se but it'd be very easy very toxic to bees\nAre ... and ... so that is a as a general spray could be a possibility for years well a dusting a whole sometimes where you know the whole is\nYou can flag it in dust around it with something like seven or around the top so they take them take it back in with them that's a possibility for you um but um again be\nVery very cautious water can be you know you real good friend as far as drawing them out so I Would keep that when it might as well we're going to take a break here at the top of the hour when we come back we've got phone is open for you an eight hundred eighty three to five five plus the tips of shares with you as well and then coming up at the bottom of the hour\nYou know every now and then we come across a good book\nUh that's great information for you and I found another one is actually written by a good friend of mine is called garden renovation\nAnd it's a book about transforming your yard and your garden into the garden of your dreams and you know if you've got an existing law in maybe an old landscape you know you've always wanted to change that patio around or redo the the foundation planting or create that that a\nSpecial garden or patio area or bringing the indoors outdoors um but not sure which way to go you know we've got the existing ... landscape now how do I I don't want to renovate that not only change it around\nNot sure which way to go this book\nHelps to walk you through tells you what they used to think about what to consider and of course Bobby and has written by Bobby Schwartz has taken pictures of all of the lawn and garden renovations that she's done over the years\nTo show you what she is done now they've made the changes over the years and it's a great example for you to look at the get great ideas\nAnd again get that process of what to walk through a measure looking to uh to renovate and redo areas and you're in your uh your whether it be the front yard backyard whenever may be\nBut against called garden

South\nCarolina Good morning gotta I gotta tip for so as hornets\nJak itches five gallon bucket up with vinegar but a couple jobs just to fill that bucket up does happen around found dumped in turn

Bernard Langer picked up his thirty eight PGA Tour champions victory last week at the ... champion\nYeah he again this year heads into the Charles Schwab cup playoffs as the leader pleasure to welcome burn hardliner back to the guts the Gulf show hello Bernard\nHow John it's nice to talk to you again\nIt's good to talk to you congratulations on the wind but I got an ass when that last pot on Sunday I thought you looked relieved or or satisfied was was was last week a little different than normal\nNow they're all very special but say but ah last week a was a was slightly different in the sense that I had a huge late coming I'm Down to the last few holes and um yeah it was a a little less stressful let's put it that way playing the last two or three miles\nOr so I could really enjoy or the atmosphere and everything around it but uh it it's been a few months since I've ones was a relief but the you know at my age you never know if you're going to win another one\nOkay so you brought up your age and it's ... sixty one years old do you work more on your fitness now or on your game\nI've you know work on balls for they are but um it's a icon hit as many balls as I used to when I was in my twenties and thirties my body can't take it so I Try and practice more focus to last and and I\nProbably spend more time on stretching um than I did to twenty Thirty years ago as well\nYou've won the Charles Schwab top four times going going port ... time is this is this about your dry Bernard being the best you can be I mean what winning at a time means what do you\n[noise] oh it's you know whether they win it for five or six it ah it's just that while we play for out here you know everybody wants to win their Schwab cup that's the\nThe big trophy at the end of the season ah besides a few other things of the state winning majors winning tournaments or being the player there are winning the money to ... there are other goals [laughter]\nUm but it's very exciting or to go into the playoffs with a whole bunch of guys being in contention or to have an opportunity and and to lift disrupt trophy so a lot of it will come down to the last three tournaments\nYou mentioned goals Bernard are do you write 'em down and you would ... center or that kind of player\nNow I don't write them down but I you know kind of know and I had a it's not a list of sixty or Seventy it's just a few of them are the it's a process you know their real goal is to get a little bit better in certain areas so few game where you can improve and ah if you can achieve that then\nUh the next goal would be to win tournaments which will enable you to win tournaments and then you want to win majors and you want to become the player they are a or the\nTrough cup champion and you can't force any of that it's a lot of it also depends on how the other guys play sometimes you play really good and you don't win and sometimes you\n... only bring it'd be plus game and you went to a there's a lot of moving factors\nDo you know somebody who has a goal is sixty or Seventy long\nUh no I don't [laughter] that was exaggerated [laughter] scared me here for a second we're talking to burn hardliners\nIn Iran the against the Gulf show like every time I have a PGA Tour champions player on the show they all get one question for me in that one question is\nCan you explain burned hardliner ... answers Bernhardt on that so I'm going to ask you can you explain Bernard Langer\n[noise] why should be able to a\nBetter than most other people that I Would think [laughter] ah there's about but that would take a while I don't know if we have that much time\nI got a minute I got a ...\n... ... ...\n... and a child I come from a poor background to grow up with nothing and uh one of more than my parents had so I\nGrew up in ... men do hardworking people so I I Would never shied away from working hard and that probably helped me a great deal and um and I love to compete to love to be in competition\nAnd I enjoy playing golf and I'm very blessed to have the combination of all the things that I'm healthy enough to compete and enjoyed doing it and I think that what you know some of the reasons I'm I'm been successful for a long time but there are\nA few other things that are very important to like my coach my cat in my family and so forth\nComing from that background Bernhardt have you found it hard and maybe easier as you turned into your fifties and sixties have you found it hard through your career to be satisfied\nNo I'm actually a you know I I appreciate\nThanks very much as I said I come from very little so I appreciate to many many things that I don't take for granted\nAnd so I I'm very grateful for all those uh yet at the same time I strive to push myself to to more greatness or better things whatever you want to call that\nHas has has it gotten easier to be more satisfying as you've gotten older\nNot necessarily know but you know as you get older you appreciate things like friendships and family and\nA face you know things that are really important or more so maybe that when you're younger you take certain things for granted when you're younger and\nAnd uh try not to do that any longer and as you as we mature we'll get older we realize well you know or how they have so many years left and what's really important as people and to relationships that you\nAre you thinking at sixty one how many more years you have left out there\nEvery once in a while you think about it because I get asked the question is when you think you know retiring what'd you can kinda do this kind of stuff but at the moment I still feel I can do this a few more years and uh where we never know what comes around the corner where nothing is\nGuaranteed to Kobe in a car accident or something else could have and the word could stop right away and I could be healthy for another\nTwenty years or maybe it's still be out here for a bunch of years [noise]\nA couple of weeks ago you you were in the recipient of the pain Stewart award and you've you've had time to think about it before the awards and a couple of weeks after the award what ... what did winning that mean to you or receiving that mean to you\nOr if it meant that really a great deal it's one of the very unique awards and the game of Gulf hum and Stewart ah\nWas also a dear friend of mine so I Know pain for many years a and a love Tim Daly um yeah he had a few falls but he ... he stood for a lot of good things and um I was really thrilled to\nA good girl so I heard a lot of stories about why you stopped playing Johnny I've never asked you this was there a singular reason was there one thing I mean I heard things like you know you you hurt yourself chopping wood at the house or something was there a singular reason why you stopped\nA more mostly burn out but I had I had a goal butter checks believe it or not right in that period and the doctors are saying title hernia as they you know really really hurts and as a figure raise a worse you know but um I went to the\nUnfortunately I think I'll go farther syndrome on my lower shin in both legs and dies right now three times a day of work I mean I just know that I get off the call but uh it's very painful and you know I've had that ever since I was in my late twenties so\nIt was and that's just some of you know it herniated disk you name it I've had I've had it so bad knees so I I don't know if it's because of\nToo much um many accidents on four wheelers and motorcycle really is and just you know being very very active with my kids you know trying to sort of so I mean I wouldn't change any of it but you know I have an accident and injury prone unfortunately\nBut [noise] but uh you know so that's in a long and I can't go as fast as I used to with a you know they're now same thing was probably perfect for how I was feeling and um but playing wise it's definitely for my career as far as long as ...\nWe're talking with Johnny Miller here on the Augusta golf show did you have to get talked into television\nWell in in Nineteen eighty nine [noise] um I had one for a couple of years and um [noise]\nAnd ah I told my wife and I just retired I'm not going to tell anybody I'm not going to not gonna you know put it out there in the magazines are on the press or in the press and um and so that was in the fall I was like in November\nAnd um you know literally we have the talk my wife and I said okay I'm going to do more golf design and these other things are\nPretty good at and um and I mean I got a\nCall the next day you know a at least ... you know from NBC is elite Caribbean are going to go on the champion's tour senior core um would you like his job and I was like talking Miller have bought for ... like what makes you think I can\nDo that job [laughter] you know\nYou know I did I'd never even thought about being an announcer of is not like in the back of my mind it I said nah that's what I understood that I remember I remember what the public speaking with like in high school is like you know it was like a nightmare you know and so [noise] uh but the [laughter] I says well we'll call you back in a couple of days and drag it over with\nYour wife and my wife's classic statement was hey I said you know I just got offered the trivia this job which is really a rare job is read announcer lead a analyst\nAnd that but I turn them down but they said they're going to call me back and she said well would be nice to get a regular paycheck now that eerie tractors\n[laughter] so [laughter] so\nThat that's sort of a ... made me think well maybe I'll Try but after the first day as the Bible does reflect a man who is two months later\nUm I I I ... I don't want to do that anymore you know after the first day I was one of those but uh I guess it was on a Thursday and uh but then you know the next day you know the guys talked me into doing it again by Sunday I was\nBanned the about ... on the\nYeah Ninety holes and said that you know this is the perfect shot to choke on writing or downhill alive over water he tried to hit it high in fat like you do at Fifteen of the guys the guys do it all the time and I was off and run and I guess\nYou you know do you find it amazing Johnny twenty nine years later you didn't say Peter choked you said it's no it's the kind a shot that could lead to that are you amazed at twenty nine years later people still think you talked about him joking\nI even have thought of as I said that we're we're we're we're partners and then in the national team championship in the fall so he has a good friend of mine and he ever all his friends that I I've said he was going to show and finally saw the tape ... at the end Hauser Bush in August\nAnd he comes out to be goes I've been mad at you for nine eight nine months and and I just watched it and you didn't say I was going to choke you just said that that kind of check to make you choke you know and um you know so into it that's ... times I've gotten in trouble summers but my own fault but\nUh most of the time was because people relay messages that are not accurate you don't do that from friends as a player but so you know I I spent most of the time on what I say I try to be very accurate and um and you know I have a cross the line you know a couple of handfuls at times but\nTwenty nine years the way I Am now so it's not too bad\nI don't think I've ever asked you this yes in the booth you've always been accurate you will you always been foods will to yourself have you ever seen something in golf Johnny ... made you emotional\nIn the booth oh yeah I mean like why labor lately I've been tearing up about every tournament I've done\nThat but that's because you're leaving\nNo it was because I was so happy for Tiger Woods finally after eight Seventy six times they had a chance to win this year or four times on the back not on Sunday and he just couldn't get it done and\nUh finally he got it done at the George average it but it was just still good for golf and\nYou know I don't agree with a lot of choices they made life choices but\nBut I've always full forum and pretty much covered his whole career starting watching them and the national junior against my boys\nWhere he won three in a row and then we covered meant to USA amateurs I'm at Newport a pumpkin ridge and watch them when those amazing ah USA amateur amateurs and that would cover result I covered his whole career so I mean for me I've\nI've seen tiger since the age sixteen and so\nI've been following him and watch 'em so you know for him to finally get get this when and get the sort of a monkey off his back and um\nAnd it gets that great when the way he is if that was big for golf and big for him yeah I heard of that one though all those\nPeople when they broke through on the Seventy\nSecond hole and they were all so excited that uh he was going to win and you know almost forgot who it was when the fed ex championship but the bottom line is that that was big you know as I get I get sort of emotional or you know and I said guys when they win or do something that it's going to change your life than\nUh you know I relate to it for my career too\nSo so after after you say goodbye Phoenix next year you're gonna watch golf can you do you watch a lot of it\nI'll watch you know I'll watch um especially um some of the wrap up things or\nElse at the time but yeah I'll be you know there's a chance that I'm going to ...\nAh be on the air or whether it's with NBC or something I guess sort of like Jack Nicklaus when he\nMhm does guest appearance guest appearances at Honda and you know when I used to work with him there up in the booth and they all I'll do the Safeway Open at ... resort because one of the owners and um and then you know possibly do something else that majors um you know just little stuff but uh\nBut on the air and maybe a little bit as gifts to is a expert or a handle those\nSo right than having said that in ... then ... we'll see if you will make me this promise even though you're not on\nCan I call your once a year and have you on the show it's a yearly wrap up off\nI don't know man in the year I don't know maybe in the middle of may be at the end but yeah I can I call you once a year to have you on the show\nWell I've always uh when you've asked me I've always complied so I don't think that it's going to change\nAll that and All right I had All right I ... I I think that the yes I appreciate daddy is Johnny Miller a Johnny I have I have\nI Can't tell you I never expected\nTo know you and have a relationship with you and that happened four or five years ago and it's been what a great joys of of doing this show of getting up getting to talk to you Johnny thank you for everything thank you for the for the golf you played\nBy golf you called in for all the golf you've done through the years\nThanks jumped Patrick I appreciate you and will appreciate your show so humid up\nKnow as as I said to Johnny it never crossed my mind that a relationship with born then I'd meet him then I get to know him and in the last four years or so has not only been a wonderful surprise down this journey\nBut it's been a great pleasure I Do have to see him go but but I Do want to see him happy and content it and now and now all reports are bullies in her will step into that role with NBC I think that's a great choice and and Paul will continue his work with box and their us Ga events\nWhile I Gotcha speaking of television let's take a look at the golf on TV for this weekend golf on TV brought to you by", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Augusta Golf Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "20"}
