{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Evergreens roses grasses you know and perennials you can keep on going fall keeps on going until what December the twentieth or so we've still got a long way to go and if the weather's right and the soils workable you can still get out and plant now there are some things obviously\nI think the smaller the container ... ground cover that was in flats I probably wouldn't do that we there's a point in October we kind of start backing off on things that are in small pots and the reason is\nIf they don't get rooted in well there's a real good chance to get get freezing go through the freezing and thawing and get ... down to the ground not do so well 'cause we're right at the top of the soil surface so we'll start to back off a little bit on those in some plants that are on a really a hearty miss borderline for your area\nYou know the earlier you can get 'em in the fall so they can start to get an established a little bit as far as rooting into better off you are I'm so a lot of times things that are really on a borderline Harding is um the later you get in the season the little bit more of a risk you take a possibly\nNot doing well over the winter and of course you're in the hands of Mother Nature depending on what the winters like\nSo those are a few exceptions to the rule and I put another one out there for you and that's some of the larger evergreens and not that we stop plant the images that if you are going to plan evergreens later in the season or any time really um which is one of the tips you want to keep pushing over the next six weeks or so\nYou gotta keep watering ... no matter what your plan to you've got to keep watering and I think that's one of the things we forget about when we're planting in the fall um is that we've got to keep watering these plants to make sure they have good moisture in that immediate root ball\nImmediate surrounding area and then the plant as well especially plants that are evergreen that keep their leaves and needles over the wintertime reason being is this deciduous plants that have the leaves a drop in the fall and then they drop and they basically they really do basically go dormant\nNow yes they'll still lose moisture out of this stems out of some of the budget occasionally but for the most part they released shut down\nAnd so you sometimes don't see you I have a really tough winter uh we have a lot of one of those in case you don't see it so much in the deciduous plants like you do in the evergreens but with the evergreens needle and leave the evergreens\nAs we go through the winter\nIf you have sunny days if you have windy days Danny de um they're always losing moisture out of those needles in out of those leaves and if you don't have moisture in the ground to replace that\nWhat happens it starts to dig within itself so you start losing moisture in those leaves and needles\nAnd now it's it's they dry out so they start to dry out so then they go to the branches and they start bring trying to pull moisture in from the branches to supplement what's been lost out of those leaves and needles um and then that's where you actually get into some branch damn winter damage because they start taking the moisture out of the branches as well\nBut it had they been really you know a well water going into the to winter season and good moisture in the ground or ... in the immediate root ball 'cause remember\nIt's just the immediate root ball and a few new roots are put out over the fall so it's still a pretty tight root system\nIf they don't have more should there to take back up what happens and they they can't replace that and you wind up having brown needles leaves a drop off in the springtime and branches that can die out as well that's why it's so important to make sure you hear me always kept talking about evergreens making sure those evergreens even established evergreens\nThat um if it's a dry fall you don't have good moisture in the ground even the established ones need to have that good more is you're going in the winter\nSo it's very very important and then and newly planted plants you've got to stick with it the good thing about the fall is the fact that temperatures are cooler\n[noise] we typically get more natural rain falls but temperatures are cooler so when you do go out and really soak those plants\nThey're not as active as they were during the season right so they don't take up quite as much and with a cooler temperatures it doesn't drive as fast so it lasts longer for you so you're not watering as often as you would during the summer\nBut it is important to keep good more she around those plants until we get close to the holiday season once you get there then you're back off\nI even suggest and Ron Ron with us are certified master certified or wrists uh same thing that if you plant a evergreens in the fall or late in the season um I Would even suggest\nOnce a month or in January and February if it stays really dry\nAnd there's no moisture in that ground to take a five gallon bucket\nAnd you get a day above freezing take that five gallon bucket go out there and dumped within the root ball around and ... to make sure again at those evergreens have good moisture going through January and February if you do a live Christmas tree and you get a plant that you know right after Christmas which is a great thing to do\nYou've got to make sure you water in well when you're planet and I'd be carrying that bucket of water out there once or twice in January and February to make sure it's got good moisture in the ruble\nReally really important so when you're putting your tools away at the end of the season\nYou know and I and I and I know a lot of folks are going to say well jeez I we've turned off our irrigation system already they've come winter rise to bono out what do we do because long falls in the same category you you go into the fall and winter with a dry lawn you come out next spring now looking so good\nSo you know if you turn the irrigation system off I understand that because you've got to protected against freezing\nBut you've got the last tool\nThat I put away the two last tools wanted to shovel cause I'm Still planting and to use the garden hose\n'cause I Want to be able to get out their water as needed right to the end of the year so those are the two last days you put away and by the way if you're going through freezing freezing nights warm days as we go to a new approach the holiday season\nMake sure you're taking out a hose off of the big take it off in the evening so it does a breeze and it put it back on his you needed to keep it off so your frost proof\nOr faucets are properly working\nTrust me been there done that\nTalk about it

I should remember first of all nobody ever heard of the Ryder Cup until the mid Nineteen eighties unless your golf historian\nAnd if that's the time you first caught onto it it was perfect because it was absolutely beginning its march to as exciting and event for team play in a sport that doesn't really have team play that you could possibly imagine and show\nYou know what happened was that American domination of the first fifty years started to get overturned in has been overturned since that time in Nineteen eighty five when Jack was team won for the first time after trying in eighty three\nAnd a ice it because it creates more interest in the game I said it gets the Americans fired up for the next time\nI'm ... it's more important to Europe it seems that it is to the United states I said so it's just a purpose confluence of factors for you or to win this thing every time\nSo when you hear somebody say the Europeans wanted more do do you do you think the euro's wanted more than we do\nKnow I don't it's just that when you know when you win something all of the time\nAnd you seem to be having a particular knack for doing so and you're really enthusiastic throughout the whole proceedings you know you you you would be lying if you did say afterwards this is really important to us that's why we got up that's why we\nTend to play better off than we might have on an average week yeah it really is important to watch the Americans you know you know for for ages and ages really until Tony jak when came along in Nineteen sixty seven in one ear and then when the open in sixty nine in the U.S open in Nineteen Seventy\n... there's been there's been an American game since Nineteen Thirteen when for instance we met when the U.S open a playoff so you know and and they will be little than they fell a ridiculed and they felt like second class citizens and even the players equipment was terrible the shoes were bad before Tony jak and signed on and the\nThe bag drop on the clothes are awful and show you show it's become important to them and they've proven to be good at it and when you're good at something it's important to you\nWe're talking with Peter Kessler here on the Augusta gulp show so have we lost perspectives on its importance or lack there I mean how important is it to the scheme of things ...\nWell not very edge I completely agree with Jack Nicklaus about what this says he calls this an international goodwill exhibition and it\nIs I mean you know one of the ... the original idea of it when Sam writer actually thought of it you know in Nineteen twenty six even though the first formal one was Nineteen twenty seven was\nHe wanted to popularize the game and just like you know the exhibitions in America that Harry Byrd and gave a Nineteen hundred were set up for the same purpose to send him across the country to again that had just been introduced to this one and let him demonstrate\nHow good it can be if you are proficient at it and how much fun it is to watch the ball in the air and imagine how much fun it is to try to make it go up into the air so\nYou know it's a it's a huge huge thing um in terms of its importance as a good we'll exhibition but it's not a golf tournament and you don't get a win and\nYou know in less it's somebody who's already a will go hall of famer this isn't going to put you over the top it's not going to put Westwood over the top but\nYou know it it it it's not going to it's not going to do that you have to have a savvy record in a foul do record and then the then the Ryder Cup is je ne also played super and the Ryder Cup\nBut it's the majors and it's the fifty wins in Europe that ... those are the important things is supposed to be fun and Europe kind of catch that more seemingly than we do which is hard to believe\nAre well that's exactly the opposite of what I was gonna ask having said what you said so you don't think that we the Americans\nHave a better grasp of what it all means because they seem to take it very seriously we seem to have issues with that it's as if you know they realize deep down it's done really mean anything so it doesn't really matter if we play well or not\nDo you think the Americans have a better grasp of what it all means\nNo I I I I think they act in some ways\nA little bit spoiled if you will you know when you go to the Ryder Cup is a player there's so much other stuff that goes on that you wouldn't have to deal with that the u._s. open and we'd go home and\nCook dinner and go to bed here you've got step every night and you're changing clothes and member tiger you know for the different days used to put on the wrong blue pants by accident he put on the stripe on the side of the checked with so much stuff so many interviews so many team meetings for an individual sport\nAnd you're not playing as a team it's not like you're lining up on one side of the football you're all over the place all over a golf course\nSome of the guys are sitting and watching on television so [noise] you know it's a completely different things so [noise]\nUh it it just seems to me that the Americans don't like the extra stuff they don't seem to have a particularly good attitude and we are way way over thinking the whole process about who you put with who I mean\nYou know they said the Joe McCarthy the matter to the Yankees you you know you're genius these damn a genius he's at first I write down Ruth and I write down Gary and then I say go play Goodfellas and then I'm a genius because they play good\nAnd uh you know so I don't think the Ryder Cup captain as very much to do with anything and nobody knows how anybody's going to play on at any given day including when you first walk on the tea nobody knows so that's why this business at projecting in predicting a so insane 'cause nobody knows anything there isn't any information\nBut I think the Americans don't don't seem to have a good attitude about it and I feel like they feel like they're put upon and I feel like they got micro managed here and I just think this is just lay off and that the guys decide who they want to play with ... for your appearance shouldn't have said six words all week\nWe're talking to Peter ... you're on the Augusta adult show do we just find it so incredibly hard to accept that the Europeans just play better Gulf than we do in in that situation you I used to make more pilots ... we just seem to find that so hard to accept\nYeah I uh I I think that what happened is that you know\nIt almost reminds me of what tiger wet through 'em until this year with major championships in the past several years when he's been able to play which was\nHe would come to the first team a major on the first day and he looked stressed out already and that's first swing was always going to be short and fashion and news going to block it to the right it was short and fashioning block it to the right and it it make bogey or like a ... year he'd make a seven on the first or and you never get to recover from it\nAnd I feel like that ...\nUm it resides within the American squad and has for quite some time since it became clear that Europe was in fact actually dominating the proceedings over a now you know three decade period of time\nAnd so you know I think that they they come there knowing they're supposed to win and now we're supposed to relax but they don't quite relaxed\nAnd you'd get micro managed and and and it's a different environment I just think that there's a stress factor from minute one because if you're expected because of on paper you are the better team to win you you you want to just be able to play your game\nBut the circumstances of the week and the pressure that builds up over losing the two years before even though in this case Americans one two years before but there have been so many European victories that the occasional you know oh wait and sixteen I think the last two you know of of the ... century that they that the u._s. just want to show\nYou know Europe she used to winning the U.S has used to losing and they're used to being the favorites\nAnd that's a lot of stress and you can't make golf happened and Europe as the underdog there's more relaxed they know they have a great record everybody seems to get along nicely just the right amount of fun and they know the Americans are going to be stressed out and they are and it starts\nInstantly even though the U.S jumped out to relieve the first morning people forget that after ... you know after the first you know twenty five percent of team play they were in the lead three to one and then of course the whole thing went south\nDo you think Peter\nThe Ryder Cup team would be better served if tiger and do a lesser extent bill went to the next captain and say you know what not us we've been more of a distraction then than a than a asset\nTake us out of the equation still kind of will be forty nine so he's probably out of the equation but do you think that would be something valuable for them to do\nReally depends on how they're playing you know\nThere's you know on an objective basis in my view they were reasonable picks for the change certainly tiger after finishing\nYou know show beautifully at the open championship and um and then of course you know coming in second it the PGA Championship and you know moving up for what a twelve hundred in the world the like twenty after I mean you know he can you know and he was competitive any moved up the Ryder Cup point you say he was an obvious take 'em\nFills a mixed bag because they say the players really love 'em and he's infectious and\nYou never know with Philly could have played graded the Ryder Cup because\n... career has been built on two or three good weeks a year that's why he's never wanted a season ending award not the money not the tournaments and not the stroke average not anything not ever in all since Nineteen Ninety One never a season ending award\nBecause his whole year is always two or three good weeks which is true of most players even some really terrific ones like ... who's an all time or but\nSo I you know I think that the decision this week on ... was poor and should have gone right to your point which is you know what I'm playing like a pig right now don't put me in alternative shots or let you know if I Want to go out\nUm as far as tigers concern you you got to put them out just won the tour championship one of the greediest performances we've seen in ages but yes if it came to the point where they were both playing iffy than they probably aren't going to get selected for the team in any way in the next go around at forty four and forty nine\nSo I don't think we'll have that issue again but this week Phil ... dropped in its it or don't don't don't don't put me out and author Josh and tiger should've said you know play me once a day and if they didn't say that then that was problematic but goes to your point of what they could have done but which probably won't come up again in the future\nI always appreciate the time Peter thanks for taking the time to do this\nGreat three with you my friend I Love the sound of your voice I really appreciate your friendship I Love the show people say the nicest things about you show I'm just always delighted to be in your company\nHas awfully nice of him to say
