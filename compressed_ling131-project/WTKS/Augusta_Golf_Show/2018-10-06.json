plus it's kind of fun to take a lot more and push it into a foot high pile leaves you know just ... it's just like they evaporate once you put a\nOnce you put a lot more ... more through um a couple of times it's amazing how\nHow's the weather like down with put them in the trash can All right take your your a string tremor but your safety glasses on your goggles on everything and then use that like a blender do that so I'm\nI've never done that before that's a good idea of being\nAble to them all up and then dumped them into the capitals have final as an adult on with the early ... exactly\nAnd people say trees are too dangerous they don't want big trees around the house well I mean yes trees can become dangerous over time but if you have a car\nAnd you're never maintain it it will become dangerous too so you know a tree has so many benefits associated with it\nTake care of it I mean habit inspected has the um have any potential problems identified and and so many things that were scared of with trees as risks can be mitigated\nWe treat her as regulators way of ways of printing trees reducing Fifteen Percent reduction in this in a can of being betrayed the size of the can be a trade selective pruning and we're making small printing cuts not ... because a lot of the problems\nBut just that selective reduction can yield a thirty to even fifty percent reduction in the when the forces of wind upon that tree plus it's centralized as the weight over the trunk\nAnd just makes a tree much less susceptible to wind damage um plus you know obviously removing the\nThe dead wood and things like that right so you know that's another thing that yes it it it scares people but it it can be managed and it doesn't have to be scary it's only scary if you ignore it\nAnd kind of pretend it isn't something that has to be\nTaken care of another objection to hear fairly calmly as tree roots you know get into the sewer lines or things at the\nEnd yes that can happen but there are there are chemicals you can find a a hardware stores are pointing supply stores that can kill roots that are going into into sewer lines sewer lines can be routed out by a plumber also there are a sewer lining I noticed a they had that runs sometimes on local radio\n... see a mind of acid wash them do it many times\nYou have um there's a gardener plumbing company in Cincinnati that does it as well right and I've talked to him extensively and you don't have to tear up your lens your landscaping or yard or anything they'll just line it from the inside of the house\nYou know I look at I look and run it two things one is the is the uh the pipe is one issue and then of course foundations cracking and in the ... the trees get blamed for those ... and if you think about it one is him if the tree was improperly placed in the situation we're going to talk about that in the next hour you know positioning the trees but secondly\nOne is when it comes to foundations typically the treaty and cause a problem though it may have taken moisture out of the soil\nAnd cause a sort of back off of the foundation which may cause it to crack which may have been caused water to run through the cracks and then\nThe roots may go after moisture that's what they do right with the treated and caused that and they get blamed for that all the time it really wasn't their fault secondly on the pipes if there is no leaky Jeanette quite so that there's no water coming another how does a treat others even water going through their right to ... got a cracker break or a leak\nObviously than any point whether it's a tree or whatever it may be it's going to go to more sure that's what a naturally does it searches more moisture survival so they get blamed for these problems when really\nIt was it they they did cause a ... you know bottom line was that got into the ... bottom line was they may have gotten into the cracks but they didn't cause something else cause a problem\nYeah and and even if you you run into that is a problem that can be addressed right you know I I'm Still waiting for somebody to show me the ... the route that that pushed in a ... a foundation wall ourselves in that\nI'm not saying it never happens and it's very rare yeah you know ... it gets blame you hear the blame a lot but it's it's very rare and when your way all these problems which are all manageable\nAgainst against all the benefits of trees\nA it it's it's it's a shame that we that we get rid of trees or we don't plant trees or we'll get scared of trees or when those problems are really manageable on their address civil\nUsa ... when ... was here I think the last time somebody emailed me later said one of the points that she made was outstanding we because we were talking about\nAll you know the CEO to and all that and what the trees do one thing was brought up of course was also helping to as far as the ... or natural habitats you know for for insects and and critters and all the ... and what they do for that alone you know what that is worse to our environment\nYou know being a house for all of those things\nYeah I have a colleague down in North Carolina is one of the leading a historic preservation is in the in the world really\nAnd he's a big ... big selling point of what he does and in tree preservation is the fact that you do have hollow areas and things like that and if the trees responding properly to a to a hollowed out area\nAnd has good worldwide formation the hollowed out area is a benefit for wildlife it's a home for a lot of types of wildlife and it it is not very often it's not something that's significantly compromising the truth I mean you get that do benefit their\nRight I saw a statement and I brought it here today I was looking for because I was going to ask you about that I thought it was a very interesting is trivia and facts about trees but it was a statement said trees don't die of old age\nYeah I've I've heard that and you can get into\nA long long um\nDiscussion on that because some trees like a lot of types of cherry trees and things they just get this cascading series of failures that causes you know causes a lot of them especially in an urban environment to to to die early just like with people I mean ... do people die of old age or do people start to get\nMore degenerative medical conditions as they get older\nI guess there is a genetic\nPotential for people as opposed to maybe there isn't for trees\nIt's a long discussion bottom line is if you have trees in your yard be thankful that you do keep them healthy um don't just go out there and cut them down get in Arbor certified are resorting to your house may become the doctor you treat become their patients keep them healthy they will come back to you

[noise]\nWell come back to the guts to do a show on John Patrick [noise]\nOn our website Augusta golf show dot\nCom we've got this morning's poll question up there for you so what do you think is it time for tiger and build a step aside from the Ryder Cup they weren't much help on the chorus last week they were old for the twenty Eighteen Ryder Cup\nIs it time for tiger and bill to step aside from the Ryder Cup log on to Augusta gulp show dot com let me know what you think well Peter Kessler is a Gulf historian you're familiar with his work from golf channel and the PGA Tour radio network\nI turned to beat her after every big gulp of bent the Ryder Cup qualifies as that it's a pleasure to welcome Peter Kessler back to the Augusta golf show I beat her\nI Love to hear the sound of your voice and I'm always delighted to hear their with it thank you how\nWell it's great to talk to you and I want to talk to you about the Ryder Cup and everything that took place last week let me start with this for your consideration the Ryder Cup is better every time the Europeans when\nOh absolutely it's you know it's funny I remember in two thousand and one right after nine eleven the Ryder Cup of course got cancelled so then it was moved even numbered years\nAnd it was going to be and it turned out to be the first year of the downhill links which is on this very weak\nAnd you play the ... of course when you play a car newsstand you play kings Barnes appear to one of the low twenty teams you get to go ahead\nAnd play on the Sunday and there's a hundred and sixty eight teams in one year I made with Thomas Levey he missed the cut but we made the cut and he was the only pro to play on Sunday I missed the cut individually and I made a twenty five thousand dollars\nAnd he wouldn't give me any money 'cause he ... he because he couldn't find anything that said I turned ...\nPro um but I was sitting with Johan Rupert Johan ... owns nights bridge was just down the hill and ... and all kinds of luxury brands and the two big gun hill championships the\nUh the ones in Great Britain and one in South Africa and we were sitting with a group or Europeans who it and just a you know in the last go around in Ninety nine at one the Ryder Cup\nAnd I was talking to him and I said it's always better when Europe wins because I said remember first of all nobody ever heard of the Ryder Cup until the mid Nineteen eighties unless you were a golf historian\nAnd if that's the time you first caught onto it it was perfect because it was absolutely beginning its march to as exciting and event for team play at a sport that doesn't really have team play that you could possibly imagine and so\nYou know what happened was that American domination of the first fifty years started to get overturned in has been overturned since that time in Nineteen eighty five when jak when his team won for the first time after coming in eighty three\nAnd a ice it because it creates more interest in the game I said it gets the Americans fired up for the next time I'm ... it's more important to Europe it seems that it is to the United states as it so it just a purpose confluence of factors for you or to win this thing every time\nSo when you hear somebody say the Europeans wanted more do do do you think the euro's wanted more than we do\nKnow I don't it's just that when you know when you win something all of the time and you seem to be having a particular knack for doing so and you are really enthusiastic throughout the whole proceedings\nYou know you you you would be lying if you did say afterwards this is really important to us that's why we got up that's why we\nTend to play better off than we might have on an average week yeah it really is important to watch the Americans you know you know for for ages in ages really until Tony jak when came along in Nineteen sixty seven in one ear and then when the open in sixty nine in the U.S open in Nineteen Seventy\nIt's been it's been an American game since Nineteen Thirteen when for instance we met when the U.S open in the playoffs so [noise] you know and and they will be little than they felt a ridiculed and they felt like second class citizens and even the players equipment was terrible the shoes were bad before Tony jak and signed on and the\nThe bag drop on the clothes are awful and so\nYes so it's become important to them and they've proven to be good at it and when you're good at something it's important to you\nWe're talking with Peter Kessler here on the Augusta dog show so have we lost perspectives on its importance or lack there I mean how important is it to the scheme of things ...\nWell not very it's I completely agree with Jack Nicklaus about what this says he calls this an international goodwill exhibition\nAnd it is I mean you know one of the ... the original idea of it when Sam writer actually thought of it you know in Nineteen twenty six even though the first formal one was Nineteen twenty seven was\nHe wanted to popularize the game and just like you know the exhibitions in America that Harry Barton gave a Nineteen hundred were set up for the same purpose to send him across the country to again that had just been introduced to this one and let him demonstrate\nHow good it can be if you are proficient at it and how much fun it is to watch the ball in the air and imagine how much fun it is to try to make it go up into the air so\nYou know it's a it's a huge huge thing um in terms of its importance as a good we'll exhibition but it's not a golf tournament and you don't get a win and\nYou know less it's somebody who's already a world of hall of famer this isn't going to put you over the top it's not going to put Westwood over the top but\nYou know it it it it's not going to it's not going to do that you have to have a savvy record in a foul do record and then the then the Ryder Cup is G and he also played super in the Ryder Cup\nBut it's the majors and it's the fifty wins in Europe that ... those are the important things is supposed to be fun and Europe kind of gets that more seemingly than we do which is hard to believe\nAre well that's exactly the opposite of what I was gonna ask having said what you said so you don't think that we the Americans\nHave a better grasp of what it all means because they seem to take it very seriously we seem to have issues with that it's as if you know they rely deep down inside you've done really mean anything so it doesn't really matter if we play well or not\nDo you think the Americans have a better grasp of what it all means\nNo I\nI I think they act in some ways\nA little bit spoiled if you will you know when you go to the Ryder Cup is a player there's so much other stuff that goes on that you wouldn't have to deal with that the u._s. open and we'd go home and\nCook dinner and go to bed here you've got step every night and you're changing clothes member tiger you know for the different days used to put on the wrong blue pants by accident he put on the stripe wanted to set of the ... so much stuff so many interviews so many team meetings for an individual sport\nAnd you're not playing as a team it's not like you're lining up on one side of the football you're all over the place all over a golf course\nSome of the guys are sitting you know and watching on television so [noise] you know it's a completely different things so [noise]\nUh it it just seems to me that the Americans don't like the extra stuff they don't seem to have a particularly good attitude and we are way way over thinking the whole process about who you put with who I mean\nYou know they said Joe McCarthy the matter to the Yankees you you know you're genius nice camera geniuses at birth or write down Ruth and I write down Gary and then I say go play Goodfellas and then I'm a genius because they play good\nAnd uh you know so I don't think the Ryder Cup captain as very much to do with anything and nobody knows how anybody's going to play on at any given day including when you first walk on the tea nobody knows you that's why this business of projecting and predicting so insane 'cause nobody knows anything there isn't any information\nBut I think the Americans don't don't seem to have a good attitude about it and I feel like they feel like they're put upon and I feel like they got micro managed here and I just think this is just laid off and that the guys decided who they want to play with ... for your appearance shouldn't have said six words all week\nYeah I uh I I think that what happened is that\nKnow it almost reminds me of what tiger wet through 'em until this year with major championships in the past several years when he's been able to play which was he\nWould come to the first team a major on the first day and he looked stressed out already and that's first wing was always going to be short and fashion news going to block it to the right it was short and fashioning block it to the right did it make bogey or like a ... this year he'd make a seven on the first or and you never get to recover from it and\nI feel like that ...\nUm it resides within the American squad and has for quite some time since it became clear that Europe was in fact actually dominating the proceedings over a now you know three decade period of time and so you know I think that they they come there\nKnow when we're supposed to win and now we're supposed to relax but they don't quite relaxed\nAnd you'd get micro managed and and and it's a different environment I just think there's a stress factor from minute one because if you're expected because of on paper you are the better team to win you you you want to just be able to play your game\nBut the circumstances of the week and the pressure builds up over losing the two years before even though in this case Americans one two years before but\nThere have been show many European victories that the occasional you know oh wait sixteen I think of the last two you know of of the ... century that they that the u._s. just want to show you know Europe she used to winning the U.S has used to losing and they're used to being the favorites and that's a lot of stress and you can't make golf happen\nAnd Europe as the underdog there's more relaxed they know they have a great record everybody seems to get along nicely just the right amount of fun\nAnd they know the Americans are going to be stressed out and they are and it starts almost instantly even though the U.S jumped out to relieve that first morning people forget that after you know after the first you know twenty five percent of the team play they weren't all eat three to one and\nThen of course the whole thing went south\nDo you think Peter\nThe Ryder Cup team would be better served if tiger and to a lesser extent Phil went to the next captain and say you know what not us we've been more of a distraction\nThan than a than a asset take us out of the equation still kind of ... will be forty nine so he's probably out of the equation but do you think that would be something valuable for them to do\nReally depends on how they're playing you know because\nYou know on an objective basis in my view they were reasonable picks for the change certainly tiger after finishing you know so beautifully at the open championship and uh and then of course you know coming in second at the PGA Championship and\nYou know moving up for what a twelve hundred in the world the light twentieth I mean you know he and you know and he was competitive any and moved up the Ryder Cup point you say he was an obvious take 'em\nFills a mixed bag because they say the players really love 'em and he's infectious and\nYou'd never know with Philly could've played graded the Ryder Cup because\nFills whole career has been built on two or three good weeks a year that's why he's never wanted a season ending award not the money not the tournaments not the stroke average not anything I'd ever in all since Nineteen Ninety One never a season ending award\nBecause his whole year is always two or three good weeks which is true of most players even really terrific ones like ... who's an all time or but\nSo I you know I think that the decision this week on film was poor and should have gone right to your point which is you know what I'm playing like a pig right now don't put me in alternative shop to let you know if I Want to go out\nUm as far as ... concerned you you got to put them out just won the tour championship one of the greatest performance as we've seen in ages but yes if it came to the point where they were both playing iffy than they probably aren't going to get selected for the team in\nAny way in the next go around at forty four and forty nine so I don't think we'll have that\nIssue again but this week Phil ... dropped and it said uh don't don't don't do puppy out and altered shots and tiger's should have said you know play me once a day and if they didn't say that then that was problematic but goes to your point of what they could have done but which probably won't come up again in the future\nI always appreciate the time Peter thanks for taking the time to do this\nGreat three with you my friend I Love the sound of your voice I really appreciate your friendship I Love the show people say the nicest things about you show I'm
