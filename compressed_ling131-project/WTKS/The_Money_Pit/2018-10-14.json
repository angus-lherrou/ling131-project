{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "So when we have stress whether it's physical stress chemicals stress mental stress emotional stress emotional stress the emotional holding that would be an emotional stress right yeah so when you have those things what happens is is the bones within your spine go out of their normal position or their normal alignment\nThat'll end up putting pressure on the nurse that let's say go to your lungs and if the nerves that control your lungs are being interfered with what will happen in the functioning of your lungs were will decline so as a chiropractor when we do a spinal adjustment\nTo the areas that control and regulate respiratory and lung function what should happen with that\nAnd it should help restore the that pathway so that the lungs can begin to function\nExactly so what chiropractic does and it's very very effective at for people who have a breathing issues as it takes the pressure off the nerves that control the breathing process it helps to free up\nThe restrictions within that area and allow for more fluid more natural more flowing and ease of breathing every time you get a chiropractic adjustment\nSo would the the area that would be affected be the same for every person in terms of where on your spine the breathing is located\nWhile there's general uh relationships that I could say yes that when a person has respiratory issues I'm going to look at the area between their shoulder blades all the way down to the base of their a rib cage [noise] um but I could also look above that you know the sea five primarily the sci fi vertebrae in your neck\nSee three see foresee five those three nurses come together to form what's called a diaphragm nerve or the frantic narrow\nAnd er there's interference in your neck impinging upon that nerves than the diaphragm want move properly so when a person comes in with a high it'll hernia that's restricting their breathing because their stomach has pushed up through the diaphragm not allowing the dire for him to move appropriately\nLearn things were going to do is pull the stomach down out of a diaphragm so that that you can go back to working together instead of fighting with each other\nAnd one of the things that will do as a result of that is will adjust between their shoulder blades and they'll also adjust the see three see for sci fi vertebrae to make sure that the front of their that controls the diaphragm is doing his job\nNow because we've talked a lot about how emotions affect your breathing are there things that get out of alignment just because of your emotions\nSo absolutely your emotions\nAffect how your organs England's function\nSo when you have an emotion that you can of ... a process sufficiently like grief\nOkay that's going to restrict the Oregon and the Oregon actually regulates how those nerves function\nLike we're just talking about between the shoulder blades and and uh you know up at the junction between how your neck attaches to your uh middle part of your back or your ... spine\nSo when a person has these kinds of of imbalances within their organs they're going to set the body up for the need for chiropractic adjustments and sometimes our physical stresses and the way we go out and and do things you know if you're a pitcher and you're always using one arm you're going to\nStrain the one side of the body versus the other side if you're a football player and you're a you know blocking are being tackled are these kinds of things you're going to set yourself up for that basketball you know hockey all the sports that involve any kind of physical contact in and body checking in those kinds of things\nUm those are going to create the basis for spinal miss alignment and\nFortunately or unfortunately we have a thing in this world called gravity which keeps us attached to the planet but the effects of gravity on the body\nIf you don't maintain the integrity of your body is also going to create one of them is alive and so those are all really good reasons for why you would want to go see a chiropractor and uh certainly go see a chiropractor\nTo maintain your integrity up your spine and uh the pending upon the level of abuse that you give to your spine your your maintenance schedule may be different from somebody who doesn't abuse their spine\nNow you mentioned a grief a moment ago and I know that this time of the year relates to a grief and and the grieving process when we we feel losses that seems to be one of the emotions it's most tied into breathing in terms of breathing problems well\nIt is because grief is the chief pathological emotion that affects how the lung function really yeah okay and and we we've all seen it we've seen it depicted in movies we've seen it if we've ever gone to a funeral we've seen it within ourselves if we've ever had some level of loss\nAnd when we start to grieve over that Los ... us very very hard to breathe\nAnd uh if if you're at the point of tears and and the grief is is just so overwhelming it makes it hard for people to to uh take more Erin why because they just keep breathing and it's like okay you have to breathe out to let go of that\nAt the expanding your diaphragm that's allowing the ... the release of the energy before you fill it back up again and and the breathing the breathing is the key to life which is why ah acupuncture Meridian uh for the lungs as associated with the lung one point\nUm which is where the energy actually enters the body for the twenty four hour circadian rhythm cycle that the body has it enters into exactly three o'clock in the morning through the lungs one point which is located in the uh little Hallows between your shoulders and and your classical in your rib cage there\nSo I mean in order to be able to process degrees which is if you are finding yourself in a situation where grief is the emotion that you are experiencing you want to be able to process that through which would mean that being able to work on breathing\nExercises are breathing different kinds of ways of breathing might be a very helpful thing to do during the rocks outta\nRobustly go take a yoga class and do lung poses uh-huh be interesting when you're doing a lung pose if you have grease that that grief comes to the surface why 'cause you're stimulating the lung Meridian by doing a lung pose when you're doing yoga or if you happen to be doing that kind of yoga um\nBut going out and exercising enforcing yourself to breathe heavy heavy is is always the best way to help recycle the energy within the body is through doing exercise\n[laughter] well that is really you know this is a very helpful show because breathing is so central to our life it is to sort of the core first and most important thing that we do correct 'em\nKnow that for a lot of people I'm sure that are out there listening to the show maybe having issues with their breathing or maybe having issues with some

their heating and cooling system can maintain comfort all throughout the year but what do you do in one room to have one room to cold just start doing science experiments and injecting ...\nThat's right and in order to compensate for those uneven temperatures many homeowners often open enclosed Vance they wear layers of they set up with a thermostat throughout the entire day which of course does nothing to solve the problem and definitely drives your energy costs up there are better solutions\nFor advice on how to do just that we turn now to Richard ... he's the heating and plenty expert for TV's this old house welcome Richard and gosh knows and all that bouncing of the thermostat up and down all day that's got to add to a lot of waste energy right\nRight I mean hot and cold spots throughout the home or not only annoying they're also inefficient it usually comes down to poor duct work you know we'd love to make the assumption that the first person that did the engineering to do the heating system in this building\nCalculated exactly how many ... calculated exactly what size addicts would be calculate exactly the right amount of air coming out and then put the ... everything incorrectly who is not always the case just\nDoesn't happen in so we end up with areas in our house that are too hot to cold I mean I've got a an addition I have an old house Eighteen eighty six\nThe kitchen is an addition that was sort of bolted on after the initial construction so now you have an addition that has more sides that are exposed to the weather that room or was always hotter in the summer was always cold in the winter and we had to add to it and we had that air conditioning compensate because\nBasically it was calling for more beat to use them we were delivering his right\nAnd that's the condition that that is really faced by many people across the country and in problem areas like for example rooms above garage ... rooms or at the end of the building as far away from the HVAC system so if the guy that put it in initially got it wrong or if there were just changes the building over the years what are some of the ways that you can attack that\nWell I think zoning is underutilized in this country there are mechanical zoning dampers that can be added to hotter system\nThat can like in the case of your kitchen how I Would imagine that that's probably the farthest room away from the furnace okay well air or water wants to take the path of least resistance who doesn't want to fight its way through a long dark\nIt'll say I'm just going to go right here and I'm going to go right up through this duck to the upstairs second floor and overheat the second floor was only we can say no let's shut off the air that would have or might have gone to the second floor and drive it to the farthest hardest to heat place and that would be your kitchen\nSo a separate zone is literally a separate set of ducks separate supplies\nSame docks all we're doing is putting in a motorized dampers in strategic places in line okay the ... system and that really is that technology is out there that technology is not perfected\nSo many of the heating industry just says oh I don't want to do that I'm not sure I Know how to do that and so they're down on what they're not up on but zoning is a very important sort of thing to be able to deliver comfort and to save energy\nMany times we have a furnace that is heating up a very big part of the building but we really needed the kitchen or the the ...\nSo unlike hot water zoning were really do have separate sets of pipes with zoning and hot air we really uses one set of ducks but we just control and balanced the flow that's where I put it where we need it when we need\nThat's right and what we need to do is to be able to match the furnaces size or power if you've only got one register open you don't want that full size furnace on so some of these modern for instance can now talk in concert with the zoning system\nWe're talking to Richard ... he's the heating and plenty expert for TV's this old house now a sudden the duck system thermostat location can sometimes be problematic if it's not the right position you could get false readings and false communications to the heating and cooling\nAnd everything we've seen\nThermostats behind the television and the TV's given another big flat screen is given us so much that he right we've seen people that put a woodstove and right next to the farmers to satisfy the farmer sets of the rest of the house doesn't have any heat we're seeing everything it really needs to be in a representative location or to be able to sample but the buildings looking for\nNow aside from laying out the ducks and proper we're putting the thermostat in the wrong place sometimes the initial counter to discuss the ducks size incorrect or the size of the ACC system incorrect cry over\nSeizing mechanical equipment is the number one energy waste her in the home heating system everybody\nIf they were does if the HBO she industry was designing a car they put a V. twelve engine into the equivalent of folks want to be safe they won't have plenty of power but it actually leads you works completely against you because if you've got too big of a furnace or a boy when\nIt comes on shuts off comes on and shuts off it gives you too much heat and then it doesn't give you enough and so it cycles not tried doing that to any device do it to an automobile turn it on and off every minute\nYou wouldn't be efficient it wouldn't it wouldn't last and that's what we're doing so
