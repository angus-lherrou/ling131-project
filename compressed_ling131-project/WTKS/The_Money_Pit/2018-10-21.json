{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Helping a person who addressed the underlying health issues what kind of solutions can you offer and how do those solutions work to change the conditions while\nIt honestly dependent upon the condition\nAnd mark but my initial response as as I offer all solutions\nAll solutions to all the different health problems because we boil it back and we break it back down to and we get to the source of the problem when you address the source the effects goes away on its own you get a cut and that ... will heal on its own overtime\nYou may intervene you may just simply allow it to do its own job okay but the point is is your body is a self healing mechanism and it is going to heal unless it can't and when it can't you need to understand why it's not doing the job that it was designed to do that God imbued with and then address that\nThat's a very important concept that I I don't know that we've talked about quite that way before and I think I'd like to just do a little bit into that the idea that\nYou know you you're dealing with a health issue and you have a new ways of addressing that are facing it altogether I mean you're talking about something that's just a completely different approach\nWell it is a completely different approach from ... Madison absolutely but guess what mark what I Do isn't new\nFor me you're dealing with a largely with nutrition with breathing with water these very elemental things that we all do every day for how long forever\nWe spend doing it forever forever okay I I I say this tongue in cheek and it's not my intention to offend anybody regardless of their religious a perspective but Jesus was a chiropractor\nAnd I say that tongue in cheek but Jesus was a hands on healer Jesus also was a face healer\nBut Jesus basically created the change by enlightening people as to what the truth is and the truth is is you don't get better health for better chemistry you don't get better health by putting toxic chemicals into your body and expecting a better result as a result\nYou can block physiology you can push and pull physiology which is what medicine does but you're not actually creating balance and harmony you're not actually addressing the cause of the imbalance to begin with\nOkay and so what people need to do is they need to get more empowered they get to need to get more understanding as to why the body does what it does and when you address it what I Do is it knew what I Do is thousands of years old\nOkay it's just that we've lost sight of it because of the medical monopoly has become so big that people stop thinking about what is what I just need to go to the doctor they are going to write me a little sheet of paper with a name on it that I Can't even read and I don't even know how the pharmacist read it\nBut they're going to give me this this chemical pill that is a only available by prescription and this comes in a child proof safe container and uh it doesn't matter that my teenagers are breaking into it and stealing my pills and going and having farm parties and all of those fun things it doesn't matter that these drugs aren't\nProperly regulated in and made sure that if they don't fall in the wrong hands doesn't any of those things don't matter it matters to how much of this can we get out into the public and how much profit can we make in the process\nBut I mean Europe process is really one where you are taking away the things that make your body not function as opposed to putting something into the body that can continues that line of not functioning but didn't treats the right all masks at that masks and\nThere are things that I asked my patience to do which puts things in their body that actually makes their body function and get better it's called ... supplements Saturday called whole foods supplements and when you give the by the ingredients that are missing\nThen the body goes back to doing what it's supposed to do think of think of your health as a pot holds Laden road you got a bunch of potholes now medicine's going to come have the street but they're never going to fill in the tunnel\nSo what's going to happen over time as you drive over that street ... going to come back and a lot of music municipalities that's how they repair their ... they just simply cover my cover them up they don't actually affects the reason for it and okay and so what my job is just to fill in the potholes\nAnd then have over it and that's what giving\nPerson proper ingredients proper nutrition is okay going back to the garden of Eden and taking the ingredients that were there originally for human beings and giving them though those ingredients that are necessary okay and taking and nothing else\nMan and I just love this idea that what you're permitting is for the body to do it naturally does which is to come back into homeostasis to come back to health\nYeah because that's what our natural state is supposed to be in in the stresses that we have in the ways that we are stimulate our body and erroneous fashion is what leads to the health problems that we have\nAnd when we've done it so often for so long then it changes the the physics and changed the physical aspects and it changes the the physiology of it and once that happens okay then you have to go\nReverse that process or change it in such a way that it can go back into balance as opposed to removing Oregon's removing other parts replacing parts because you've neglected them so much and uh now you need lifetime medication\nBut are there but in either case whether you come in and visit you and see you have some kind of health condition or disease or you come in and you have a fairly good health and you want to prevent yourself from ever getting ... disease to solutions really come down to kind of the same\nGeneral idea which is you remove anything that's blocking the body from being healthy\nGiven whatever needs from a nutritional standpoint to bring it back to help and then allowing the body to take\nCare a lot of vitamin D to do its job on its own ... your body is\nA self healing mechanism mark you're aware of that I'm aware of that everybody listening is aware of that because everybody's had to cut he'll on its own\nSo why is your body not doing the big ticket items like a heart disease like diabetes like a cancer like a high blood pressure because it's not being addressed appropriately and medicine is not addressing inappropriately otherwise we wouldn't continue to have these conditions and they wouldn't be getting worse but they are getting worse and the treatments are getting more exotic\nBut the exotic treatments aren't a solution so we need to change our focus we need to change our perspective we need to change where we're starting as far as our health goes and we need to make health a priority not screenings not quote passive preventative lifetime medications\nOkay we need to get back to what God's intention is for us\nIt's it sounds simple it sounds logical it makes common sense to hear you say that and at the same time if somebody is looking to become more educated about what the process these are if somebody's looking to deal with a health issue and\nYou know most people out there don't have the level of knowledge and sophistication of their of the information that you have better looking for the solution and want to become more proactive about their health what is the best way to get in touch with you and may avail themselves of the services you offer\nThe best way is to call my cell phone and area code aid for five five six one to two to five\nA gallon eight four or five five six one to two to five\nOr email me directly a dock Rick at ... dot com that's D. O. C. R. I. C. K. at spine boy dot com come to a free healthcare class come to the office just get a hold of me\nAsk you questions get your questions answered if there's something I can do for you I Will definitely offer it to you if there's something I Can't do but somebody else can I Would refer to them\nAt the end of the day don't suffer don't continue to suffer don't get on that treadmill of treatment do something to get off of it do something to get your body back to balance and back to wellness\nIf you need help when you're ready please let me know because I'm happy to do that for you I Want to thank you for tuning in I appreciate your listenership mark thanks for putting the show together I Want you to tune back in next week same health time same station this is Dr Richard on June from advance alternative medicine center saying I'll look forward to supporting you\nOut as they become a pain in the ...\nWhat was the thing I was\nOiled or exercise I was ...\nYears on my side of the hour\nItems on the Internet shut down the medical try to get you may not be the rest of them then again you might want to and then you\nLaw you need you know out one day\n\nSuch an email on a project like this is critical there's really nothing that that doesn't have a lot of attention paid to it and wouldn't talk about that heating and cooling so you're telling me earlier that this is such a sophisticated system you could actually heat and cool at the same time I get the perfect temperature and\nHow do I do all your listeners know that you know the the world's going crazy with these really superficial heat pumps you know you you know the names Mitsubishi algae hit touchy send you open a sonic\nAnd they are reached the point now that they are they're so efficient as it gets you enough heat even zero degrees outside the heat of building in a zero degree New England when winter\nBut you always had to either decide that you were going to be in Haiti mode\nOr ... the whole system had to be the heating and cooling right well this what we introduced here for the first time in a residential application we've been able to do it and commercial before is a thing called ... recovery and he recovery is different it has a BIG Magic box outside\nAnd it has three refrigerant lines that go inside to the building to these distribution boxes and then once we're inside we can have up to twelve different air handlers or different delivery methods to the building but the key\nIs that we can simultaneously heat and cool a building for the first time ever well that's the first time ever in residential ... it was always in commercial you could always right so now that means the son could be coming in the south side of a fall day and you need to cool that top floor Sunnyside bedroom\nWell when you do that you're going to gather some of that son's he's\nInto the refrigerant and then normal you just should send that down to outside it to be wasted on what we can do here is we can say no we can we we can use this energy to good effect and we can hate the north side rooms well the final piece of this that makes this thing such a breakthrough in my opinion\nIs we get one additional heat exchange off of this system right\nAnd that heat exchange has refrigerant into it and we can use that waste heat that heat that we would've dumped outside to also heat the water for faucets [laughter] so this is now while all in on whatever these Trump ... has dropped about this for a long time so we're we're incredibly excited we we love being on the front end\nYou got to be able to watch this project yeah wow yeah see I don't see how it also rules out um before I let you go and ask you one more thing now obviously this building has to be very tight and you use that technique here I think it's called aerospace yelling at us for infiltration that sounds really fascinating about that Dr ...\nSo ... was the stuff that I think ... the ah ah duct worked right same company came out with the next generation of single arrow barrier and this is a way\nThat I'm In a house on the construction or an existing house has incredible infiltration\nTen seal itself up to a level that you could you could never done before [noise] so what they do is they put the building onto her little negative pressure they push her out of it well yes so they're pulling putting fans to push push air out to the building against the ... the walls are and then they put these little\nAdam ... stations all around and what happens is that this find missed that is in the air\nIf it finds a crack anywhere at the pointed goes near the crack\nThe velocity increases when that ... those aerosol buried here so ... beads right go through ... and we'll seal is like an event or a oh armory it's unbelievable and so\nWe saw this thing that this was already a tight building relatively tight but we saw this thing go down I think by um eighty percent less so uh [noise] and what what I like is that\nThere are houses that were done on low bid there were how's the ... of their houses that you are would be desperate and with this you can actually do it in a retrofit you'd have to\nYou'd have to cover horizontal surfaces you know because you know your couches and the floors with plastic but you could literally retrofit a house and they have this computer gauge that you watch it shows you what the infiltration is you know\nThree hundred see fmri who say you got to watch it just literally watching seal write up for your eyes crazy fantasy I think that's going to be a major breakthrough for for building the building trades\nWell great work as usual really exciting jak thanks so much for being a part of the money that and thanks I mean at your graduation on the forty that version of

excited today and proud of seeing this complete it's kind of like ah maybe watching when your babies all grown up and and\nGetting married yeah you know as a as an architect we've I've done a lot of buildings over twenty five years into the some of that magic has worn off in my normal practice but this was kind of returning to why I wanted to be an architect to begin with and have this much control over it with the with the team that all cared about\nThe detail as much as I did write it's been really renewing experience yeah and\nLet's talk about this area this is an area that had a lot of summer homes now what was the condition of the building like\nWhen you go first on it it was a year round residents\nAnd it was really tired yeah it was just not in great shape nothing had been done to it and many many years and it was kind of awkwardly carved out right and it's dark and\nYou know they say people say well it just don't build 'em like they used to have you back like this thing you could put your shoulder until the corner and the whole house with shutter\nNow is an architect I Would imagine it's probably easier to build a net zero hold from scratch what was it like to start with a hundred year old home and have to convert it to become and that's\nYour home it's possible to do either but when you're combining systems in trying to get the whole thing to work together as one unit it's a series of different techniques in different parts of the house\nFor the um the old part of the house we had to pack off the walls to make them deeper for more insulation\nAnd straighten out the framing and an ad inflation on next year right for the new part of the house we could start from scratch and and very all that information into clean to buy six war all with inflation and the outside so\nThat in general or just a lot of techniques that you have to marry the measure the effects of all those if you're really gonna engineer the house to be net zero right\nOut of it is the mathematical calculation which I didn't do a heck of a help to figure out how much energy to consume and how much it needs to have you done that zero projects in your practice before yeah my from as I'm\nSort of has a minor specialty and sustainable neighborhoods all his great we have several going up right now where we're building new construction for net zero but this was the first home that we had mixed techniques\nTogether yeah yeah now I Know you guys work on some projects um didn't want to ask you about the challenges that you had finding efficient lighting everything about this house is based on a fish and sea reasonable to combine style decor was finding efficiency and way\nI feel like we had great selection Institute found that I think that takes effect on a really long way though I didn't feel any challenges around the findings\nAnd the trade offs not you know almost all of the good companies are now offering their their model in LAPD format which is obviously much more efficient form out from the old incandescent bulb race so everything in the houses are lady of one form or another or otherwise highly efficient\nEnergy Star rated the also worked on the kitchen design which is you know more than just funny beautiful country and there's a there's a lot of design that goes into the last of the kitchen and how to join with the other rooms and how to join with the outside of ... was that process like pointing out together\nI think that what was really helpful if the you know experiences that other projects that leads on together and that we've lived in and taking the pieces as projects that we really loved and wanted to recreate in this house how I feel like\nIt was pretty easy to arrive at the layout that we have now and I'm just I'm thrilled I think that's great\nThat's fantastic it's such a beautiful space and don't interest that you enjoy woodworking and and you were able to build a city council from reclaimed lumber for those that are unfamiliar with that term what does that mean these were open door jams from a bar and that\nWas built a hundred and fifty years ago and I found those in the shop in Cambridge and took goes down to just shopping with Tommy solo we milk them clean and straight and crew and joined them together and then cut the console out of the\nWealth congratulations it's an amazing projects
