{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "For hours and hours of every day and the communication that goes back and forth so what do you think about the best way to manage that process of of\nYou know this is the world that they live in so they this is the world they have to deal with but you know how do you temper that with you know in an appropriate way to use other activities in your life\nUm I Would make sure that they have an abundance of activities to do that a well rounded um I have some patients who are parents and I learned a lot from them in terms of how they choose to deal with it and I was going to ask you how you would choose to deal with it but I think that we should have time limits\nOkay I also think that we need to a serious they take a look at how early we introduced technology to our kids as far as cell phones and that kinda stuff goes and an email addresses and tax thing and that kind of stuff because I I mean at the end of the day I I don't know that the kids that are in elementary school need to have a phone\nI don't know that the kids in elementary schools should be tax thing I don't know that the kids had some of the kids that are in a what's known as middle school or junior high or needs to have any of that I don't know that any of these kids even all the way up through high school should be allowed to bring cell phones in the school\nBut guess what I don't have kids so I'm not working in that arena all day every day and I know that I got through school without any of those devices and so I don't know that those devices are absolutely necessary but\nMaybe I'm the one who's out of touch as far as how that goes along in school but yeah you know you you see so many stories about kids taking things out of context and you see on the TV shows at night that they have to do with law and order and those kinds of things to where you know kids get caught up into\nA not interpreting things right because somebody\nUh sent me an emoji or somebody ... you know sex to be a message of some sort that was inappropriate and with kids don't have the understanding of what the consequences are using some of the technology the way that they are and how the permanent sea of what that is on the Internet and you know\nYou can do a search result Twenty years after an incident happened and you can see all the information about it and it's like okay well if you did something wrong because you didn't have the understanding that that potentially is going to follow you for the rest of your life so I think that\nI don't have the the specific right answer but I think as a parent that you need to\nSet the rules and set the tone in and set the restrictions and you know I have a patient friends and and and other acquaintances that they put time limits they actually have a timer on their device that won the timer goes off\nThe device turns off and you can't turn it on again now\nWith kids the way they process information in technology and all that they may find a worker is going to be able to turn the thing about it on again without you think that they've turned the device off and they are they able to find a workaround\nThe vice back on again and it's like you know\nWell you know what other things that said that it really does involve parental\nParticipation in what's going on our vision and supervision I mean they're certainly there are things that are because I Know that my kids use these devices and but I also know that one of the major text groups there's little text group which is just the immediate family the immediate family and grandparents and people like that and aunts\nAnd so it's a very fun thing for everybody to participate in because you know people are living in very different parts of the world and they can to check in what's happening what do you do today what did you do today and show a funny video of you know what the dog is doing or where what the weather looks like in Montana or something of that nature\nAnd so that's uh that's one to really cultivate where the participation is being supported by a group of loving people and it gives a way to do that activity because the desire is to do the activity as with other kids are doing or they're doing with people who you know to be safe\nWho you know to be have the best interests of the children at heart right and that's really different than some of the other things that are going on where you see this unsupervised thing and I I you know I worked with our local district attorney\nAbout bullying and cyber bullying and seeing the impact that that's having on people's lives and what was what was very striking to me when we had some of the sessions with him was that\nThe the kids who were being facing court time you know ... family court time for bullying and things like that were kids who win the intervention came and they started to deal with the parents the parents were bowling the children there were ... that we're building these other\nKid right you mimic the behavior that you're you find yourself and\nExactly so you know the as I say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and in that situation we were looking at it and the way that this the the way the education has to happen and has to happen from the parents down to the children correct they can't just happened that you can expect the children to take control of it\nWell it's funny because when I get parents that come into my office with a kid that's a little unruly or has attention deficit or something along those lines as behavioral issues and they they come in and and they say I Need you to help my child and I looked at them in the eye and I say good I Need you to sit down and they're like but\nThe problems with my child I said I understand that we're going to fix that but I Need you to sit down because I Need to address you because you're the source of their problem whether you were an active\nParent or a passive parent or a mail it in parents or whatever whatever example that you set ... is what fostered the child to have the behavioral issues that they have\nAnd if we're going to address it than we need to address the modeling that they're they're they're matching and get to the source of where the modeling is coming from yeah and it's\nNinety nine times out of a hundred it's going to start with a parent\nWell that's the thing and and I know you do a lot of work with kids and whenever you're working with children in the ... and the way that you approach out because you deal with health and the seven different pillars that we've talked about before\nA in particular and the emotional mental spiritual components of health\nDid you have to be able to deal with the parents as well as in show that you can't just address just the children and um\nSo if there is there are parents out there who are listening to the show and are interested in intrigued by what we're talking about and would like to reach out to you and they have a child that they like to see about getting some kind of health intervention or health care or just to be able to talk to you about or just a foster better health to foster better health what's the best way to reach out to you\nThe best way is always to call my cell phone directly because that's the line that I'm going to answer regardless of where I Am in the world you know I go up to New York once a week every month and uh I get my patients in in pool is it called me up in New York and they're just appreciative of the fact that I answered the phone and and can address their their concern\nAnd sell the best way to get a hold of me as to call my cell phone at area code eight four or five\nFive six one to two to five again eight four or five five

I'm rich Dennison Fox News the centered on Saturday confirming Brett Kavanaugh to a seat on the Supreme Court followed by a swearing in Republicans and Democrats still reeling from the long process just\nNow ... yeah I've got to get work we had a lot of treats there have to clean it up quickly but at least I'm not already I ... not hit that are going to the ground and wait and see it when there's a little ... one of them it just kept with certainly okay\nYeah so that's going to be a problem because your neighbors gonna dump a lot of water your weight can chat with your neighbor about fiction is or\nDiverting I don't ... I don't like that that wasn't the grounds\nWell what'd you do is you you basically it's kind of like wrote a router you\nHire a drink and and essentially what has to happen here you got 'em and just war anyway you can so I Would tell you\nYes that was that oversized gutters on both houses so instead of uh foreigners gutter I Would put a six inch because they caught a lot less frequently I Would try to have the downs Baptist church and the lowest part of the property and I would extend the down south to the war does not collect around the foundation either over greater or underground you extend them and get them out\nIf I was still collecting water in the space between the two homes would I Would do is put in French grain\nAnd basically that's a trench that's um you know roughly twelve to Eighteen Inches square and then you put some a stone in the bottom of it you lay up her for a pipe and stone and then you put more dirt and stone around it and essentially what happens is is the water collection that area goes into the pipe\nAnd it runs out there's a type of French train that's actually pre made these days where you don't have to be no stone thing\nUm and then you'll find that home centers where it's it looks like a plastic parade pipe wrapped in a cloth that has what looks like packing peanuts in between the coughing\nAnd the and the pipe itself and that sort of the aggregate not condoning one piece\nBut however you do that you got to put the drain is kind of pitch so at least about a quarter of your foot in the war has collected America go somewhere and that's the key you got to find out where that somewhere is you know if it's the backyard great if it's the front yard you might be able to\nTo drop it into the street if his how much you do that but you got to manage that water if you don't manage the water is going to have no place to go but down saturate those foundation walls and will show up as a leak\nIn both basements potentially\nBut you can fix this you know if you manage the water if you search on our website how if you search on our website money dot com um about leaky basements you'll you'll find as you look at how to solve the basement

through this step by step and show you all the ways that are that this causes the floods OK\nOkay and let's go to that and the thing that you have like the ...\nOh that's plenty of room for it with

the same so we can\nGet rid of the Iraq at the U.S looks like it was fun to go to just get that only I can see the water in the basement\nAnd what kind of foundation is poured concrete concrete block when I checked concrete for concrete okay citizenship correction not unusual in New foundations\nThere's a lot of settlement that goes on in the first few years of of a home\nAnd very often cracks will form is so I wouldn't be too worried about the fact that you had to crack 'em a which you would use a concrete car Lewis cotton specifically designed for concrete quick ... makes\nA number of these products are going to the sheer well and keep the water out and you could do this inside or outside I'd probably do both sides of the crack\nAnd you can choose a clear or a color matches the concrete so won't be too obvious but I Would simply sealing off um when you get water that comes through cracker rainfall it's very simple section and just as it is if you have one of the comes in other places in the basement\nIs really an issue of managing water in your case you've gotta practice open like that I Would simply you know and I don't think that crack is surprising or indicative of a major structural problem in itself and it got worse\nThan it could be an issue but if it's just a small crack for right now in the wall usually it's something it's caused by concrete shrinkage and it's not likely to repeat itself\nIn the ... ... ... to fix it do you think that because of that and the property let you go down than let's say\nAs long as it's what I think as a normal crack and it's not a serious one nation problem are they going to have no effect on you would like to have it inspected by structural engineer and certified that you know that it's a with a normal power

TV's this old house welcome Tommy thank you nice to be here you know inadvertently laying down a hot pot are scratching the surface can definitely want to be one of those sort of oh no\nHoly cow other words that I Can't say on the radio ... you're saying right yeah I mean how do you get out of those problems are those types of things fixable\nOr in some cases if the hot pot is down there and it's just bubble the countertop you may be able to re heat it sounds silly the hot pot losing that now you've got to read it to break back down but you actually got to soften the adhesives underneath the contact that Egypt and sometimes you can actually re fascinated if you have a role or\nTake out your old roller derby rolling the dough and rule that countertop in until it cools down and sometimes you can read thousands even without getting additional he's been there just where I get it to re stick itself sort of you right away exactly exactly this\nIs sort of you've got to react as it's happening\nThat well no you can eat and then he hit the Pentagon and\nPut it down but somehow it's smarter than you are right away oh my God I get the road\nWhat if you have a physical damage in the countertop hum is there a way to kind of do selective surgery and just replace one one chunk of it\nYeah you can cut it in a cutting board is probably the easiest way if it's if the cutting board is in a good location right um\nBut uh basically you're essentially cutting out the area of limited and replacing it with a cutting\nBoard yeah and they have different kinds of cutting boards you can get a solid surface cutting board you can get to where they got like a ... you can get a wooden cutting board\nYou know what the beautiful things about doing that and somebody else will come into your house and that we can go wow I didn't have cutting boards and I had a great I value does well it is that ruin it and then you can get one hand\nIt's sort of done as like a drop in tray almost have to drop and think would be installed hangar it fits\nIn ... some ... they have this little metal ring that goes around it ... metal ring in some of the kind of boy just cutting boards fit in that little ring dropping and you can actually ... flip it over so when you wear it out if you use and like I wouldn't want\nYou know one of the other common thing that I've noticed when we first bought our house we had a lovely Pepto bismol pink a lemon ... then you know while we lived with it for a while until they could afford the grant at\nThat age just kept popping off and I feel like that's always one of the areas that failed first yeah what can you do to make that sort of either re attached to replace it\nWith lots of times you can take an edge it's usually the corner you're dead right on it's usually the corner because you're running by that comment you get a check on it once you've caught it you've got to either try to heat it back on with an iron soften it gently the glue and then you push it back on with a roller or something from\nA and if that doesn't work and you can't get it all the pieces broken out you're going to have to replace it and you're gonna have to find peace somewhere in the kitchen usually beside the stove or the refrigerator or in a dead corner you may be able to steal a peace right outta that corner and patch it right into that piece that's that's ah been damaged\nAnd you don't use any buffer between the iron and the and the laminate itself you don't need like a towel just to prevent further burning\nYou gotta make sure that you don't overheat the
