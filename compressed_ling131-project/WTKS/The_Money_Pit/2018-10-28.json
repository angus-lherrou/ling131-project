{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Off and I asked him I said have you ever done clans and they're like way I've done some kind of plan I ask them all tell me about your plans and they tell me that the you know they did the kind of thing that you can go to Walmart and you can buy over the counter you can go to a GNC and buy over the counter or whatever and and all of those programs they're advertised\nFor people who are don't have the understanding there for the blind leading the blind and you're never going to get their ... benefits that you're looking for and it's like okay well if you're filters are still clogged yeah you're going to have a hard time losing weight so the people who are doing the right thing who are already putting in quality ingredients into their body\nAs good as they may be feeling now okay they're gonna feel significantly better and it's going to be so much easier and they're going to get so much of a better product from the fall clean up or even the spring cleaning then Dr supervise detox program why because they're already doing Ninety percent of the work\nOkay [noise] so when you do this or are you hungry all the time\nNo you're eating the whole day mark you're eating or drinking something pretty much\nEvery hour and your body's getting plenty of ingredients and its energized Dennis it's preparing you to do what you need to do and then when you're flushing you're still taking in a bunch of ingredients why because you need to feed the body in order to get the body to do what you're asking you to do which is clean the filters\nRight it's got to keep moving things sort of you want to clean water filter you got to move water through it that is exactly correct got it got it now are there are there different supplements you would use during fall cleanup\nThat depends on the individual if somebody comes in and they have let's say a condition called ... they're going to need some extra support because of this\nIn addition if somebody comes in and they have asthma they're going to need some extra support because of their condition if somebody comes in and they have or a psoriasis or an eczema they're going to need some extra support to support their condition and uh\nYou know if you don't have any of those things and you just want to do a clean up then there's what the ingredients that come with the program are sufficient for the average person who doesn't have a you know major health issues but if you have a major health issue than we want to support\nWhatever is is associated with that health issues so that we can get\nChanged within that condition so that you don't have to keep it for the rest of your life and that's the reason why we require them to come in and do a brief evaluation and ah if they come in and do the brief evaluation and do the program a that's um you know there's no charge for that evaluation\nOh great now it sounds like this is something that nearly everyone could do\nAre there any people who would be it would not be recommended for\nUm if I had to think about anybody who it wouldn't be okay for I nothing comes to mind mark or anybody no matter what their state of their digestive system no matter what's been done to them\nOr as long as they're still eating food and the screening food uh we can modify or or go about a way to support their system to get through this process and it honestly shouldn't be an issue\nI think I mean that's pretty important to understand because this fall clean up is being supported basically by foods that you're taking in to help flush the system it's not that you're taking in things that might be country indicated for somebody that had a a severe health problems\nRight and we work with the body to do his job and the funny thing happens is when you work with the body to do his job and we cleaned filters out sometimes they come out of the other side of their fault cleanup program and they no longer have their condition therefore they no longer need their medication which was probably clogging the filters to begin with\nAnd so what I Want to listeners to appreciate is that we're in this window of opportunity for the fall clean up the fall cleanup starts October twenty first and it runs through December seventh\nAnd so what's important is that you the listener you need to find nine days within your schedule that's basically a Saturday through the following Sunday if you want to look at it from that perspective\nBut you need to find nine days within your schedule could to get this program in now we have this wonderful holiday that's unique to our country a long about the end of the third week of of ah November called Thanksgiving right okay so you can do this program before Thanksgiving\nAnd you'll have a much better Thanksgiving or you're gonna think to yourself well I'm going to go to hell in a hand basket on Thanksgiving because I get to have an Judy special pie and neither is the only time of year that I eat it so I Want to make sure that I can have that\nGood well you can also get the fall cleanup done after Thanksgiving but there's a smaller window of opportunity because you have to start\nBy ah like the twenty ninth of ... of November So you got a week to play with after Thanksgiving in which to get at least started because you have to be done by the seventh of December\nWhether you you know just thinking about it just in terms of what the holiday means if you could if you could do something this much to take this kind of good care of your health you it'd be already tuned into being very grateful so that when Thanksgiving rolled around you would have a different way of approaching that holiday altogether\nRight and another thing is is even if you do the fall clean up after Thanksgiving\nIt's going to set you up for success and not packing on thirty or forty pounds come new year which so many people do at the beginning of the year\nThat says another thing to consider yeah so if somebody is out there and and ... is considering that this was intriguing and something that they want to find out some more information about or they want to actually where you directly about their particular situation and find out\nHow you might handle them in guiding them through this kind of a fall clean up what were the best way to reach you\nAll the best way to reach me like I say every week is is just to either come into the office directly at one thirty eight canal street and pulled her park again that sweet for zero for building four hundred that addresses on my website which is fine boy dot com\nOr you can call me directly which is really the best way to talk to me area code eight four or five\nFive six one to two to five that would be a good suggestion a if you're passive\nIf you're going to send me an email anyway asking for the fall cleanup manual I Will email it to you and then we can start a dialogue there\nUm and I just want to know what your health concerns are what about them affects your life why you don't want them anymore and then let's talk about what we have to do to get rid of them wanted for also that you can get off that treadmill of treatment that you've been on for however long you been on it\nThen and to be able to get off to the treatment of a you know the the uh the consistent treatments where you're taking daily medications and being able to be free from that and not have to think about that and to be healthy again is such an advantage in life I mean I you know there's there's no way to be able to measure how valuable it is to have your health\nRight but it is easy to measure how valuable it is to not have your health because you don't go to parties you don't go out anymore you can't\nPlay ball with your grandkids you can't go to the mall to go shopping you can't uh you know participate in the family events et cetera and and what what is that costing you that's costing you basically the joy of your life so\nGive us a shot and give me a call and let's have a conversation and uh let's see what we can do to change your life by a cleaning out some of your filters\nSo I Want

smokers and everything and you have to pull out those materials and seal underneath them you were trying to clear it\nOkay and do you guys have any recommendations is there any way like to clean the duct work or anything to\nDo well in a bunch of money on all the rest of them and then if you don't get a job in\nMay just be dusty I don't know that that's going to be the biggest problem I think you're going to find the most this odor is is not some duck ... metal you know doesn't really soak in stuff mhm so I didn't get my most of this is going to be in the drywall in in support in the carpet and then those surfaces and that's why they have to be clean primed and then re painted\nSomething about what they are so you'll see color primer\nYeah I Would recommend that using oil based crime or for this is a really good job of stealing and whatever's underneath the ... and that will be all you needed the support you covered back over the other point when referring down you want to do that but for the walls\nYou can go ahead and prime them in and then you could do top where paint over that but you got to do that for several users solving based rubbish primer for no K\nAwesome thank you guys I greatly appreciate\nYour show every walk I'm Sorry that happened to you good luck with that project cutting California has got the money paid how can we help you today\nIn our rent though we have a a big wall a brick fireplaces and it's a dark corner like wondering if we will be able to paint that bricks without a whole lot of trouble to bring it up in that corner\nYou can pay that but you better be sure what you want to do ...\nYeah I mean painting breaking it it's kind of an irreversible once you put the paint on because the breakfast so poor it's just going to get sucked into like every little interior neck and cranny of that breakfast should you ever decide that you would like to be broke again it's a lot of stripping than blasting it's a big to do\nSo you want to make sure that that's something you really want to do I mean if it's like the ugliest forever I get it\nWell it's the only way to lighten up that area that I can think of ... it's like a corner\nIt's like a corner of the living room but it's one wall of the living room wall right up next to the sliding glass door the all the way over those planes to store all brick floor to ceiling you\nThought about putting mirrors like an sorted group of mirrors or\nAdding a different light fixture I mean there are ways that you can write in the face with decoration\nI hadn't thought of the mirrors that might be a good idea\nI mean if you do like a cute cluster almost like a little gallery grouping of different size and shape mirrors and mixing\nMetal and you know doing something really purposeful and finding creating a moment like that's a great way to do it there's no electrical\nYou know\nYou don't need electrical and the feeling there plenty of ... plug into an outlet that you can use a flag\nThat flag [laughter] now flag yeah I I think so\nUm you can do something like that and there I mean there are really great way to do that they plug in a light fixture and then suddenly have a beautiful like many chandelier or something there are so many if you look on line for\nDecorative light fixture with a plug in like with the plug you'll find so many okay and then make sure you can get one of those things that look like a country that Iraq over the electrical cord itself so high system wiring and I mean it really easy to get\nAll right I think a little ones that you're in pain

the plug covers on plug something other than I is it works for the plug it didn't work on one other one didn't work so I called them back see come over the you said that must be a plug very somewhere\nThere's got to be an outlet very come on really theloop flashed the question is how can I find it\n[laughter] so this guy did all this wiring working he missed the fact that he put it a whole bunch outlets that had no power\nYou can you imagine that so that's the power\nAnd it was ridiculous is ridiculous this guy did not do his job and he should be able to detractors now for yeah\nOh yeah you might not attract and if you want to be paid for friday\nSo he won't have permission from it yeah\nYeah he wanted more money you pay them for the rest of the work already all get sold it for everything\nNow well it's not right I mean I did is going to be difficult for you to track this down without specialized tools will tell you that uh it it's kind of a matter of just taking a shortcut and starting at the panel and then following the wires up to see where they go and trying to figure out where the disconnect is\nYeah I think it's a little more complicated than that because I look for he was finally three how he why I think it's pretty obvious why like she was alive and he went from one box and then when left and then\nAlso went right from the same power so I mean that's kinda weird I Would even be and I never tried one\nYeah you might want to try tracking it from the sockets back you may have better luck trying to figure out what is this connected it sounds like you look something up though if he rewired these outlets and didn't figure out that they weren't hot to begin with that's a real problem\nWhen you replace it that they're changing the plumbing around that this is going through the steel pipes\nThey changed the hype around it and I don't think so\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's contributing the problem and need to know what the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a pressure balance it out when and where many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps the mix between hot and cold balanced so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now Rob all that hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be\nThe the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not it I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have something you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't become moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater\nGetting a plumber should know this not only to run the water heater would basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help ... help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could get into a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it would supply additional water and the second floor bathroom\nOh okay okay okay well I think that kinda runny the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet Haiti fresh

then it stopped ... and you can turn the knob around to the different psycho their thing and it does nothing\nUm have you checked the float which is in the bottom of the dishwasher to see if maybe it's become clogged\n\nYeah because if it's clogged it might think it's over ... ... that might think that a ... it's about to overflow and it's much shut the machine off to the bottom of the

worse in the trash every week whole house water filter might be a better option for you\nThat's right a whole house you'd filters the water at the main just as it comes to the house bringing you Chris clean water from every tapped into your home to learn more we turn now to this old house plumbing and heating expert Richard ... through we welcome Richard now America ensure having a version the tap water but filtering it has\nTo be better and less expensive than buying bottles or they difficult to install these shelters will\nIt really depends I mean you have to think about attacking water filtration in steps if it's a whole house you need a large unit that's going to handle all\nThe water's coming through and in that case you're going to be going after the really visible impurities dirt and rust okay um when you think about the level of water you're going to consume you have to think local you have to think about a a filter that's going to sit on the kitchen sink to give you clean beautiful water for both cooking and for your ice make\nLess true 'cause if you put it at the main me not only are you filtering your drinking water but it's also harder\nToilet water ... yeah so it's you really have to do it in steps you know where a there's a whole industry it's an industry that's growing because people are more and more worried about the quality of the water what happens if the bad guys touched the water you know just they want to have some level of security in in their house\nMhm so how do you go about choosing one and then getting unsolved\nI think it's a a dirt and rush filters what you think about it the least case that the water I mean coming in I think that's going to be a function of local water quality I mean there's so many parts in this country the water is beautiful I mean we take for granted in this country writers as good as it is\nSo you may not need that but if you had an old rusty Maine the ten year old town you know or you had a a galvanized a water main coming in\nAnd it was going to give you a lot of rushed you know you're not and you can't change that new Maine to new Maine you might want to have it during rush filtered\nOut what about a filter that goes actually at the tap I've seen a wide variety of these types of filters sometimes you see the ones that screw onto where the arid or we'd go yeah other times you see them to be large and fit inside the cabinet what's the best way to approach that well I think\nThis to all the ones that you spoke about you know the ones that go on to the end of it is her kitchen ... they will usually includes something called ... she graduated activated carbon\nAnd water goes through this carbon and it cleans it up as it comes through and so that's the least case which you would put on the kitchen sink the either the little ones you see above the sink or that these could be wants to sit down in the cash turned an effect on your cold water feed\nThe other thing that people will put in is a thing called an arrow reverse osmosis now that is a unit which will bring water through a membrane with high pressure it'll push\nThrough this membrane so only the clean water gets through the membrane and the west pressed of the water\nYou know push through this membrane the clean water and the rest of the water will discharge to a drain so it's a lot more elaborate to install on that you not only have a supply but you have a drain and people will complain that either wasting some water okay but the water level is clean and pure it's almost distilled\nAnd when it comes to changing filters get the amount of time between Celtic changes really very to the type of cleaning second you happen to where it's located\nIn well it's a function of water quality again I mean you know ... years ago we\nWe had this filter that was so good that it would clog up all the time people hated it put the water was perfectly clean because it was taken every bit out of it so it's this is this balance point between taking out the important stuff but not having to be that you have to change it every month or every every two weeks\nYou know what it is important to change that one needs to be changed because I remember in the Twenty years it's been as a home inspector I'd seen filters that folks put in with great intentions and then never touched it again for two years and in fact if you do that I guess it could become unsafe I think it also becomes almost something you put\nOn the list of when you're gonna change the batteries on smoke detectors right it's an annual thing it should
