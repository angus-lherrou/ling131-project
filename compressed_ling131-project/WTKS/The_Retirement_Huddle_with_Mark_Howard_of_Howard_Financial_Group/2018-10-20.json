came out and the facts that were allege weren't corroborated and edits it didn't seem to matter well some people would seem to matter a hit a I'm a\nStudent of mine I had a discussion was just last week and uh she's professional uh she's in the medical profession uh August she she got through our college and a medical school or I could not believe how emotional she was and how ignorant or her\nAbility was two reasons through the facts these emotional issues are I think our ... result eventually is some kind of violence is not rational\nRight and it was only in many cases you indicated so unintended consequences or something else we a touchstone for you and all of the year ... we were talking about the other\nOf a situation that seems to be a number two and a law enforcement officer injuries and that is a domestic disturbance domestic violence calls really a pretty volatile I'll\nProbably Valentines very dynamic situation is very fluid a lot of emotion and anger going on a lot of emotion and a lot of anger um we spend a lot of time in our ah\nOur training when officers are young trying to simulate doing a really a lot of scenario based training with officers and specifically with domestic a lot of ...\nTry that you know saw once again uh you know you're going to hear the same thing for me over and I was all about communication yep I'm all about threat assessment um we have also have a saying in law enforcement of complacency kills 'em you know to to subject we're talking about right now\nTraffic stops in domestics complacency plays a big factor for US Senate because a lot of times when we see an officer or he or she um gets hurt injure\n'em even worse gets killed a in relation to a traffic stop or a domestic complacency is usually a factor in there so I'm domestics you know you can go in there man and a woman fighting and you arrest one half and then they want they're calling you for help\nAnd then the minute you rest one one half of the domestic then you've got the other half of the domestic they don't want help in the morning and leave you arrest and their husband or their wife and then they want to jump on a police officer for we're big on their husband or wife to jail\nBeen there done that saying that um my experience has been that in every instance where I was involved being called to a domestic disturbance there was alcohol involved and I can't think of a single call where there was an alcohol involved [laughter] uh um and usually\nOn his part of both parties ... or some form of alcohol and drugs are and that certainly does not lend to uh people listen to reason\nA it's a tough situation for the officer to find themselves in a it's a it's easy when you've got somebody rational and calm and slack when you're dealing with\nBut boy when these emotions are rubbed raw is a is a potential for escalation is it's right there on the surface and\nThen that's what we're we're we're we're telling our officers are dead bodies were telling them you know you're there to try to make the situation better year there because someone reached out and need our help so we're trying to make the situation better ... as being there\nWere trying to make the situation better we're not trying to escalate the situation so it was a lot of training is involved in what verbal de escalation were also\nAwareness you know other than the people you know who else was in the house kids you know a lot of things a lot of people don't realize how kids are affected with domestic disputes\nWhen officers are trained to get in there to try to get things calm down trying to get things in a manageable order and see to the needs of the of the kids because a lot of times they're there to innocent victims and to\nShow up again it's a potentially a explosives in dangerous situations\nAnd in it it's very challenging for officers because\nIt's a it's a balancing act and it's hard to do sometimes for some officers as it is hard for all officers to do some are better than others it's about and I thought about that\nYou're the situation or a traffic stop day and a domestic both um how you talk to people can get you in the in the boss's office can get you an internal affairs complained only so but when you're on the scene handling the situation you got to be tactical\nYou got to be tied to cook your own safety you got to be professional\nAnd you got to be courteous that's a heck of a balanced and that may have some time for some of these situations you're trying to be you know being in having a tactical mindset having a professional mindset but also having a ... a a massive courtesy so that's some officers struggle with that because they have to overlap\nIn in its is very very stressful very hard on the officers I'm In ... we go back and look at body camera footage now and we were we do these training reviews and we we talk to the officers and okay this happened here was you aware that this person walking around behind you\nAnd they're like I had no idea I mean if you watch these body camera vision is television ... and that's the same thing same stresses and frustration and in influences that people do you live out there and the community is the same stressors in influence there is that our police officers are dealing with the when they're trying to handle the situation\nA goal who's being tactical and a ... full right at the same time that you're right it's a balancing his training and continue reviewing\n... a lot of skill um and not you know the biggest thing for us with that is not no two the two calls are the same are we talking about a little earlier and uh you know especially when officer\nRobs a repeat calls to a residence for domestic and you know after the fifth time there over a three month period or fifth time there over a six month period a little bit of complacency comes in play there for the officer because they feel they get a little bit since a comfortable in this would this couple\nBut you don't know what is that this is that all this time you don't know what what's involved in this and then in the flu is dynamic this could be the one time that you got there it is a game changer\nSays ... each successive disturbance tends to be at a higher level as I was until he was very surreal and if there's a lot of intervention right\nNear the verbal judo thing to the ... very very important in that\nThe verbal judo comes into the professionalism in the courtesy part of it that we don't what we say can open the door and and create some other issues and problems for us so we have to be careful what we say on our end as well virtual or ... or ... or audience\nWill glean\nSome positive from ...\nIowa with or without a doubt no such thing as a as a routine traffic stop and domestic violence was one of the one of the most dicey situations a police ever face that we'll have more with Gary coming up maybe in a week or so Rob let's see if we can do it All right we'll get to know

the reason that you'd want to switch if you've already got a good relationship with one you know I Would just say you know probably not a good reason to change\nJust because the guy has a fascinating personality and tells good jokes is not a good reason not a good reason to switch your advisor you're listening to the retirement huddle around sets along with mark Howard of our financial group just a couple of more here mark if you don't mind\nI like my advisor but I've recently moved to a different state and I'm Wondering if I should be working with somebody local instead that may be more of a legitimate question\nYeah and you know for many this is a a personal choice I think it's many people it for them it's important to meet face to face and that's just a question that the client really needs to ask you know I've got clients\nOver the country I've got many clients that don't live in the area and we have regular phone conversations and we still try to meet face to face at least once a year especially but that's important to him sometimes we do it on a a weapon or a sky or just whatever method that they want that makes them comfortable to get the job done but\nThere are certainly a lot of people that want to have that that face to face relationship and those face to face meetings at least once a year or several times a year and a half people coming into my office all the time that say hey I've just moved in the area and I want to local advisor so once again personal choice but that can be a good reason to to strike up a relationship with someone in your area\nI can definitely see that and a mark one last situation here and this one is a loaded question so let's talk about here but uh if a person says to you the market crashed and I lost a ton of money in my portfolio why with response to that person\nI Would ask them to begin with are you surprised that you lost money I mean were you not aware of the risky we're taking ... did your financial advisor not disclosed the risk properly and what kind of plan did you have you know are you thirty eight years older you're sixty two years old\nAnd I have very different repercussions you know the sixty two you don't have time to make up those losses so I Would say if you're close to retirement and you've lost money especially if you weren't aware that you could lose the money\nThat may be a good reason to find a different advisor at least strike up a relationship with one that specializes in retirement income planning\nBecause they can show you how to have a plan in place that focuses on preservation in principle protection and that's so important that you get close to retirement you can't afford to be losing money that close to retirement so it may be that you're ripe for that that type of\nAdditional relationship and your financial life for somebody to help you to and through retirement get you out a risk\nSounds like there may have been a little lack of communication between this person and uh his or her advisor and that's really a tough situation better so hey you might want to think about switching you know if if you're going to switch to somebody who I mean it says if you have an advisor already\nGet more power to chance because he would love to get to know you what happens when someone comes in and or for that get acquainted visit with absolutely no obligation and no cost and do you offer it all the time what do you have to offer those folks\nAre wrong we just want to make sure that that people are well prepared for retirement it's something we're passionate about

well not from the sidelines but he'll be right there beside you and provide you with as much assistance as you need\nTo call is eight eight eight five one one plan that is eight eight eight five one one plan eight eight eight five one one Seventy five to six that'll put you in touch with Howard financial group\nIf you live in Savannah Hilton Head wherever you are in the country come on and have a conversation with mark Howard no obligation do cost eight eight eight five one one plan is your number to call\nMark you know when when it comes to retirement planning and and that's of course what this whole show is all about planning for your retirement in the right way\nThere are some rules of thumb and I wonder do you find these rules of bummed to be helpful or not some may apply some may be just you know things that have\nCome and gone tell me if they're appropriate if you're what first of all what is the rule of one hundred and is it something that you should use in your retirement planning\nI think the rule of one hundred is a great way to determine how much risk you should have and I think it begins with a question\nAnd we asked folks that come to our dinner events should a thirty five year old invest the same as the sixty five year old when of course everyone nods their head no and I asked why not\nAnd you get some ... and diverse answers from that but typically say well you know the thirty five year old got more time to make up losses exactly that sixty five year old does not have the time horizon some make up a market correction so the rule of one hundred is a great way to kind of get people's\nHead on straight about how much risk they should be exposed to based on their time horizon and where they are in life and it's very simple you take a hundred and you subtract your age and what's left is the amount of risk that you should have so for example if someone is sixty years old one hundred miles of sixty is forty\nForty percent should be the amount of risk that they should have any of their portfolio exposed to\nThe run that means that sixty percent\nOf their portfolio should be in safe stock market alternatives where it's immune to a stock market correction\nAnd I will tell you I sit down with folks in their late sixties early seventies mid seventies all the time\nAnd their portfolio does not look anything like that and so when we talk about this rule which seemed to be a universal rule for years with financial advisors but somewhere along the line it's kind of been discarded it seems like the world of Wall Street wants to\nContinue to have your assets under management and control those assets so that they can get a residual income from it what we do is in power clients with how they can get a residual income\nFrom their portfolio so it's a great rule and I think it really it really wake some people up as to boy I might be overexposed and yes if if the market that has a correction like it did in a way to know not I'm not going to have time to make it up\nOkay so the rule of one hundred is certainly come down on the positive side how about the Seventy five percent rule one is that\nWell the Seventy five percent rule it's a much touted rule of thumb and basically it says that you'll need somewhere between Seventy to eighty percent of your pre retirement income after you finish working now you know some planners are suggesting that might not be enough\nI Am in that category I don't feel like that's enough and there's just too many unknowns out there between health care and inflation and so forth so we work toward a hundred percent of their pre retirement income and we really focused especially those first ten years after they stop working\nPleased yes it certainly is you didn't see too many people were both as fact\nA bed as are getting to know you start to finish in retirement [noise]\nWe're going to make sure you know the exits and does your financial player [noise]\nYou're listening to the retirement huddle with mark coward of Howard financial group from wherever you are and the country's a van a Hilton Head wherever\nYou are certainly mark can help you at Howard financial group and it's time for a story and I love hearing these stories marked 'cause I Know you've been doing this a long time and you probably have\nJust an abundance of stories you could tell us what narrowed down to one if you would tell us about a time when you watch someone having a ha moment when he came to understanding their financial planner all of a sudden it just clicked\nOh well let's see one comes to mind a couple that came in to see me I'll change their name to John and Jane okay it's about as good as I can get right now but John and Jane wonderful couple John was about sixty two\nJane was about sixty one she was a year younger and they came to me and they had a portfolio and they wanted a second opinion and they said you know we just feel like we're on a pretty good track and we just would like to see what kind of recommendations you might have for us to improve it\nSo their plan Ron they both wanted to retire right around full retirement age Social Security was by age sixty six [noise]\nAnd they knew what their Social Security benefits were going to be at that point and their income goal was about six thousand dollars a month after taxes\nSo when you factor in their Social Security if both of them triggered it sixty six the other part of the equation John had about a half million in this four one K. so they'd done a great job of saving\nTogether they hadn't joined account with about two hundred and fifty thousand in it and then they had invested in a typical mix that a financial advisor would would recommend sixty percent stocks forty percent months\nSo they came to me and\nFirst thing we did is we talked a little bit about longevity as to John tell me a little bit about your family we talked more about the goals John assumed he was going to live\nAbout to eighty five we had to talk about the longevity piece that's the piece that we the mystery you know we just don't know how long we're going to live so we've got to prepare for a long line Jane had a lot of longevity on her side she assumed Ninety eight Ninety\nSo we ran a stress tests run if you've ever been to the doctor really put you on the treadmill did a stress test absolutely yeah sure half\nWell what do they try to do they try to kill you [laughter] it seems like it at a time yes yeah\nSo that's what we did is we tried to stress their particular situation and see what is the likely outcome that their money is going to last until John's eighty five and Jane is is Ninety and our stress tests came out to a sixty five percent probability\nNow I don't know how you feel about probabilities but when I look at sixty five percent I look at that and go that's not good enough for me exact and it wasn't good enough for them either\nSo we did a first tweak what I call it and what we did is we just did a they optimization\nAnalysis of their Social Security\nAnd when we ran the numbers on that we realized that if John held off on taking his Social Security to late Seventy he would get a much bigger benefit of course Jane could go ahead and begin hers earlier and then once John turned Seventy she was going to get half of his so they were going to get\nQuite a bit more money by just waiting on the Social Security peace with just a little bit of a two week\nWe re ran the stress test\nAnd then it went from sixty five percent likelihood of having enough money in retirement to a Seventy nine percent likelihood now a lot better but Ron if I said hey there's a plane waiting for you at the airport and it has a Seventy nine percent chance of being on time [laughter]\nYou probably say well that's that's about far for the court has right airline and [laughter]\nBut if I told you it had a Seventy nine percent chance of actually making it to its destination in other words it had a Twenty one percent chance of crashing\nHow would you feel about that no way I'm getting on that plane [laughter] away absolutely and that's not good enough either so what we did is we did a second optimization and we just tweaked their portfolio\nAnd all we did is we reposition some of their assets in those two accounts that I just mentioned so that they can maintain returns so they could reduce risk\nAnd we set 'em up with a personal pension with some of that money to where it would trigger in income stream when they were ready that they would never outlive we ran the stress test Ninety seven percent success probability that would have enough money in print retirement All right all the way those ages so that\nWas a huge a ha moment for John and Jane because they had never looked at they just thought they saved enough oh this'll last but they hadn't really thought out of distribution strategy and when we started to stress test their portfolio\nAnd stress stress their plan or lack there of we were able to show them the holes in that plan and show them a way that we could drastically increase that success probability that they would have a long and happy retirement as long as they may live or mark I know that\nThe cool thing about all that is the fact that that story right there\nIs probably representative of a lot of other folks that developed over the years\nYou have lots of aha moments with people sitting in your office I Know you're going to continue to do that and a lot of our listeners today may have an awful moment in the future if they'll just get in touch with you at Howard financial story time on our show today the retirement puzzle thanks for being with us we'll have more\nMake sure you are not backed up against your own end zone and retirement draw but winning game plan and after the retirement total\nWelcome back into the retirement huddle I'm Russ that's along with mark Howard the president of Howard financial group and if you are in Savannah Hilton Head anywhere in the country you can come in and have a conversation\nWith market Howard financial group about your situation they show is all about preparing for retirement and doing it in the right way and mark our and has nearly three decades of experience in the financial industry he has to financial gain planning is willing to share it with you all you got to do is call this number\nEight eight eight five one one plan and his eight eight eight five one one plan you can come in for a get acquainted conversation will cost you anything at all and there's no obligation eight eight eight five eleven\nSeven five to six is your number to call mark Howard is the name he's on the radio every week was talking about finishing the race and I just happen to know that you have\nRun some races in the past and\nI don't know how excited you are about going out and doing one right now but uh we had quite a bit of fun in the past doing these things are getting through retirement can be a lot like running a marathon so let's talk about some of the similarities first of all you don't just\nGo out and run a marathon without any preparation without really thinking about it just get up one day and say I think I'm going to go run the New York marathon just doesn't happen that way you have to have a lot of preparation you have to plan and it's the same thing really when it comes to\nGetting ready for your retirement you don't just do it without thinking about it there's a lot that goes into it yeah that's true\nYou know I think a lot of people assume that training for a marathon just involves going for a long run every so often but it there is a lot of planning and it is really a six to eight month commitment to prepare for one\nAnd it's interesting to me that the training there's a lot of books out there about how the train and so forth it's not a one size fits all\nI did a a a marathon up it's been a while since I've done my last one but I've done a couple\nBut I had to really find a way to train that works for me you know my schedule my particular fitness level and at the time I had never run more than a ten K. before so I had to really be careful not to to go out there and try these long runs and an increase my mileage too quickly\nSo I was able to limit myself to just one long run per week and I would typically do that on Sunday\nAnd I had to play all kinds of mental tricks and so forth ... for example\nI Would always run for time instead of distance and what I mean by that it uh I go out and not run for okay my long run today is for two hours and I didn't care how long I went how far I went I just knew I needed to go out and our come back an hour so it took me six or seven months to prepare\nAnd there's so many ups and downs during that period you'll have setbacks you get sick I had a hip issue or couldn't run for a while had shin splints so you have to adapt your training and even stop every so often recover and get the setbacks and run I it's a great analogy it's a great analogy for life on a microcosm of life\nBut also when it comes to retirement planning because everybody's different everybody's got a different situation they're in different stages of life\nSome of say more than others some have pensions you know everybody's got different dollars invested in different ways trying to accomplish a different ... retirement goal and and\nYou know the portfolio has got to have some planning behind it it just can't be haphazard and there's going to be setbacks they're ... they're going to be things in life that happened last going up those curves job losses divorce\nMarket corrections you know just any number of things so as you get closer to the race or in this case the date you plan to retire you've got to become more conservative you got to take less risk you know you don't want to be doing a bunch of long runs and\nSo forth after you put in all of this preparation and then you're so close to the race and have a an injury occur right before the the race day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Retirement Huddle with Mark Howard of Howard Financial Group", "city":
