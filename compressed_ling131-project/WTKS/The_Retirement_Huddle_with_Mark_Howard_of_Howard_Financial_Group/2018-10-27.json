companies saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nBecause there's so many different influences on her stock market among those fear and innuendo and uncertainty\nAnd when you look at the volatility index of the market it's driven by investors feelings about things so we know feelings can drive behavior and we know that when the market gets into a little bit of a of a nosedive and do a little bit of a correction people start to panic and it just seems to exasperated itself\nWell I remember when I was a little kid we're we're talking to my grandma's financial wisdom I Would ask my grandmother a question\nAnd really expecting a a a really good answer there was going to take care of my problem whatever was and she would look at me and she was say run you never know and I'm going but that doesn't help at all but it's really kind of a wise thing to say and it flies through our financial lives as well\nYeah it does it I think today's equivalent of that that I hear people saying is it is what it is yeah exactly and it drives me\nCrazy highlighted are [laughter] but it's it is probably true that sometimes you never know what one hundred percent certainty about anything\nBut you know it's also true there are some things in life we can do with a lot more certainty than other things and certainly when it comes to retirement planning it's about balancing those different elements of certainty and uncertainty and what we're able to do here\nOur financial group is is through that proper planning and the tools we used to stress tests the plan\nWe can show our clients that hey if you're going to live to a hundred and Ninety eight percent likelihood you're not going to run out of money you know and that's about a sure thing in life is you're going to find so there are some things that we can just about come up with a hundred percent certain the you know short of a somebody pressing the button on a on a nuclear bomb or something like that\nWe're talking with mark Howard of course Howard financial group or on their retirement huddled today Welcome into the huddle we're glad you're here and a mark Howard is one where the game plan and Howard financial group and we'll get back to that and just a moment but another\nThing that grandma used to say is a bad apple spoils the whole barrel now what exactly did grandma mean by that\nWell it it certainly can be true with your investments you know if you're relying too heavily on one particular investment and its spoils you can be in trouble and you know one thing I've seen happening is is bad apple scenario\nSeems to be an issue in the world the newer these it really bothers me because there's a lot of different types of annuities out there and it just seemed like they get all painted with the same big opinion brush for example\nThere's an annuity called the variable annuity and we don't like those because\nForbes magazine did a study in the bed every one of them out there and they said the average variable annuity has fees of three point six percent per year ouch now and they have a risk of loss as well you got a hundred thousand in a variable annuity you're paying thirty six hundred dollars a year and fees it's just crazy it's ridiculous\nSo I Would say first of all anybody listening to this broadcast has one of those please call us we rescue people from them all the time but there's other types of annuities at a great planning tools for guaranteed lifetime income\nAnd those types of things and one is called the fix indexed annuity\nIn these things are amazing run the guarantee your principal in your gains they are some of the best ways to guard against a bear market on the planet that exist but it just seems to some people you know all the new these get thrown into the same bucket\nAnd that's really a shame because like I said some of these annuities are outstanding and they can be very critical parts of a lifetime income stream and other retirement plan\nYeah very unfair and unwise to lump all those annuities together in the same category\nAnother thing that to your grandma might have said in western North Carolina I heard it straight and the horse's mouth now that's something that you sometimes hear these days in fact I think I taught myself saying that just a week or so ago but\nWhat exactly does that mean coach our [laughter] well\nYou know it it means that you went to the source and you heard it was it through a third party or anything like that\nSometimes run we have to do that in the world of investing you know when we're starting to do things like us the analysis for example someone brings a portfolio when there's different things we can do we can run Morningstar reports\nBut one of the best ways to determine what the true fees are specially and things like those variable annuities that I was just talking about is we play a little game called called the company\nAnd this is where we call him and we know what to ask all we can get through the smoke and mirrors and we can find out exactly what you're invested in and what it's costing\nAnd you don't typically want to ask the questions to the person that soldier that kind of product you can go to the straight to the horse's mouth and that's the company and you can get down and dirty with exactly what those the structures are and boy it it really\nIs illuminating for a lot of people a lot of people come out of that phone call going good lord I had no idea\nYeah the key is in most of us are wouldn't know what the question's word that we should ask that you as a financial advisor and you've been doing this very long time know exactly what to ask and you can go to really get down to the bottom of him and hear the answer straight from the horse's mouth one more I wanted to throw at you here and ah\nThis is one that I used to her all the time particularly when I was a teenager [laughter]\nYou asked me ... you know you got all your friends are going to go to a concert let's say\nOr some trip out of town or whatever and they're all going to go and then your parents don't want your ego and then you say well so and so John and ... ... Julian marry are all going to go and the answer to that you get back was if your friends all jumped off a bridge would you do it too [laughter]\nI used to frustrate me to no end but I guess that applies to it certainly applies to financial planning doesn't it\nYeah it does in you know I think a lot of people get into certain investments because their friend or the brother in law said they should at is probably not the greatest approach to retirement planning don't because the fact is yeah everybody's different in so much of the time\nHave people come in and they'll say something like well someone so told me that that this is really good and\nSo and so's in a different situation completely they might have a pension and they might have a million dollars saved but the person in front of me is not in that category so that's why when we do a plan it's customized it's not cookie cutter and the other advantage that somebody like me is able to offer over someone else is\nThat I'm an independent I'm not a captive agent with any particular company so I've got the ability to look\nAt the whole the whole world of investment opportunities in vehicles and find what is best for that particular person and I'm not married any company nor are being forced to to offer the play of the day so to speak like somebody brokerage houses so\nThat it's very important that uh customize plan B built for you because everybody's needs goals and objectives are different\nYou're listening to their retirement huddle with mark Howard and if you would like to come in and have a conversation with

a conversation with mark\nArgued that phone number again eight eight eight five one one plan that is eight eighty eight five eleven plan eight eight eight five one one Seventy five to six\nThis program is all about getting ready for retirement having a good plan in place and making sure you can reach all the goals set for yourself and your retirement\nAnd of course the first thing you need to do is set those goals think about the kind of retirement that you want to have and you've come to the right place because mark Howard's been doing this for a very long time almost three decades of experience or the financial industry\nIs a published author and the wall Street Journal barons south magazine and other publications\nIt's also been featured on the savannah morning news\nAnd market is thought I Would take a moment to say good things about you hope you don't mind thank you very much for those are things right handed has certainly say about yourself but you can have a friend brag on you so that's that's what I'm doing so\nWell it's always nice to to do this show is you run your really appreciate your professionalism and you know just an honor to to do it with the with such a legend golden pipes\nShare right well folks in the radio audience out there today\nCertainly can depend on you to help them because you've help so many individuals and couples and families all over the area was talking about going against the grain you know being good financial advisor it's not about winning a popularity contest\nOr just saying the same things that everybody else in the industry says that you probably went a lot of popularity contest but that's not really what it's all about it's about giving the best advice you can for each individual situation so that maybe we can discuss some areas where your opinions might not be popular with other people and\nThe financial industry number one the appropriate amount of risk for a retiree or pre retiree what would you say about that\nWell it's a good question that goes back to that rule of one hundred that's a great way to determine how much risk you should be exposed to based on your age\nAnd we talk so much about different analogies a lot of people like the mountain analogy when it comes to retirement and if you look at retiring lack of climbing a mountain there's two ways we can do it Ron one way we can freestyle right we can chalk up our hands and put on a pair of cut off\nAnd we can go up that baby and we might get close to the top but if we have one slip yeah what's gonna happen it's all over we're going down right that's right we're going to probably die that the other way is to put some ropes on her shoulder\nGet some spikes and ... and ... and we'd go up and once we get up about twenty feet we can\nDrive a spike into that rock and we can clip on and that way we know\nOh that if we fall we're only going to fall that far ... and those are the types of plans that we can put together for people you know the highest mountain in the world's Mount Everest and if you focus on getting to the top of that thing it's all about growth and accumulation on the front side\nBut on the back side it's got to be about protection and distribution you gotta have a plan that gets some of those funds in a place where the market has a correction it's not going to hurt you and you got to make sure you got those guaranteed lifetime income streams and place\nI Would imagine it's fun to ... to fall down the mountain and uh it's probably not even funny but if you're anchored by those ropes and everything else but by golly you're not going to lose everything if that happens to you so you got to have a plan if that's the main thing you've got to have the proper tools\nAnd again mark Howard can help you achieve all of those and acquire all of those puppy appropriate use civil life insurance what would you have to tell our listeners about that\nLife insurance is a wonderful tool it is a tool that has become an asset class unto itself when it comes to retirement I'll give you a very personal example my father who was a local dentist passed away unexpectedly at age sixty\nAnd he had put in place\nThings that we didn't know about at the time but one of them was a nice life insurance policy because my mom was fifty seven years old when he passed where and of course when he passed what do you think stopped immediately that was that income so thank goodness he had life insurance in place\nTo make sure that if he didn't live long enough\nThat all of his loved ones are taken care of he also had things in place to where is he lived a long time\nHis loved ones would be taking care of as what he so lots of great insurance products out there lots of different types of life insurance and it is a wonderful tool to use as a part of a retirement income plan\nYour dad was a smart guy I'm Sorry about him passing away so young sixty is not over these days that's for sure no not at all how about the appropriate use of annuities what would you say about that particular thing and do you go against the grain with your advice\nI Believe I probably do because I think this has to go ... going back to we talk about Wall Street and their beliefs and they're wanting to kind of control people's assets an asset center management\nAnnuities I think if you really understand how they work I think a lot of people have heard the word\nAnd I just don't think that a lot of people really I've found that what a lot of people think they know they don't know so did describe an annuity very quickly as lots of different types but annuities just it's a pension plan just like Social Security you purchase it from an insurance company", "show_name": "The Retirement Huddle with Mark Howard of Howard
