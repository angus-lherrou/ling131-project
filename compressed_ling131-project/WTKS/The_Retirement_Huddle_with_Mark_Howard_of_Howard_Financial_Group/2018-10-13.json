{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Is going to have in some cases a different tax rule that applies to it so I Am not a CPA I Am not a tax attorney I didn't spend the night in the holiday inn last night but just just to throw out six common types of retirement income that are taxed out their Social Security\nYou know if you're only source of retirement income Social Security and we certainly don't want that to happen\nBut you probably won't pay any taxes in retirement but if you've got other sources of income than a portion of your Social Security income will likely be taxed and then you've got IRAs and four one K. withdrawals and you know most of withdrawals from those accounts are taxed in retirement because that money went in before it was taxed\nAnd I'm Talking about for one's case about four three bees for fifty seven so those are all reported on your tax return is taxable income and the amount of tax you pay on those depends on the amount of income and the amount of deductions that you have what tax bracket you're in for that year\nAnd a real quick the others are just pensions you know most pension income is taxable and most pension income is coming from a an account that was funded with pre tax dollars then you've got annuity distribution this is a wonderful thing to have in retirement and if\nYou're in ... and I are re or another retirement account than the tax rules are going to apply to that and of course if you're a new T. was purchased with after tax dollars then you're going to have very little tax if not\nAny and then you've got investment income you know you're going to pay taxes on dividends and interest income and capital gains and that type of thing and and\nA lot of people sell their home and downsize once they get into a retirement so gains upon the sale of your home but then there's some rules that apply there is you know if you've lived in your home for two years\nYou're most likely not going to pay taxes on the gains from the sale of the house unless you got gains in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand if you're single or a half million if you're married so\nYou know all these things factor in I see it as a big kind of a misnomer it's almost been a Wall Street myth that you're going to be in a lower tax rate once you retire you know the fact is is hopefully you're going to be earning eighty five percent or a hundred percent of what you were earning pre retirement\nSo are you may not be paying less in taxes plus we don't know what the tax rates are going to be who's going to be an office et cetera\nExactly that's a big key right there and a lot of people I daresay probably don't really give a lot of thought to the tax situation after they retire unless they're working with the good advisor\nSuch as yourself as they have a good coach and a lot of people right now might be thinking in their heads what strategies cannot use when I'm Still working in my job to improve my tax situation down the road after I retire what can they do\nWell there are some great strategies that you can utilize and of course financial advisors typically as a whole\nCan't give tax advice but we are well informed about the tax implications of the strategies that we recommend so first thing we've got to do is just look at\nWhat percentage of your your nest egg so to speak is qualified money and what that term means as best way to remember is that those are the funds that are qualified to be taxed when you pull it out\nSo that'd be things like your four one K. and your IRAs\nAnd then we got to determine when you're going to need it and then we got to look at it\nHow old you are when you're retiring because of course the government's going to force you to start taking money out once you turn seven and a half something called required minimum distributions\nSo there are some great strategies we can utilize based on where a person is how much they've got say how much income that they need some times opening a Roth IRA ... is a good way to go ahead and get some of that money that you're in partnership with Uncle Sam on and go ahead and take the tax consequences on it put it in a raw\nLots of different things that we can do and and there's so many different ways to handle that once again based on a person's individual situation and you know where they are in life how much they say that cetera\nI Know that you've been doing this for a very long time and you've seen just about every kind of scenario that get it and example or or maybe a couple of examples of a bad tax mistake that you've seen people make with their investments that could have been avoided if they just come in and talk with you first\nOh boy there's a lot of them run I Would say this when it had attacks implication that wasn't necessarily what they were thinking of when they did it but\nI'll just use the names John and Mary Okay John and Mary weren't married John and Mary had a daughter named Susie and John ... got\nDivorced so John order to make sure that Susie got all of his all of his wealth when he passed\nSo in the divorce decree he made sure that Susie was the beneficiary in his will he made Suzy the beneficiary even formed a trust to make sure that Suzy it would be the beneficiary of\nAll of his different accounts uh-huh so unfortunately John passed away and what he forgot to do was make Suzy the beneficiary of his four one K. it didn't matter what the divorce decree said it didn't matter what the trust said it didn't matter what the will said\nThe beneficiary on the four one K. was still marry the ex wife\nAnd married remarried and she was married to a guy was doing great Mary said\nI don't need the money I Want Suzie to get all the only way that Suzie could get it was for married a cash it in it was a three hundred thousand dollar four one K. wow\nAnd they had to take about a fifty percent tax it on that [noise] so Suzie only got about a hundred and fifty thousand of it\nSo it it's a good lesson for everybody that make sure you're beneficiaries are listed not just in the will end in divorce decrees and trust and things like that but make sure the beneficiaries are correct on your investment accounts on your for one k.'s and so forth because that supersedes everything\nAnd had they even had Suzie as the contingent beneficiary on that four one K. what a role to her but unfortunately she only got half of what she would have gotten and uh gosh there were so many things that was that was a terrible situation they came to me after that had happened and\nBut that would certainly be something that I Would make sure want everybody to be aware of it's a bad tax mistake to make sure you don't have those beneficiaries lifted correctly\nWow that is a costly blender there that's for sure and let me ask you one more question here about taxes and retirement\nOr tell us your story if you would about attacks planning strategy that you've used in the past to make a significant difference in one individuals retirement plan\nWell there are people that are fortunate enough to have saved well\nThat when they get to the age of seven and a half and they've got qualified funds are as four one K. is et cetera\nThe government is going to start forcing them to take that money out ... every once in a while somebody will come along\nThat sits down with us and they'll say gosh I just don't need that income I've got an income coming from other sources and and so what we do is we we do in a required minimum distribution strategy and it's always best we can start this before they get to Seventy and a half but in this case the gentleman\nDid not need is required minimum distributions out of his four one K. and so we were able to do was we were able to utilize the strategy where we funded an insurance policy with those proceeds\nAnd he used that to\nPosition for a future income if you needed it but also to provide a long term care benefit and most importantly for him which was his goal a death benefit he was able to take those funds that he didn't need put it in a life insurance policy leverage it\nInto substantially greater than he would do on a putting in a C. D. or anything like that because he's going to be able to leave a lot more tax free wealth to his beneficiaries by virtue of\nFinding a life insurance policy with those funds he didn't eat we took it a step further with him and that life insurance policy is owned by trust so that gives him a lot lot more control shortly after he passes as to how the money is used\nCertainly a lot of things to talk about when it comes to taxes and specifically taxes in retirement and I know there are lots of people out there who have liked to have that conversation with your mark or what happens when they come to see you\nWell when they come in we want to just sit down and get to know what I have a discovery session and if they're willing to make a contribution to save shelter they can either go on line to save shelter dot org where we work very closely with them it's domestic violence awareness month\nSo what we'll do is we'll match any kind of donations and they make whatever is on their heart or whatever that they can do we just ask them that they can get five dollars or ten dollars it goes to a great call Cheryl branch does a wonderful job is executive director over there and we'll sit down with them explore all of the\nAreas where retirees and pre retirees need to be\nAware and have examined like how much do they pay in and see what are the tax implications of their investments\nWhat's the risk of their portfolio right now are they set up to where they can handle unexpected healthcare costs do they have most importantly that lifetime income plan in place\nSo folks will help to answer all those questions and we'll do a little bit of good in the community along the way so once again if you contribute anything to save sheltering to save shelter dot org or we can just bring a check and made out to save shelter will match it\nAnd we're going to donate our time and help those folks get on the right path to financial security and independence absolutely free of charge\nThank your coach our that's very nice and again mark Howard's number is eight eight eight five one one plan\nThat his eight eight eight five one one plant call that number leave your name and your contact information that's all you have to do today\nAnd then you'll get a call back from march team and you can come in and have a conversation sit down face to face and talk with mark about your situation you can come into the savannah office of Eisenhower drive or their neighborhood offices throughout the low country doesn't matter where you live in the area certainly mark Howard can help you Howard", "show_name": "The Retirement Huddle with Mark Howard of Howard Financial Group", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "13"}
