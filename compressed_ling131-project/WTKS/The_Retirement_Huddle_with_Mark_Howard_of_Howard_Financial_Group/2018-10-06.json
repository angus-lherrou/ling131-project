S.\n[noise]\n[noise]\nLocal weather will be mostly sunny today look for hides in the upper eighties the low nineties mostly clear tonight with overnight lows and the upper sixties latest weather information as always available on your smartphone just download the WTO see whether I'm Ron well double duty chaos\nAnd high hard with your station now Fox News radio covers the world news radio seven points out an ad\nYou can say the name of the company has lost some weight from now on weight watchers will be known as W W\nThe company wants to focus more on overall wellness and not just dieting it's apple offer tips and meditation and get that rewards for tracking meals and exercise W.

course made the right decision in picking judge Kavanaugh and President Trump still buy Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that's another good reason to get to look at the buyout sometimes but you got away on boats and somebody that's good with retirement income clinic and actually really lay that out for you said that you can see the benefits of of each\nChoice boy a lot to think about their and another reason why you should talk to mark how worried about all this kinda stuff welcome into the retirement huddled today glad you're here mark of course the coach and he is the president of Howard financial group and we're talking about if you have a situation where you\nAre forced into retirement or at least you're offered that option what about if a person comes in to you mark and says if I have the option of taking my severance as a one time payment or a payout over several months which one should choose how would you advise them\nOnce again that separates as at one time payment or a payout it's going to really depend on the individual situation I had a very good friend and the client except one from CNN and it paid him out over a year\nAnd the problem with that is that he didn't jump right\nBack out into the workforce he actually utilize that just to kind of take his time and play a little bit and what ends up happening is what you try to get back into the workforce the new employees that are looking at your resume might have issues with too much time out of the workplace yeah so I think he just got to be careful of that but at the same time\nOnce again it depends on your financial situation and whether you need that lump sum whether you might want to have some money start working for you and utilize it\nAs a kind of a deferred income type strategy or whether you can actually afford to take it out over a couple of months in ... and obviously can be utilized it as kind of a discipline so to speak so that you're getting an income stream for a few months instead of getting that lump sum and you know some people do have a tendency to want to go to Tahiti or blow it\n[laughter] well you know and this also goes back to the old adage of you know it's easier to find a job when you already have one than it is if you're unemployed and you know it kinda comes into play there as well\nShould I find another job or just tried to retire altogether and try to make it work I Would imagine that question you really couldn't answer into you knew more about their situation exactly and\nBoy they do not need to retire altogether and just try to make it work that plan has got to be in place so I Would just say you know once again the temptation is you've got to get back out in the workforce\nSo much of the time you want to make sure that when you're being offered these types of of buyouts you're already out there looking you're already starting to set up a plan some kind of a transition plan but yeah just to decide to retire all of a sudden typically that's not going to be a very good idea unless you've really done a good job of saving\nAre marquee kind of touched on this a little earlier you and you're likely to be somewhat older if you're being offered some kind of retirement package or\nBeing given an opportunity to retire a little earlier than you plan but well I have trouble getting hired by somebody else at this age and the answer to that question I fake is yeah you probably will\nYeah it's a tough job market for anybody over fifty and for anybody to say the term ages them\nIt's a reality ages and it's just the fact is is is there's a stereotype folks that are over fifty and it's just a tough job market for anybody over fifty so some things that you gotta do you can't hide your age but you can work around those stereotypes the stereotypes that employers have older workers\nAnd some of the things that you can do just showed that you're still out there learning that you're on the cutting edge of your field\nYou know keep go into those conferences and serving on panels that seminars writing articles\nAnd so many people that I've seen don't have\nA link in profile you know get your linked in profile set up a profile on these different business networks you know if you don't have a linked in profile employers just going to assume you're you're lacking in technology skills\nAnd then the other thing is I've seen a lot of my clients that have go had been forced to this transition they've said they've had a lot of luck with applying the smaller companies that get\nFewer resumes than larger employer so to try to trying to get back into one of those large corporations those smaller companies you might have to accept less pay\nAnd don't offer to take a pay cut right off the bat but you know you don't want to say I'm desperate but at the same time you can a lotta times get your resume noticed a heck of a lot faster if it's with a smaller company where there's not going to be so many resumes that they're filtering through\nWell a lot of things to think about here and certainly incentive to come in and have a conversation with mark coward mark what do you have to offer those folks who might be facing that situation and would like to come in and talk with you\nWell run as you know our company we've been blessed and we're really passionate about our community and we just want to make sure that folks in

unfortunately my hair turned loose [laughter] as I began to lose more and more\nThe longer it was the worst it look so I just I had to begin shaving it down and you know so I I shaved my head if

retirement huddle with a one and only\nMark Howard to the president of Howard financial group and wherever you live you live in Savannah Hilton Head anywhere in the country\nYou can come into marks

for an opportunity for you to get to know him\nAnd all you gotta do is call this number to start that plan in motion eight eight eight five one one plan that his eight eight eight five one one plan you can get to know mark he can get to know you and that's a really important part\nYou can put together a custom plan for your retirement years eight eight eight five one one plan is your number to call\nI bet you haven't done a multiple choice quiz and a long time since you were in school years ago but I got one for you hear some of those are great and some of these questions may lead to a good discussion here at what age should\nPeople start saving for retirement a when you start working be\nAfter you buy your first home or see when you paid off all your deaths what's the answer that question\nI'm a firm believer as soon as you begin working whatever kind of retirement plan that they offer it work take advantage of it\nAnd here's why Albert Einstein said it best he said compound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time\nThat compounding interest that you want to start taking advantage of from the very get go I tell people when they\nWhen they are planning to save for college start a savings plan when the baby's conceive why wait nine months when you get a jump on the right\nIn other words that compounding is huge in compounding just takes your working money and transforms it and it becomes a powerful income generating tool for the future so\nThat's the key time discipline patients that sweat grows well but you don't want to wait until after you bought your home and you don't want to wait until after you've paid off your debts start right away when you start working\nSo it was a ship people start saving for retirement the correct answer is hey when you ... why not\nNumber two question here yes which of these are the best estimate of how much income you're going to need in retirement a fifty percent of your current income me eighty five percent of your current income see one\nHundred percent of your current income or D none of the above\nWell this is an interesting question because most financial advisors in the past have calculated retirement on about eighty percent or eighty five percent of what what people are are currently earning\nPersonally we like to work off a hundred percent so I Would say see and the reason is because there's so many unknowns in retirement\nWe break it down into essential and non essential needs an essential of course is gonna be your ... your house and and hopefully you got your house paid off but you know all of the different things every month that you're going to have to pay the non essential is separated from that and I believe\nThat essential those essential things that you pay every month\nShould be covered by guaranteed stream of income you can't outlive the inflation protected you don't want your retirement income to take a hit\nAnd that's an acronym for health care I for inflation tea for taxes so we want to set that thing up to where especially since people are living longer why not let's set the goal for a hundred percent of current income that way you can travel and enjoy life\nAnd maybe we can even set it up were so scared is just to play check instead of a paycheck\nAll right let's move on to that question here which of ease market do you find that retirees fear the most a not leaving enough to the kids be running out of money or see nursing home care\nRunning out of money is what we see over and over and that's the overriding financial concern that just about everybody shares in retirement and some people come in and they say yeah if there's some left to go to the kids that'd be great\nA close second that I Will I Will tell you that Iran is needing nursing home care that has been something that has really\nReally shook a lot of retirements or and or things like Alzheimer's or dementia these long term type chronic illnesses and really drain savings\nBut as we are living longer running out of money is the one that we see over and over and survey after survey shows is the one that retirees fairly most\nOkay Number four which of these examples best represents is our first spied retirement plan and we talked about diversification overtime and how important that has\nA a mix of sixty present stocks and forty percent bonds me three rental homes in different neighborhoods along with a significant amount of cash into bank see ten to twelve different mutual funds or D none of the above\nWell diversification is an interesting thing and it was in the wall street machine want you to believe that if you have your portfolio spread out into those three that you mentioned stocks and bonds and real estate and mutual funds your diversified your properly diversified\nWell that portfolio right there would have lost about forty five percent in two thousand two thousand nine so does that sound like true diversification we believe that true diversification is having some of your money in a vehicle\nOr if the market goes down it doesn't hurt you in that vehicle and there are wonderful vehicles out there to do that and that's one of the ways you build a retirement program is you truly diversified parts of that portfolio to make sure that it's it's going to perform in the best of times of the worst of times especially if you have a market correction\nOkay last question for you here this is a multiple choice quiz folks and are much doing a great job of answering all these questions and there's some ridiculous answers and you're too but number five to make sure you don't run out of money in retirement only withdraw blank percent from your portfolio\nEach year a one percent be four percent see six percent or D find a different strategy altogether what's your answer to that\nWell I'll share with your story we had a very nice gentleman named Bob come to one of our dinner events and we show a picture of the stock market and the stock market's performance over the last Twenty years starting in about Nineteen Ninety eight and he came up to me afterwards and he said ...", "show_name": "The
