Ninety seven points out of hand twelve Ninety am telling you [noise]\nThe law marginal legal had vice Justin welcome to handling the law [noise]\n[noise] no I'm a quick question um I have a in a car and then my rent a car\nCompany um they didn't have a personal injury I my question is the correct in the car and then have the record company follow in a in\nA claim from the other party or didn't bother me pick out of it\nI didn't understand one word of that so let me go through from the beginning right you rent a car\nYou want to extend the rental period correct yeah\nOkay no problem there but was there was an accident\nSomewhere in there yeah because I got America because of an accident\nOh you have to extend your rental car because of the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nSo my question is um the other part of my insurance is paying for up to thirty days if you earn thirty days\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages\nAnd there is a and if the damages run that unique forty five days for example to repair your car they just pay for it but that's what happened to me I'll get my car had the effect that we'd be replaced and since it's a beamer three quarters of the parties had to come in from Germany on a ship\nAnd so it was almost two and a half months and do you know the other side just coughed up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days\nAfter I don't want to do what I mean I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice as the other side is going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is this is my question why my inner part of the companies have filed a leading just like what am I prefer well with my attorney\nBecause you know because they have because they have nothing to do is follow lean why the other it's they have nothing to do on the other insurance company that's paying you\nHas nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is it's your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with the ... companies that will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so now there's no place you can go but the good data so you have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I said two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long and then uh I think with State Farm insurance which the other drivers are insurance companies they didn't quibble didn't quibble I mean there are adjuster went out saw what was going on understood and just wrote the check\nAnd let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing a a beamer which is why I'm probably going to give up my beamer\nAh because I just I mean everything costs a fortune on that car I mean crazy John Hi John welcome hey how ya doing yes or on a good\nRestaurant from the older\nAbout six years ago in orange county and um\nI picked it up got going eventually you know grab a war

dollars down maybe the balance I mean all within thirty days or you lose your deposit\nHe wanted to verify that I had the right to tell my interest because it was like a four Plex and a strip mall okay\nAnd and uh he called the older which he should have done the owners say oh no you can't tell you this is the answer is I owned a property\nOkay boy ... hold on hold on that's that's a bunch of BS you can't sell your interests to someone else is there you have a lease correct\nYes All right ... ... is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the rights to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well they have to okay you\nKnow then you're finding this guy's crazy then if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh man do you

John ... there's no question the owner to them any right to do that you should have gotten a ... you should have gotten she should have gotten a lawyer the minute you were locked out the minute he said no\nThat moment in the late no I don't think so\nUh so I mean there was going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be the the issue is going to be damages\nOkay that's the way I Would do it makes sense to me I pay child support my kids are twenty three\nI'll be paying child support for the rest of their lives and I'm not even

landlord\n... dollar now or you have a couple of choices are technically you have to pay the full rent and then\nThe a landlord I has the ability has legal rights then do walk through and assuming there is no damages than right she was seven hundred and fifty dollar check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a landlord cannot use the uh the deposit towards the ...\nThis month's rent and if a places and reasonable shape it should be OK depending on what a bastard the landlord has

news yeah thank you [laughter] that's what I'm looking out for my money my grandmother\nAnd my ... my grandmother now incapacitated at home that they want to put me and my brother on at the ...\nWho was that what your parents and there are still alive yeah okay and it's so I'm assuming it's a remarkable trust your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct yeah OK\nWhile they're doing they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know you have if they ever have to go to the home that the government because they have so much money can come back she's getting paid for it because she's on Medicare they're saying that that government can come and try and take the money\nNo unless she is she had been is uh she had been a fishery of uh the uh the narrowest\nVeterans with regards to my parents and something what's happened to my parents and they were going to go home and ... yeah and they're saying that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be in your vocal trust\nWhere you're going to [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust the set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go\nOn I think not Medicare uh and uh you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole and pay for for example a\nHome or to live for folks living with a million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now [laughter] oh yeah like\nI said I've got to cut Fifteen thousand dollars\nTo do that to what to change a judge to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name\nBut I Know that's great anybody's charge you Fifteen thousand or so that is crazy you know yeah you'd be crazy for that time to find yeah go trying to find another way are okay you got from on your website ah yeah yeah I got tons of them handling ... trust in a state lawyers times they're not going to charge you Fifteen thousand dollars and if they do I'm getting twelve thousand of that\nThat's why I'm looking out for my money\nGo for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making it ate irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nAs the high asked me\nHow you doing yeah yes ma'am well can I Do for you\nA coupon question for you I keep it short I\nAm looking for the most and um I guess the new thing now is my cat I have to pay rent also monthly\nWaves are you where they want to wait your cats have to pay rent monthly\nCharge 'em you know there's a deposit oh yeah of course at yes I Know plus it's thirty five eight ... thirty five per cat forty five ... dog car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my cats are certified service animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed they won't get into that but the animal ... um [noise]\nI can I waive the\nOther side that is a good question and work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if the paperwork\nUh yeah yeah well what if you have five cats and they're all service animals you probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I don't know that don't know but for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is that you for one service animal and ... it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a city in motion support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for an emotional such\nA low yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't they\n[laughter] yeah yeah they're not that\nNow I understand right to someone wants to ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I should probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if H I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies

to figure out how to get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] she had good luck alright I'll just tell me what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years into the least they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought their car and not\nAnd then when I went in front of them on it and they appraise the car and we out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\nOr they will give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my email to specify especially [noise] definitely says this away races are paired up are you up to a hundred percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value ... you got him on that All right there's no question that this was what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or do they say they're just not about not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company deals to show me the car two years early\nRight in are they not recognizing the car max appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nSo there are came higher than ... oh my God okay so\nSo so they ... they print it out to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about the hundred ten percent and the guy will I don't know nothing about that she brought the manager out I gave him the document and email and he goes okay\nWe'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your car I mean your carpet showing condition it was ten thousand miles under what the mileage should have been for a two year early on at least that time and he goes it will give you the deal but you need to buy one our cars and I and I go at a highlight it and I think I'd go but it says yo by micro no matter what buyers or not and he says\nWell and they they just stumbled on themselves\nRight well I didn't get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though there are a bunch of lines come\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the ... my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand dollars a year in my car sits in the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I was just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered that they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they're listening to you yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and that well here's here's\nWhere I figured out the ... because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I ... I had it uh you can sell the car I to anybody else at whatever the value is in the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nWell the problem was with her\n... percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what the hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know taking a bigger hit so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so what we do it on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they weren't going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right oh okay ah but you [noise]\nWow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... ah the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent I so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court\nBut that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand a word of it so ah that works out now isn't it\n... you can't ... when it comes to math\nBeyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr a hundred and wide to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy\nHi Tammy yes good morning do yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners or on a property and I had done paying\nThe property taxes for several years I have a record can I put a link\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you get what you can do as soon as the other ones for their ... to share", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Handel", "city": "Savannah", "day": "07"}
