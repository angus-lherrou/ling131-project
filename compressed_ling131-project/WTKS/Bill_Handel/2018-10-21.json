on the law alright Laura hello Laura\nHi yeah I've been I was employed two and a half years and I had exceptional work ethic and performance and my boss discriminated against me and my religion and political affiliation\nI how well first of all are your what is your religion\n[noise] Christian okay and I'm assuming you're not a wild ... liberal is that fair to say he is I got it and you're not [laughter] yeah but I kept to myself okay so fanatic All right so a discrimination is ah how ah was shown to you\n[noise] um she made a comment in front of a couple of other she hates Christians\nOkay now ... that's all she did she say she hate Christian where you fired where you've demoted or were you held back from promotion or is it just she hates Christian\nShe lock men so I couldn't transfer out I've heard of it and then a lemonade that my position [noise]\nWow [noise] yeah okay it's protected by her by her good friend\nAh who is no doubt or the head of Muslim or a Jew or or [laughter] or somewhat of that ilk yeah here's here's the problem you have\nIs uh that I mean I'm ... on his face it looks like it is straight out discrimination show there doesn't seem to be a\nA lot of a lot of doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and uh your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot\nOf a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company that had a and it's a company that is in it's in the spotlight I mean people know about this company and there was an issue a day\nAnd African American who was working there and I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two or three people\nWhat they did is they just shut down the entire division and that I literally and said everybody everybody in the division is a shutdown we decided to shut down the division and boom where are you going to go with that or you shut down the division because you are a bunch of racist I Know we\nShut down the division as a as a business decision you see that's the problem that uh you're up against\nAt my performance for better than the three repaired but together but that's what you say that I have proof that\nBut he but even so as I say I division part is going to be a horrible also because your performance used to be wonderful doesn't mean that she's going to say that you are in subordinate I she doesn't judge said that the ... it has changed I mean those are very very hard cases uh Laura how how's your Hebrew\n[laughter] for um oh I see I work on that a lot truly [laughter]\nAll right Laura that yeah I mean it's it used to be where discrimination was\nIt was it was in a dead bang when or if you could prove discrimination the court has actually gone the other way in California which was a shocker to me when I heard about the court and because I and also firing someone you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here is\nA you know what I Want to fire you today I'm your boss I just don't like any more boom you're gone with no rights\nSo\nUh it gets to be a problem to say the least alright Joe here you go Joel welcome Hey Joe\nHi I'm a Seventeen year old disabled but I have some serious disability and I'm I'm having problems H oh\nWhat a shock when\nI Want to put a window in the bathroom in the last ... [noise]\nSo I called the management company you buck Fifteen times they never called back where it got a chance to talk to you on hold and trying to get a supervisor the board of directors are going to try to go to one of their meetings but and it put out flyers saying when the meeting with the but they never put out of the time\nSo I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when\n... or ... they said the CDC in ours um rent we having a window because of the zero why why so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty person with a million and go back [noise]\nUm [noise] so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding you now or is it just is screaming at you\nKnow the funny me a hundred dollars a month or so of course makes something art and they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming that demanding I checked the window out or else they would keep fighting\nAlright has anybody else in the building or put windows in in those locations\nNot throwing All right so this is new\nWell I it's they have the right to say no or a they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours\nOr they can say ... and you take it out until you are an getting here's your fine and uh we're gonna keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is and they're ... by the way that there's the court case\nYeah but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer or to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here are based on what you said because you know you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea\nI'll make a fraud and the company but it's a superior court action a ... at this point uh I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court have dismissed ... lawyer actually gives a damn and views you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent guy\nBut sometimes not but that's worth a shot just a lot of snow there is no\nNo there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house\nThe allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true but it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor\nAnd started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked\nTo get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to see a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I wasn't then I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do when I'm thirty days you have to file a response and you need some help with that on the other but that that avid attorney I could just you don't do that\nYourself you write well actually I go to a paralegal and because you want to put some of the ... yeah you want to just there are some legal language that you have to know now you can go on the Internet and do your own research ah that talks about the fences and there are affirmative defense is but uh it's yeah you can do it yourself\nOr with a little bit of research I absolutely Lorraine Hi Lorraine welcome to handle on law\nI fail yes I took my car on this noise in my car and ethics lawyer they fix my brakes which were perfect when I took the car and\nDriver Kay sure ah you have a case and that you have to pay for\nAll right ah yeah\nFigure out first of all you want the money back for what you paid for and that's it that's all you're gonna get a fact that they didn't fix a the noise or you're still the same place with a noisy car and it could be the battery and you're hearing aid is going south and you're hearing rattling noises and uh I have no idea how that works\nBrian Hi Brian welcome they\nWanted to ask you a for years whenever I see my dentist he's trying to uh\nTalked me into installing a bridge on a a I have an open more that I've been chewing on for ten years no no uh no problems we've been trying to talk me into installing a bridge on their thing and it was a piece of cake\nSo three and a half weeks ago I allowed him to do a cursory thirty five hundred dollars and part of that preparation for bridge is you're going down to write\nTwo teeth on Ah yes I have one that I've\nBeen in structured and calling for three and a half we thought it was settled down it didn't [laughter] I've been on I'd be proven it hundred milligrams twenty four hours a day for almost a month now he sent me to an end though Don this\nYesterday and uh he says that I'm going to need to root canal grounded proved them too much for the hope is almost to the store\nOr that's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response of uh my original Dennis responses is just one of those things happen\nOut now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for abridged today when they're dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice ah but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take 'em for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice worth\nA but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things would happen this is malpractice on its face\nAnd then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in pursuing\nYour fingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars a year go ahead and there was no problem and go to small claims court and then the problem is going to be you'd have to bring a dentist in there\nYou're gonna ... you're going to have to bring in a dentist a dental a dentist who is going to be a witness because he's going to say in my professional opinion this is one of those things that are just went south and he's within the that is you are within that tiny little percentage that no matter what job I Do it's going to go south okay and then I\nLet her be be appropriate being done yeah\nMaybe or bring in lots of them are bringing in two or three and then see what the judge has to say OK okay alright try yeah tennis is he spent all these years talking\nYou into doing something went in in ... when you when you look at a dentist hockey when to anything you go to a dentist when you need a dentist\nI Know you've probably heard by now the new hack or Facebook actually Facebook\nHas had to ... within a couple of weeks of each

[noise]\nAnd it was it was radio covers the world\nAn eighty year old money\nOkay let's go ahead and uh take some phone calls I hello Greg\nWill answer the\nQuestion concerning the ability of a person to decline a portion of an urgent specifically my father has a timeshare if he leaves it to me can I say yes to the rest of the inheritance but noted that sure and what would I fish on the record\nI don't think so you can do you do it I mean there's nothing in the world I mean how can you be forced to accept property and in the case in a case of a A N good for you by the way of saying no in the case of a time share that's not property that's a liability\n... that that's what it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee as they please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an owner of this property do whatever the hell you want with it but uh I'm done\nAnd could they go back again to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but they're not going to they're not going to see if they're not going to sue the state uh it's they're going to walk away from it such a thank you very much\nOkay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract a state does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trustee would have negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he's still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop the estate from being distributed because it has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away and that's it you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nHas for starters especially now with tied shares because there are no longer you know on her own the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts of to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there it is there's a deed you own property\nNow they just give you points you all nothing what you own is a contract in perpetuity where\nThey have the right to raise maintenance fees every year every three years or whatever the contract says forever\n\nAnd inevitably does anybody actually use time shares once in awhile I run across someone that yeah loves the time share and yes thought it was the greatest deal but that's one out of all\nFifty maybe alright Eddie Hi any\nGoing on over ... sure um\nMy wife and I broke our ... our landlord to live in um New York long story short ... hundred dollar of our deposit\nBecause I'm an Oscar winning done one of my little loving it started to leave 'em mouthwash bottle on the counter and uh apparently a lab or what they call a chemical burn a little ring from the mouthwash bottle um\nUm my my my argument is yeah there was a male rock bottom Jonah\nLet the little room there you know how is that our that our fault\nYeah which ... which are arguing that wear and tear effectively\nThat swearing and and what an outside the use of the Keller account or was it for the Melbourne yeah okay fair enough so what's your question my\nQuestion is he's keeping Fifteen hundred dollar kinda running down it All right what's your question um how do I get my yard bucks that you're doing the right\nTo it yeah I think so based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if a ... it's not ... susceptible\nOr it is susceptible to a ring around the counter 'em all based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash\nOn the counter\nWhat ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material and are there are now I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of these a marble yards these rock ... yards or counter or manufacturers put encounters there is Pacific Lee or anti mouthwash counters that you know that\nNo no I didn't hear there and there it is an time mouthwash counters I just made that up so [laughter] uh\nSo it seems to me that the argument is normal wear and tear the tenant is never responsible for normal wear and tear and you're going to argue that what you did it for the mouthwash a bottle in their shots like everybody else does and that's your problem and you're still in the small claims court for the Fifteen hundred dollars not that complicated and if I'm a judge I'm going to give it to you\nVery good mind trying yeah now do you think it'd be easier to go after him or to go after via the mouthwash company\nOh please ... ...\nYeah go after Proctor and gamble okay do me a favor [laughter] I said they're mouthwash is so acidic it goes through counters and see what their lawyers are going to say\nI really like a stupid that's out it wasn't actually well you're absolutely right now I couldn't agree with you more so I didn't have to say how stupid that was the lead me to the punch good for him but [noise]

I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark 'cause you don't have the have the proof not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just too is just too easy to uh attack you on this one so argue that feeds you obviously you tell the collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell him to sue you and uh then you have to defend yourself in a small claims who probably\nAnd uh then you have to worry about your credit being dangerous ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked or\nProbably ... park right yeah probably will you're gonna mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean half the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them negotiate say I'll give you half the money now\nAnd but the thing is I I mean it for money more than anybody I'd rather give him the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pound sand or you look at your credit you've got your choices none of them very good unfortunately\nI'm not a good place to me sometimes and I often say this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer\nAnd quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no right it's very clean the jury determines yes or the judge determines here's the statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff I loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean\nOne is too loud it's just a sloppy way of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the to answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not me\nThere you go silver lining every moment\nOkay\nOr Alexander Hi Alexander\nHome here yes there are we going to do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judge back this up here at our receive a cat's always ended up that from the IRS showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay way to say I view oh hold on are you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're you're a single so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYes okay\nSo the IRS is now saying you will or you were given this much\nDebt and uh and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't do they sue you or they just wrote it off\nThe original credit card company\nI owe Fifteen I understand that they write it off or I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so\nThat means you are now that means you were sued okay\nAll right and so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgiveness of deadly\nLet me tell you the whole story okay so you can follow it a little bit better\nBe original that fifty nine hundred\nI received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company\nAfter giving up years later that the IRS\nYeah no I understand since the IRS ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nThe lights on for the amount that they said I ah you said Nineteen thousand dollars the original that fifty nine hundred I\nThink our eyes that they are or if a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hotter\nIt doesn't matter it does it doesn't matter I don't care that\nResidents to be our earth then reduce their from I think valve and nine hundred back the fifty nine hunter I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is Trent the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine Ninety nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally and default the point is there are no they they knew that there are no ... but they reduced to the GED\nNo not them the Ira is\nThat right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they've given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no recourse\nNow it's only been there done a statute is done\nEven though the un like the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine not not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar wherever your damages\nThe question is spent the credit card company and played at the original um\nOut yes they did four times over yes there is no records I guess the\nOnly because you have not been damaged if you want me to go out in dollars and I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying me two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no haven't you paint do thousand\nOaks oh\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Want to fight it at twenty five thousand dollars just because the patients issue good God take me for an idiot yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill\nLet me explain how this works I got it let me explain again I got it no no I I Want you to give some background I haven't\n[noise] thank you
