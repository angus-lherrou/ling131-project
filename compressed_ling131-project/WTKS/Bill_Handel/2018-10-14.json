time share body back\nOkay how much money do you will\nUh oh I don't know anything at All right I told them about that in ...\nAll right so you pay that and you're what you're saying you could've negotiated yourself and you don't think they did much right yeah so I have any recourse oh yeah you consume small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lapse\nAnd you come away I requested documentation that me and they will they will as soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims court for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they are going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing\nAnd they're saying or you don't deserve any money back because we did something in your question is okay let's see it\nAnd if they didn't do anything I mean ah their letters negotiations but if they they did or didn't do as you said I Can't imagine you're not going to get your seven thousand dollars back okay small claims court but yeah the right absolutely why did you get into a time share in the first place\nBecause I was an idiot guys very well sad die you beat me to it well said my man Hi Patty\n[noise] if you're a young lady yes ma'am I'm for me\nUm I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years\nUm I'm part time actually it's a lesson part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm I'm getting ready to retire when I have taken on days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally I've taken a few and and put them on the book the sick days [laughter] but um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nTrain them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement and looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nOn the same because I Am part time work to less than twenty hours on it so what's your question do I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the\nPolicy of the school board and the policy in which you hired is that people were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school board some companies allow people to take sick days my police departments for example usually do\nSo you've got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies and saying oh for example uh my my company to send in for surrogate parenting\nIts use it or lose it same thing uh I work for this radio station it to use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had 'cause I'm cars that if I took a different um government job that was over twenty hours when I mean whatever the policy is yeah then it could cause it stays with me I guess\nOkay but it's whatever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a policy that says use it or lose it yeah that was which I Do and not only do I have it in my company uh but I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed you know I I'd say congratulations a there is no case here\nAh you know Nick [noise] ... ah I'm renting this class and they got a new property management company and\nSo are they wrote the rules and all that good stuff I'm supposed to sign for the for the complex or we're going to be responsible for plumbing bills were found negligent and whatever plumbing issues and our\nBuildings kind of notorious for having horrible climbing so I just found that interesting [noise] um [noise] if this turns into like a big problem in the future or something I could take my landlord too small claims court about\nMaybe like uh the first thing you're going to argue is you're not responsible\nNegligent or what does that mean I don't know is it what can you do that would cause the plumbing issue rather than block up a toilet for example were ah I don't even know the mad block sink or a toilet done what pipes undoing he's a soldering on just unraveling so I don't quite get it\nAnd that did you sign the agreement with a new company\nKnow how to find that's too bad and you say no thank you I'm not saying I'm not accepting this\n... ... leasing agreement or a
