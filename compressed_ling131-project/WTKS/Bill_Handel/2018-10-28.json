worst I've had better I mean I Wish an alien or two were thrown in that story I kinda like you know with the woman foil hat so they can't read your thoughts and I'd like to see the FBI not investigating but short clean your house or because you're selling secrets of the Chinese that's a good one too\nAll right ah Hi rose rose you're up welcome [noise] yes ma'am okay Simon with um my boyfriend\nFor ten years he hasn't done that and then ten years he's finally getting its act together and if I may I Am I responsible for that\nBut first of all let's start with I don't know why would you marry someone who is such an auditor flake that he hasn't filed taxes for ten years\nWhile he pays taxes he could have an effect\nTo how we keep ... just write the check to the IRS like no no\nNo I mean taxes come out of the ... nothing like that he does all that I just had to file that site\nYeah he's probably entitled to some big refunds actually think\nUp until maybe but I'm just wondering if I marry him and my responsible\nOr how you're only responsible for being stupid and ... yeah well that's a given but I Know I mentioned person and I love you and I'm not\nEither she ... the ... well we can have that conversation\nCan we are because ah did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues just keep everything separate everything separate and and and what I mean separate is everybody has totally separate bank account and you have\nWell and so I guess that couldn't expect\nOh that's another thing suing the VA Willie oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing called contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about which I rarely do All right go for it\nSam Hi Sam Europe [noise] yes [noise] [noise] hello Sam yes yes we're going to do for you Sam ... morning how are you sir\nI could do a couple of years ago I found that was quite as my wife she is she's like the gum running and I'm from the need for them to me\nThat is of course I Do five calls later\nYes go ahead anyway I have a car loan um didn't begin bankruptcy and if I call them did he take it a kind of way\nYeah and that if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed on how much money do still on the car\nWith how much\nYou owe three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nAs maybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want [noise] oh okay\nI don't worry about it that that part is and that's usually the case is I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation the splits up the assets but cars are almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions when you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there was alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance the car well the second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much\nA left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I hold on like you know yes you're going out\nBecause of all the other cat ... case was that's that's a it's a it's a disservice because a lot of the ...\nThe problem is that the\nI ... that a county or a\nStatute of limitations\nAll right hold on wait wait wait wait Mike did uh did you file a lawsuit was filed a lawsuit filed against you\nI thought the last ... okay and it was dismissed off that for the fall off the cuff go okay for\nA ... a compact it the first time I went through a ... ... ... ... s a day to six months to come because they do a lot of them ... ... what the issue or\nThe ... did you lose on the statute of limitations\nAre out there who are we didn't get to court for them to a total the long hair and all that of course if they don't have a judge it matches\nShow about a a statute of limitations uh the first of all\nTime Mike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond what what they show is about uh you have a bankruptcy issue yeah but this man that Sonia dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice\nThere was some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues a with a statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact\nA as civil attorney on that just go to the website 'cause I Know the story was going to go on forever and frankly I didn't understand Ninety percent what you're saying anyway\nWhy any high any Europe welcome to handle on law\nAnd do yes I have a question here I had a lot in my motor home or ... it was on the recall I contacted Michelin said OK yeah recall sort of the bill a check at the top the bill for another two to three weeks\nOh wait wait wait hold on a minute ah there you had a recall and what happened and then Michelin just call you up and send us the bill for what what happened\nWhat happened the tire blowing out a chore it made a thousand dollars damage to the phone call\nI got it so the tire blew out and it was a recall tire\nThat I thought about and I never got a note it's\nGot it okay and so are you I'm eight thousand dollar damage and what else\nAnd so with the darn thing I\nActually my chest they thought I had a heart attack but ... the way they ...\nWith what\nWith the with the with the steering wheel\nTrial I see as you were ... this happened during the course of an accident when the tire blowout\nYeah sure got it so there were A Guided bodily damage bodily injury okay now what yeah\nSo am I question that I got in contact with them all the time and everything I told the guy uh I Can't get you to be another four or five weeks or whatever that number was okay\nI thought look I I'm On Medicare and you know they pay for everything right All right trying to portray it I said if you pay me ... ... feet from doing its part about that and so my question is should I get an attorney to hell with upset me dealing with this man\nWell it depends on how serious your medical issue is\nA ... but I think that the dollar\nConsidered talking to an attorney Betty okay\nThat there's enough money there that you want at least talk to a personal injury attorney yeah this is not one of those things where uh here's the medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a first of all I think you're going to have a hard time even here arguing the medical bill because he's going to come back\nAnd this is typically what happens with the ... and this is the insurance company of Michelin right this was not Michelin per se ... percent\nOh yeah you know I don't believe me you're you just started talking to them or if you're on your own or missiles going to go they're not going to ... that the guy that you're talking to is not going to write you a check for medical is going to go to their insurance company who is going to go through the medical\nAnd figure out what was legitimate what wasn't and gee you didn't have to go there and you didn't have to do this kind of procedure oh Edie Edie yeah\nGo you have talked to earlier about this [noise] okay do you need a medical malpractice attorneys and it's just that simple [noise] uh this is handle on the wall\n[noise]\n\n\nNothing small and not your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nTheir partnership even\nWith ... technology advisor you'll get the bank and one on one partnership to help your business ground because of the reliable down these would end processors you can focus on what matters now getting done\nBy down to speak with an advisor [noise] eight seven seven by down [noise]\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I have kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there is ...

and visors completely free you\nGo to ... dot com boy download them ... to get started\nWhat's going on what the answer what they're making more money bring your own back like everybody else sides yeah yeah it's now I'm Sorry it was so I understand\nBut I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that the only charge ten cents\nA and uh that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up the law that's easy I just look up the statute where they changed it and just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bad law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if there isn't a law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged sense but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nYeah\nSo we're ... the sort of you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the story I don't know what I'm saying I always bring their own recycle bags okay there's your answer\nOr what a big legal issue on that one isn't there\nOh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what is my lawyer charge 'em whenever I Need legal work just keep in mind or my expertise is is limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is insanely limited to a third party reproductive\nWise you know uh I was my lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some business documents are six and a quarter an hour six hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers\nSummer seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars and our senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's a principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA real high Israel I Am here yes or we're going to do for you\nAll right out faster for ten years um you know and I was a pretty good they are to the nomination\nA long story short my wife had an affair ah the nomination did not air whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the album God or lead your own house\nKelly the album God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination uh for two years I was working back and forth through email talking about getting in that it is the pastor a finally tears later I was given my termination notice however they backed dated it a day before my ten year\nWhere I Would have been backed into my pension play a lot of my church lost my wife and off like I mentioned that there might just rude\nAlright well first of all I did what denomination\nIs a a Methodist I'm Sorry free method is yes you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming would say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nYou if you don't like I Love that because you know what the uh you know when people call them is the honest Jews are people that believe in Christ\nWhat's that Christians that's all we call them\nThey're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out always a pleasure talking about that uh where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension\nBecause uh that was knocking you off one day a is retaliatory and its creditors or a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of pastors they really are to do that well yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely and now the issue of uh their belief that you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house in God or which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair it's somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he signed up just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking like that just I don't like the people like God just stop people from much\nYeah All right is uh the other possibility of getting in another a person is your ah another church\nCan't funny you say that actually I was approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were still interested and uh\nKinda wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that's the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church ... what do they call that ... percent of juice a congregation\nCongregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited or with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit\nFor the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or ...

I talked to an attorney or because there was an affair and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollar is going to take an a contingency that one is a problem because if the money's gone a ... and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where it was a lawyer yet that where's the winner gets paid\nYeah so there has to be she spent the money a regime and what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe helped make if somebody said if you go to and file ... they can make make myself um I didn't say the ...\nAn executive or I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file yes court to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust in a state where I go to the website to do that because there was a lot\nOf pieces on this one for sure sunny hello sunny\n... father or in the crowd at grad school to let that or you don't have\nTo analyze itself okay with that I write and I do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably gonna need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do we help people who don't have any money\nOr it's these pro bono odds organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need that you're gonna find that out in Georgia sunny\nDay that it is that that's how they will join your\nVacation in Georgia you have to call a lawyer in Georgia we call the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\n[noise] okay Colorado law\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that are do pro bono work sunny or are you are you ... are you broke\n[laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nTo say that my mom a bill\nAnd uh this lawyer is spreading or ... or he was a it was a a lot of a combination if they loan for thousands of dollars and so when I see that I gave them they uh\nThey they're there and I asked them what do you have to stay with it said something about the Fifth Circuit and pay\nI pay for the deaths of favorite but the average out\nOkay I none of this makes sense on ... you can get the death certificate in two seconds that's that's a public record yeah you're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyers gonna take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia right\nOkay All right All right All right good luck you know so I just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are or what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't ah a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nAnd I will say you have any pencils for sale\nYeah because it's verbal ... force at all first of all the evidence of all these ... to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said OK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out to be willing to say you have to this week\nAnd to pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make it seemed writing he signs it okay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero\nAnd that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law\nAnd common law incidentally the law started\nNot as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from a it\nSays that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie okay I get you know yeah if you're on a if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm off on okay this is the bottom line I I'm going to discontinue or my insurance uh with Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy\nIs the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on me\nSure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't ... odd there is a penalty why would you give up your health insurance quickly Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that Stevie\nOkay so so really what I'm ... well the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser\nSo go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty if at all\nOkay that's simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea yeah I'm assuming it's\nNow it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would\nBe oh areas because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but the subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm right now so it's in legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation but the Republicans are trying to appeal you know they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that's introduced right now\nUh so this could take this one new ... could take years\nAnd I was going to take years but a neighbor pass but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nUm yes I had a partnership with a pickle that a lot for nine years we put down ten years ago we had a recall I filed bankruptcy personal bankruptcy a few years before so I Would label it file on this book that my partner filed bankruptcy and stuff\nBut they still come back after\nA well what kind of busy first of all let's talk about the business was it a wealthy or corporation\nForget that partnership\nA and yes they can't come after you are as a one of the partners in since you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it has it been a I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nQuite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but once that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you can be found with any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you it doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nOn it ... it was the right to record high tailed buck there's wet practical\n... and why did he go under not an ... there weren't enough customers or or a\nRobbery I got the guy had to close it down after nine years\nYou got ... kind of a neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nOr what but Marino valley huh wow why it got really bad after nine years so we get to shut it down within their credit that folk like my partner filed on up there that would have to take care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an El Al Sisi or a corporation\nOr a law now I Do I Do yeah\nOh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say\nAlthough I'm going to repeat it Dorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nAh yeah it's like a long time ago me and my girlfriend and her mother we bought a house now and we all the time\nAnd there's been a wave passes stats reputation that well that would go with my daughter turned Eighteen 'cause we have real government of and what she turned Eighteen oh go go down in um make them sell the house when I went down\nAnd to the courthouse Monday and wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering is there a any kind of way I could find out that I did sign on at how\nWell okay it says I don't quite

you all went on the loan\nOr no we didn't get along together we just put money\nThough so you just by ... by you are you outright just bought a house everybody putting an X number of dollars there was no mortgage on it right\nNow yeah they didn't find that dog but um\nI Do remember signing a and I put it like maybe it was our dog day then we find that it's only for like maybe seven hundred dollar\nYou put seven hundred dollars down on the house yeah how do you want a house was seven hundred dollars down\nNo no no don't go in his corner the down payment\nHow much was the entire downpayment\nOh not that I don't remember but didn't we find out probably think it was all like twenty nine thousand during that that was like Seventy five minutes\nA Dorsey and your name is no longer

arrested him on global called a couple of days ago told me that I ... my name and then returned all the money for our local law enforcement wouldn't be around to get them\nYeah I'm actually remember of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls or they're they're just they're just fun to return now normally a\nYeah of course it's a scam and no they can't do it and they are in violation of the law and here is the problem you call the authorities and whoever a is a uh whoever handles that that it would probably be the FCC I guess who is in charge of that\nAnd why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who I said I I'm with the IRS\nAnd do we have a A N and we ... a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nUh yes and we'll take a will take a check over the phone I Will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a ... card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cards apple to or I chose anyway [laughter] excuse me [noise] so\nWhat I did is I said really a IRS leaning it was absolutely a go once you give me the number of lean\nBecause what he's talking about I said there's no such thing as an Irish document that you're holding onto that\nDoesn't have the final number on it so why don't you give me the final number oh we're not allowed to do that really and so\nI just had a ball with this guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line whenever anybody ever make that kind of a a a threat you just hang up on it I mean it's going to replace why doctors for your\nTime okay All right yeah it's just what robocalls when I just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them manage this whole thing about how I hate people in the hate me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day\nAnd I were talking about robo calls that I mean it was I was stunned because I I you know if you you\nCan easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look at it and thinking you're in your mind because normally or you think is is this going is this a robocall once you even ask that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\n... Mr handle and this is a call\nMr handle and no one was on the other end except some computer I'm Mr handle my name is whatever for a collection agency and then I hear a ... as you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my head piece sorry about that uh oh here we go I have my hippies back on again it was a robocall\nThey got me they got me I did not\nKnow for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go she was me\nI didn't hear you and then I started screaming\nYou stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least of what I was calling a ... of course they don't have a program to answer that but it was great fun out robocalls but no the bottom line is if you ... the IRS never makes the phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do what we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times use the magic word harassment\nOh so you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on the phone call you stay on the phone with me you're allowing me to record the phone call\nClick\nUnless it is a legitimate collection agency where they're following all the rules say absolutely no problem no problem you're recording\n[noise] do you all the money [noise] and okay [noise] so much for that [noise] ah this\nIs a handle on the wall\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.

wanted to tell you that OK okay\nGo in any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe and I'm\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise]\nSo we went to emergency and they had to cut part of her male off but it was infected do the pedicure [noise] so we gave her medication antibiotics they stay off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work\nThe next day it didn't it didn't and got it got worse so we had to go back to the emergency pave our mother copayments\nAnd er then they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor so the next day she and her doctor the doctor said I Can't do it I mean to send you to pressure so she was off work before they couldn't see the specialist or the following week again she missed like six seven days\nBy a car we seen the specialist it got worse but at the removed home now [noise]\nAnd she couldn't go to work again\nSo she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world is going to pick it up and read a missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's\nNothing there and so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the person the other side of that if I'm being sued and I run the ... a shopping and go hey wasn't me that the infections\nSomeplace else so I it's one of those and also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we ever thought of of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you\nCan do that although I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry uh she\nWorks part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right that's what does she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so ah she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then the whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try\nI can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has\nA probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance so the other thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and what do you wanna do you want\nMe to sue you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right yeah how how what a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShouldn't they carry insurance [laughter]\nYeah I Would think so although I don't even know what kind of in ... what kind of liability insurance\nYou have for nails I'm ... yeah they sure but so
