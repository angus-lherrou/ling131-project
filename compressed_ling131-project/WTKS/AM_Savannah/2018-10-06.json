M. J.\nFull metal jacket ... and lead romano's J. H. P. jak of the whole point I'm at the bullet wages is shame pointed out um a couple of weeks ago\nOr you have something that says gee are grains mhm uh there's two different grains or grain telling you how much the actual projectile ways and then there's a powder charge which tells you how many grain is of powder\nUm and and\nWhat you are looking for something that has the right um uh its purpose driven where there is a practice range target animal or whether it's ammunition to self defense and a shame pointed out there\nAre a different considerations there and a different design characteristics\n... a herring and recapturing a full metal jacket for target\nPractice across Los ... for example a boxer fifty rounds of nine millimeter FM Jay\nA decent quoting ammunition for the range around fourteen Ninety five fifty rounds you shot purchasing nine millimeter a whole point ammunitions or self defense because it's more complicated manufacturing process\nYou're looking at twenty or twenty five rounds on the box half as many rounds or less\nAnd they'll run anywhere from\nOh twenty dollars to twenty four Ninety five to thirty or forty dollars a box sometimes ... and one on\nOne of the things that let let's talk about the price of ammunition because it's ... gone way up over the years and and that's that's part of the anti gun culture that we've seen that honors or or state laws of said okay we may not be able to destroy the second amendment but they will charge you a hundred dollars a bullet or so like that on the price of the lead going up and that sort of thing\nYou know part of the er em some states that have laws that prohibit a lead to a project ... or ... not fully encapsulated with a metal jacket\nA that's contributed to it plus I don't my corruption and there was not a single bloods smelting foundry in this country now\nYeah they've they've shut down on the lead smelting which is what is leading to a lot of really cool and innovative ideas or one of them is like that that polymer copper matrix round that we'd spoken previously about um another company that uh I enjoy watching is sports Scott missions they do a solid copper and solid brass projectile\nBut you are getting definitely see there's ... does mysterious costs more typically Dan ... you know going to definitely see a a a raise in the pricing they're inside that as some states actually if you buy more than like a hundred rounds they actually require you to fill out a forty four Seventy three in the background check\nWell\nThe ... and that's all that's all part of the um anti gun\nYou know ... yeah and and unfortunately we we are in the state of Georgia and Georgia is certainly one of the more gun friendly states in this country\nLet's keep it that way and make sure you guys get out there and vote\nYou know for sure yeah we've got especially the of the political again but to get political again you know just be a very important governor's race coming up to date ... I'm offended by some of the uh TV sports that the Democrat running for governor has been airing accusing Kemp\nOf pointing a shotgun at a child ... uh it it wasn't closely the shark young was not pointed as a child but across the front of the trial at an angle away from him and the second shot of a shark gun the shutdown was even closes a breach action sharp done in a breach was broken open\nMight not even pointing any city on his lap\n... and of course his finger is nowhere near as a trigger it it\nJust on those are that's all thinking about how many times this is a running joke you know how many times ... dads the daughter said that they're going to do something similar this is this is not something that's outrageous this is something that's been a running joke ever since I've been alive yeah\n... ... dead waiting on the porch with the with a shotgun because you were you had their daughter was five minutes late for curfew\nThought it was a brilliant political advertising during the primary are looking at a at camp man that was so tongue in cheek yeah apparently the Democrats have disorder that well they have no sense of humor that's true though\nThat are left as no sense of humor and he'll just being a hypocrite you know and you make a joke and of course they want to make it into a big deal and then when you accuse them of some when they say something outrageous they say oh it was just a joke [laughter]\nOr something else that we're starting to see too is you keep hearing this term use assault rifles yes well number one AR does not stand for assault rifle it stands for arm of light which is the original company that designed the rifle ... and it did by definition an assault rifle is something that was capable of going fully automatic\nYeah do you fully automatic but being capable of being a small enough to be carried by industry in battle as opposed to a heavy weapon like and then one go round\nAnd also it's a it's a ... the assault rifle military grade is is a much higher grade they argue couldn't if you took an A R into combat um you'd be in trouble after a couple of magazines\nOr maybe you would have been nearly a ours in her sixties oh tremendous improvement him for a version\nOf another building towards the civilian side of things like competition shooters and stuff like that because well the way that we upgrade our firearms is actually a little bit more cost effective than the military I'm going to go out and buy an entirely new weapon system mhm and it also can make the the average shooter a more effective shooter\nUm but there still is a difference we're not talking military grade weapons ... and that's something that I think needs to be pointed out or\nFrom the research that I've done I'm Jackie part of getting my college degree or we found that they are Fifteen is actually one of the better home defense options standard fifty five green ammunition that you could pick up off the shelf at Walmart doesn't necessarily over penetrate you get thirty rounds a in a magazine on average if you live in a good state", "year": "2018", "show_name": "AM Savannah", "city": "Savannah", "day": "06"}
