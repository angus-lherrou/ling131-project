Joe bugs favorite all time tree\nNow I don't hear any drum roll going if you own dreams going there were Christmas just now waking up oh well all I I\nFigured it would be the the the tree that attracted the most insects but that was just my guess\nIs the rankled crab apple or something that pop where you know\nMy favorite my favorite and the monitor drawn to the highlighted their ...\nGoing to be highlighted in a in a Buckeye yard and garden line posed that I'm working on right now [noise]\nI don't really very baroque oh\nThat was my my mic did one and it does you know ... that's not a problem in sex but you have any of gold now you\nWant to know what I said law well paw paws\nAre right up there that's true yeah I I but but that's yes because that involves food but I Do work for the College of food agriculture and environmental science Hoover so that I like I get that with the pop all but\nSomebody somebody sniffed it out there the boroughs and what I'm writing about our home this mini golf I mean it is\nThat is a ... ... none of them related I say\nI'm not sure that the ... of the most goals is going to be buggy jazz favorite yeah thing exactly\nRight and as a matter of fact the gala I'm writing about our bullet galls these little round that\nYou know it's funny that Iraq has learned in ... when you said bullet goes all the same ... news handwritten\nSpirits that well you know some people think Scott and I are related that's a that's a really be a threat or the weather's going back to your right we always have back the back of playing much you know just where the person now but you know it I\nI Do and I I Want to stress something and this is again you know it's a wonderful tree\nHighly adaptable tree um but you know the Gauls I'm referring to do not cause any appreciable harm whatsoever to the tree so I don't want people to think well I won't plant one of those and\nThere's a great deal of variability within borough within the species in terms of susceptibility to golden fortunately\nYou know we don't really have any data on okay this particular genetic lineage is is more of that one is less susceptible but you do observe this you'll see this in our burrito right you know you walk past one and there's nothing\nWhich you know I mean that's not very interesting that you walk up to the other one and right now one lane that you might find these bullet Gauls are\nThey could have hornets in yellow jackets flying around and I know there are people listening thinking oh my gosh I just got worse you know they get galls then they get it you know all these stinging insects and perhaps even the ants\nBut what makes that fascinating and should be everybody in that city or should just right now be on the edge of their seats\nThe arms got is through and the seven hundred and ... grew\nUp in space well you know what's interesting back all making\nLost in this case is a little tiny ... won't sting of is that they're able to turn genes on and off plant genes on and off and just the right time to grow these structures\nAnd what's even more fascinating these bullet galls also have plant Oregon's in this case what we call extra floral ... meeting those goals actually produce they have little glands on the surface near the surface with a goal that exude nectar\nYou're making this up I Am not man I tell you I'm reading this from science and\nHe says he's off yeah that guy got on the seat [laughter]\nOh I heard a crack in the background [laughter] so\nSo why do they produce the nectar it's to attract guards in\nThis case the guards are going to be things like you know like bolt faced hornets or yellow jackets or paper wasps so they fly in to get a little nectar treat and if there is an enemy of the goal maker they may show up while they have to deal with these pretty a pretty substantial guards\nNow you have to say that isn't that doesn't that make baroque or golf I just\nI mean you plant one just to see this\nI think most people do it on their ...\n[laughter] I just heard a and never saw led balloon go across the floor before either\nI'll make sure that we just bought the baroque to DC age [laughter]\nYou know with that I liked the idea that you have some actually you have some very clean trees there unfortunately\nBut not really getting threatened us that she loves well there you go\nYeah that's what they are I mean these streets just keep giving that's all I can say my favorite though I got to get to sit in here because you guys had my least favorite because there's just no interest there whatsoever but cats are a tree\nLuo fighting words so that was one of the girls are\nLook I I heard Scott say cats are and as they wait a minute it's just the tree I have never found really I mean well okay I my bank cut off in Iraq are extension career I'm a first never seen a disease effect cats are they're they're\nThey're I think you said earlier they're tricky to get started a little bit but once they get going and and by the way spring grove a arboretum and cemetery has the state record Ohio State record surgery they're beautiful big tree and they also have a really nice\nYou know weeping ... a specimen\nBut uh in my entire extent your career the only time I've ever seen anything happen the cancer was when we had an outbreak of forcing caterpillar\nAnd those caterpillars had consumed everything them and they were down to ... you know across artificial turf looking for a bike\nAnd I did find some feeding on cats are up but not very much\nAnd so those trees really I mean they are one of the day and game shows\nA very old trees by the way our\nOur loaded up with chemicals apparently that suppress pests and diseases and you know from my perspective than white\nPlant them if they're not going to you know show no galls or no other only use euro bonds homeland\n[laughter] always a pleasure [noise]\nAnd I hear that music is the clan assigned journal just to get you often hear [laughter] that's right I got hit the music by them I always a pleasure go bucks go by the guy's daycare\nOh my goodness things the ... stone VCR read 'em dot org thanks to run robbers armored Dr dot com things has got beer line Cincinnati Zoo done or should be since he will tentacle garden but we'll work on that somewhere down the\nPeople keep up the pressure thinks all three of you for being your green information of course a website dress standing as well so be sure check those out to thank all of our sponsors things of course DNA Gleason to drink a kid growing does because we're not doing those without having to do something was going to plant a tree those pollinator plants and making the best we can all be like\nRolling on now with the one eight hundred and eighty three talking you're listening to be in the garden with Latinos and\n... you know when you\nThe eggs that some of them went through\nNow this is what I was told by people that\nDid like like a there's a guy that wrote a book about like linear it's reference in the book he told me that you think about these people or subsistence farmers and they said we're going to give you this much money for your lane and that was probably more money than they ever had in their life but they live hand to mouth from their own and then they went to had to go up high property they last nominally\nTraditional land but they lost money because they couldn't buy the land for what they were you know\nRunning and get the money that they could have that I needed that it you know they lost in the end I Know but there was no good stories about anybody prospering because he left like a a linear and they gave you whatever the property was worse than in my book I tell the numbers\nThey couldn't go back and buy property I'm ... years to extend it was right there ghost towns because they lost a lot of what George didn't used to be\nI don't think a lot of people realize that these are manmade lakes but it's fascinating to me that they're literally pounds underneath their flooded there's hundreds of them I Would\nAlmost more like communities but I never did find a lot of towns and it was getting me frustrated 'cause they get I gotta go sounds [laughter] but what I found was like lake linear has um loopers a racetrack underneath it\nAnd when the water goes down ... remember when it's drought right what was it you have an eight to ten um you could actually see the stands from the home I go to the F interests see\nOne of the people that were holding out like the lady and while river when they say and I know when I worked for a while\nYeah there was one in one story that she took a gun and said you know what my property yet they held out\nBut then they had to take them to the main they stuck yes they did it and they they didn't get a lot for a lot more stories in Tennessee and North Carolina um that would match these and sometimes I Would go into those areas to see what happened there because it was so similar\nDid they moved from buildings to or something an hour some of those buildings going around and they may move out of those\nYeah Africa is a real important one um I work in Calhoun and write down the road is the new it showed a\nThey move vans tavern from the lake lanier air because that's where it was\nTo the new uh ... uh which is the Cherokee Nation of capital\nAnd that building was and what have been under like linear\nIf it wasn't moved that was really important one that they've been they've been as they did that had to be a corner undertaking to move on and so when I started researching I just get all excited 'cause I get to go to the national archives in Atlanta they're wonderful there to help you find what you're looking for so I said I Need anything on the lakes north Georgia\nAnd all they found what will all day with tons and tons of pictures from the northern lakes um they had pictures that were literally in cold storage and when I say cold storage it was in a fridge writer room and they kept these negatives there that were taken by the um I guess was the Army Corps\nAnd hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of negative so my son is hard Samuel spent hours with me scanning of they let us do it for free we had to do the work and when to label them\nAnd so about a whole bunch of images in my book or the from those images you she's nobody's ever published a cold storage for years on my gosh what a narrow it down to a problem yeah I was trying to find the most interesting and it had pictures of people's houses being moved building the moving over gas station they live\nTo see all those people I don't know you naturally wonder what was going all the time what and how they ended up\nAnd now a lot of the most um documented information I could get was unlike linear and they were a lot of controversy on that one was Gainesville times I did a lot of articles and they did an article about a couple that says you know we're not better off without all the money was going to help us we're not better\nSo it's very political too especially the near and and I'm now to an or very political they didn't they to do it you know all these you know parades all kinds of stuff\nSo politics got involved in this funny how Jimmy Carter basically in the end when in the end of the book he when he was president he found that the U.S Army Corps was basically you have some agencies try to justify their existence and they kept building lakes because that's what they did and they did it well since the fifties low thirties\nWell they started meant more like in the forties and fifties but Georgia Power had building all those lakes is is it that was called the great lakes as north Georgia for the starts with 'em\nUp their Rayburn county and you know down like raven Burton like Alice bird was probably the earliest one that I said Blue Ridge but I think it was Burt and I have a chart much book that show was the earliest ones in with\nOne of these some of those areas to oppose of those are the reverse because I'm pretty sure no I'd have to state that I'm not a biologist I'm not historian\nI'm not an archaeologist but I've become a little bit of an amateur enjoying loving it because I joined organizations so I can learn from them\nAnd somebody suggested I joined the society for George archeology and I did because they are you some of the material and now I'm going to be speaking at there in in November and they're big southeastern I'm thinking oh my gosh I'm Out of my league because I'm not an archaeologist\nThey want to know the stories and that's what writers do is they just tell a story and I write creative non fiction micro history is and what they do is I take some small something that\nIn significant sum forgotten and try to make it ... it made a big difference that I I'm trying to make a story out of things because if if he could tell a story people going to read it and understand it but if it's just a bunch of facts you know sometimes they won't listen and it's interesting it was a whole journey so\nI understand what you mean where you start out with something and it kind of becomes a living breathing thing and nobody wants to go it takes you where it was totally\nI mean I just had no idea I wanted to know what it was like for ...\nYou know in the Seventeen hundreds to come to Georgia what would it look like so I Would read the stuff and I'd see it was a wild place with wild rivers and and people my children and grandchildren\nWill never see that I never see that you know I was raised we talking about the lakes the natural my husband was born and raised and we feel Katty Kay is that he saw Carter's like being dug out in the rivers damned any hurt all the stories his grandfather is in the book you tell stories grandfather told them a lot about the area\nThe thing was I was born in western New York I'm a Yankee but I've been in the south lawn or I'm going to college here I mean I took my husband up to Lake Erie to visit my family and the first thing he said when he got back and go you can't see across and I'm like what\nIf we can't see across I never seen anything like that and I realized she spent his whole life in North Georgia where there's not a natural lakes yeah so you can't see across\nI've been out in the middle of Lake Erie county's right it's like an ocean\nTo me so that would have thought it was like the oh she's the honestly said to me are you sure we're not looking at the ocean I said we're in western\nNew York today we're talking about the underwater ghost towns of north Georgia that is a time of a book by Lisa Russell fascinating topic we all know these lakes around Georgia where we don't know how they got here and there is a great history behind that to\nA and probably some not so great history around that as well\nSomething that you bring up in here is obviously the movie deliverance everybody's familiar with the Burt Reynolds among the stars just passed away James Dickey wrote that\nIn your book you talk about what might have been this is about four men are going to canoe trip because the river is going to be funded by lake just like we've been talking about people haven't seen the movie ... it's based on him to prince taking a trip down a river ... it seems very cryptic that he came back and we'll talk about it\nYeah 'cause I was like wanting to know you know 'cause I went to the MSA program at Reinhardt just to speak one time and they have a whole thing I'm James Dickey 'cause he's a Georgia author so I didn't know much about him and everything and it and I only watched delivers part of it so I\nStarted getting into it more and I and I uh James Dickey son came to that conference and ice ... Chris Dickey he wrote a hang wrote a book called um summer of deliverance and he talks about how his father came home\nOne day from a trip he was all shook up you know and then he was all beat up in the ... you had some kind of weird experience that he didn't really want to talk about it but um his father sat there and I don't know if they had to use a tape recorder whatever into wrote down the whole thing about James thinking one would not he's not alive anymore but he would not\nAdmit that it was ... when they were about to build Carter's lake and the timing was it was just seem to be like that was what it was yeah so I asked his son\nChris wrote them an email said them that are that I like to talk to you but the stance of me that's what ... ... ... like I mean that was being built", "year": "2018", "show_name": "AM Savannah", "city": "Savannah", "day": "07"}
