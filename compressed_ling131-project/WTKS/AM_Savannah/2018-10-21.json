exactly I think maybe I misunderstood but I thought I heard her say that they sprayed and um\nAnd you're right that kinda triggers my thinking that well maybe a\nMaybe a contact insecticide was used and uh you know one that they can crawl through but they tend to to be a little more effective because they can take them back to the colonies and and that will help to suppress the comedies but\nBut that's what you and I always recommend that you know we we have fantastic pest control operators in a home in this case the person would be license for outdoor applications a but in the south I mean the professionals down there are a very good at this they have a lot of experience but occasionally\nWe can run across the challenge and it's like anything you know it's like you take your car to a mechanic and maybe it's not the best fix so what do you do you find another one right right that's kind of the situation I think that that that I Would recommend but uh but\nBack to fire ants moving north yeah that's\nYou know I'm not a I'm not predicting this anytime soon and obviously we don't know for sure you know how things are going to pan out\nUh with are changing climate are it does appear as you said the the track is you know temperatures gradually warming moving north I think probably the the the the main point I'm driving as we don't have a crystal ball is to win and and how deep and so and so forth but uh [noise]\nYou know they have been found a obviously in Tennessee and parts of southern Kentucky so it's that's not too far from the Midwest\nAnd those armadillos\nOut there and and the miniature armored deal they armadillo bugs don't get me started on those\nSeriously that armadillos in southwestern Kentucky\nI you know I I I hate to say this I heard that and I I didn't believe it or you know you you know you hear what Ninety One and then you bring the Kentucky wildlife people that confirmed that are yeah mine did some yeah armadillos oh my goodness\nI one one last thing before you get in a way we're going to talk about we also had someone calling in about\nThe hitting that uh you know the Hornet or yellow jackets noticed in the ground yeah with the author and how the you know to how to dress in that situation\nWell the good news is all they hit it with an ogre\nYeah there were plenty of your ear that oh I didn't hear that I Know that they got ... got away\nAnd so now there's this whole with the mess somewhere in the hole and\nThe other question was you know how do we how do we tackle this at this stage\nWell now I Need to ask us that they um the day and then if I Am where they were rather low key\nYou know now and the problem and ruin the hits and then I don't know I mean\nWere they in the ... were they in a northern location or where they\nDo and they were in South Carolina they were also in South Carolina okay well that are North Carolina when one of the Carolinas well you know yellow jackets you're either yeah OK Charlotte's wealth Carolina North Carolina\nUh yeah I should know that I mean we like NASCAR right yeah um well\nYellow jackets and this is very important because I just got up I got an email this past week you know with a yellow jackets and a barn and uh it was apparently very close to where they go into the the barn and you know what should they do and\nWell I just got last week well here in Ohio that's not going to be a problem much longer because\nYellow jackets bald face torn it's a paper last they only use their Nast one season you've talked about this I yeah I've heard this many times that you know you're making that point the challenges of South Carolina situation though is uh you know the cold or North Carolina gosh I keep doing that\nUm the challenge there the temperatures are going to take a while to drop\nA those yellow jackets will be you know getting cooler and cooler at night and\nNow that they're in the nest as exposed you know that's going to make it even harder for them because you know they're they're thinking [laughter] you know they they don't plan on dying in the winter by the way I mean this is kind of a I Know I'm being a little bit you know kind of putting human traits on them but\nYou know there you'll see them clustering in these ness while you probably should look too closely but you'd see them clustering they're trying they're attempting to make it through the winter but they just can't\nNow that the necessarily exposed as I said that's going to make it even worse for them um you know there are you know there are insecticides that could be used as you know and and and and that are labeled for that use\nBut I wouldn't do it during a warm day and you could maybe take advantage they can take advantage of a day that's a little bit you know where the temperatures are low but\nUh\nThey can really at this time of year with a ... number in and ask them they should have said that ah\nAt this time of year we have the maximum number of workers in the death\nOf those ... produced queens that uh that will fly off well both males and females they mate and then the queen's fly off individually and find a place to spend the winter\nAnd the original Nast as I said they just sit there with the workers until they finally they finally die but in this case it may take awhile normally we just say wait it out but if they're waiting to plant a tree you know\nHow do they need to wait and as I said you know it could be possible for them to use an insecticide suppress it but once\nAgain you don't want to be spraying when they're buzzing around because\nI suddenly a level of water I suggest goes out there in the darkness and filling up with water\nYou know the I didn't hear that and that's and that's not a bad idea\nAnd then there was water I mean there's there's no defense against that\nThat's exactly that's that's a good idea and I hear music\nMan I'm Sorry around a timing some months for all you've done for us this year we will look forward to talking to you were a obviously our Thanksgiving special I Hope you're going to be here for that\nI was like you I won't miss him because we always have some food that comes in and drink and so\nI really appreciate it\nI go by gotta ... thanks so our costs are sponsors of course the dream of our producer went out during the ... and none as what happened to do something about we're going to Planetree deep lenders pollinator plans to making the best we can have your life\nOf what are some of the pitfalls of of a food allergy as you know things to look out for um the you know things like if you're if you're going to the holidays coming up you're going to maybe a holiday dinner or something like you don't know what's in some of the food what are the ... some of the way you can do that just some of the words of advice on how to approach it\nWell I think the one of the biggest things is that food allergies are really serious issue this is not just an intolerance or a preference or a you know my my tummy hurts if I eat the wrong thing this really has the potential to be you know a life or death type of situation\nAnd patients that have food allergies are exquisitely sensitive to the things that they're allergic to so that really only small traces of a food could cause a big reaction in them so it's not as simple as well if there's a\nYou know if there's a dish that may have nuts mixed in it just pick the nuts out and you'll be fine but in fact you have to be quite careful in general I tell my patients if it's not clear whether a food is safe to eat that don't eat it it really needs to be a quite strict and so\nFor family members who may be getting together with others at holidays at at Halloween or or\nBeyond Thanksgiving Christmas and eating together they may seem alarmed at that level of precaution but that's actually what's needed to keep these kids safe oftentimes parents will actually prepare separate foods for that child that they know to be safe\nSo that when they eat for example at a potluck or a buffet they don't take the risk of an accident happening\nIn that case if something does happen obviously you called nine one one but are there some other things that you can do to deal with that situation you own emerging bases into medical help ... can get there\nWell if somebody is experiencing the symptoms of an allergic reaction after an accidental exposure\nThan this is where the up enough for an auto injector comes in and uh and that's the most critical step that can be taken obviously you need to have it on you are in that case to be able to administer it and so that's the most important rule for for families always to carry those epinephrine and directors wherever they go\nSometimes mild symptoms can be treated with a just a simple and a histamine like Bennett drill\nBut generally once the reaction starts to spread beyond a simple skin reaction than generally we advise people to go ahead and use their epinephrine auto injector and get to the hospital as quickly as they can typically by calling nine one one\nWhen somebody sees an allergist like yourself what type of testing do you do to determine what type of allergies I have\nOne of the most important thing that we do and it sounds very simple in elementary is we take a history and we try to understand where patients have had to clear exposures that have resulted in clear allergic reactions\nFrom there we proceed to testing it seems that you know maybe we should just run past than the if somebody is allergic or not and we do have skin tests in that we do in the office than blood tests as well\nBut the tests only make sense and people that have had symptoms or\nThese do not work like other kinds of tests and medicine like say a pregnancy test where you get an answer yes or no you are pregnant or you are not pregnant that's not the way allergy tests work so if you run a whole bunch of tests on people you'll find that they can be positive and people who are not allergic\nA and that that means the history is really a a very crucial Pete I like to tell patients\nEverybody that's allergic has a positive test\nBut not everybody that has the positive test is allergic and that can get somewhat fusing which is why it's really important to sit down take some time and go through a careful history of the kinds of symptoms that people have had after eating\nYou are the director of the children's health care but land a food allergy center and then I just write you a very very specialized and so you have physicians I'm assuming from all of the state of Georgia referring children do you talk about what you do there at the food allergy center and where you're located\nWell thank you I'm I was pleased to be recruited to establish the center I started in the end of march\nThis represents an investment on children's part and Emery university is part\nTo establish this new center and recognition of the fact that millions of kids are affected by these problems and there are no approved treatments to use in them and so this represents a major\nUnmet medical need both around the country and then certainly in Georgia where where no such center previously existed so I'm happy to be here to get this started the center has sort of I Would call it a try apartheid mission of clinical care research and sort of education an advocacy\nWe will be happy to see patients from all over the state and region on a ... basis and provide the highest quality evidence based care that we can for those patients and start to implement new treatments as they become available on the research side of the house will be offering patience the opportunity\nTo participate in studies either as we simply follow them and clinic if they elect to participate or or even potentially in clinical trials of new medicines and treatments that are being studied\nA it's a very exciting time right now in food allergy we have not had much to offer patients but through research it seems very likely that pretty soon we'll be able to do that and this is the kind of thing that the center is set up to do\nHow can people find out more information about you and it certainly um I'm sure won't physicians to refer people to to your services to\nThat's right so we've built to a website that that\nWe will continue to keep updated and the address there is show a dot org slash food allergy and that's probably the easiest way to find information about what we do a and reach out to us we have a referral line that everybody can use at the area code for oh four Seventy five kids\nWe obviously want to be a resource for the state and the region and a big part of what we do is is that outrage and opening our doors to everyone\nThat don't you Brian Vickers ... director of children's health care but land has food allergies center children's health care sports medicine treats more than the traditional sports like
