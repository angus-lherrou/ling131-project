{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "I I well yeah yeah yeah I I you watch the people that do this professionally and I always made me mad oh they can just go right on right on through there and it's like\nWell but you know they don't of course you know we've got the market corner on planting trees right\nOh yeah I'm going on now has a better during the world\nThere you go and the longer\nI I have a hard time talking to but you know it looked like you it it it is All right Bye bye and you know it's it's a funny thing that uh yeah I Do have\nTo lower your back you're all you're pulling the well I ... back or something\nWell you know that I'm pulling I'm actually I think I'm actually pushing it in because that's the yeah that's I've just loaded up God it was a brand new car and uh you know and and and I'm about ready to go hand in nylon ankle sock\nBuckle under the ... that's\nWell yeah that's mine I on a sock yeah they're very comfortable there was a lesbian I that's my hand written by collector and all those things all claim\nBut you know seriously it is as I say in there and of course you know I've talked about this before there are good traps for around ... now that's not that's not to say you can trap\nBox or bugs or western conifer seed bugs or\nMulti color and Asian lady beetles\nWe have these other invaders that if you do you use a a brown ... stink bug trap it won't do anything for them so\nAs I said in that article you know the that that trap should not replace closing up entry point and and the trap should be used obviously if you're under siege if you learn you know the way I say I know that's kind of end up saying it's sort of well I didn't know\nThat we had a problem but to use them and in in place of finding places where they're coming in and also means\nThat you're losing air conditioning out the you know air conditioning air out in the summer and heated they're out in the winter so I'm usually they can't get in our home unless there is an opening well I shouldn't say usually there has to be an opening big enough for them to get into the home which means of course you've got ... age\nSo that's the place to start and it's still not too late for that obviously um it isn't too late to check around windows it's a you know a lot of these ... material do have a low temperature threshold for for use but you know we're not\nWe're not going to be at that consistently uh the other point about the uh about checking for entry points and I say this in the article and you know I've talked about this go into the attic you know during the day\nUh and of course the lights off and the addict don't walk around or he could end up in in the second floor of the for you really are the ceiling awry\nBut just standing there with the lights off in the attic and sometimes it's surprising how many openings that you'll see now of course this off it's along the edge you know that run along the top of the law\nThey may very well let light and so you had to be a little careful about that but why we're talking about ... off as old as as they age they can sometimes start flexing coming loose a and you need to check those\nThat frankly is where I see a lot of brown mom rented and multi colored Asian lady beetles making her way into homes because they're tracked into radiating heat either off the walls or coming out from the interior of the of the house\nSo you have sunlight hitting the wall and radiate it he comes off that will pull these insects him\nAnd then with that is why we see them on the side of houses sometimes in very large numbers well\nThe next thing will do start crawling up and what is the first thing they hit when they crawl off of this office if if you have a gap between the law is often well they'll just keep walking right up into the addict and then of course if\nThey would stay in the attic that would be our own body it'd be All right 'cause they're actually just after cooling down through the winter they they're not really after coming into the home\nThe idea that they have in mind as they put a lot of fat reserves away and they they want to slow their metabolism down by just remaining cool because they are cold blooded and our metabolisms tied to the outside temperature\nBut sometimes they accidentally come all the way in the home and of course then they're in real trouble because there's nothing for them to eat\nAnd their metabolism is out cranked up because you know we ever temperature set Seventy degrees\nThere about and uh and and that causes them to starve to death and that's one reason we often see brown ... stink bugs in multi ... lady beetles and box or bugs in the home flying all around the you know\nThey're they're not trying to be me they're just you know their their panic Barrow they're then they're they're looking for some of the\nIf you listen closely there saying help me [laughter] I don't want our world who want to [laughter]\nOh my goodness the cold medicines kicking in right yeah I Wish it was so that's a so that is\nThat the the rap on fall invaders a and we're not we're not done for the season even though we do have coal companies out there I'm I'm going to probably do another posting and we already talked about this but\nI've gotten to report this week uh kissing bugs\nThat aren't kissing go back to kissing bugs again\nBatch right so listeners look up we'll bugs if you think you have a kissing bud look up ... like a wheel of a car\nAnd you'll find that you probably have we'll bugs or they're ... they're good bonus kind but I kind of bugs always a pleasure green information go bucks\nGo boxing you take care of yourself or are they feel good talking to your son it's it\nRemains\nThanks overconfident sponsors thinks of course to the Durango to denigrate some because without any most of what happened I Do some favorite thing about where you going to go out there and play a bitch tree more trees where you know pointless pollinator plants yet this fall [noise] let me give us the best we can have your life the\nDid like like a there's a guy that wrote a book about like letting here it's reference in the book he told me that you think about these people or so students farmers and they said we're going to give you this much money for your land and that was probably more money than they ever had in their life but they live hand to mouth from their own and then they went to had to go up high property they last nominally\nTraditional land but they lost money because they couldn't buy the land for what they were you know\nRunning and get the money that they could have that I needed that it you know they lost in the end I Know but there was no good stories about anybody prospering because he left like a a linear\nAnd they gave you whatever the property was worse than in my book I tell the numbers they couldn't go back and buy property I'm like ... pounds because they lost a lot of what George and used to be\nI don't think a lot of people realize that these are manmade lakes but it's fascinating to me that they're literally pounds underneath their flooded there's hundreds of them I Would have\nAlmost more like communities but I never did find a lot of towns and it was getting me frustrated 'cause I'm thinking I'm going to write goes down [laughter] but what I found is like lake linear had um loopers a racetrack underneath it and when the water goes down\n... remember when it's drought right yeah what was it was an eight to ten um you could actually see the stands from the home I go to the F interests they\nWere the people that were holding out by the lady and while river when they say and I'm not gonna work for a while\nYeah there was one in one story that she took a gun and said you know if my property yet they held out um but then they had to take them to the main they kind of stuck yes they did it and they they didn't get a lot for a lot more stories in Tennessee and North Carolina um that would match these and sometimes I Would go into those areas to see what happened there because it was so similar\nDid they move some buildings to or something and our son was building still around and they may move animals\nAre yeah I figure if they're real important one um I work in Calhoun and write down the road is the newest show that\nThey move vans tavern from the lake lanier air because that's where it was\nTo the new uh ... uh which is the Cherokee Nation of capital\nIn that building was in would have been under like linear\nIf it wasn't moved that was real important when they moved in thank goodness I did I had to be a corner undertaking to move bill and so when I started researching I just get all excited 'cause I get to go to the national archives in Atlanta they're wonderful there to help define what you're looking for if I said I Need anything on the lakes north Georgia\nAnd all they found what will all day with tons and tons of pictures from the northern lakes um they had pictures that were literally and cold storage and when I say cold storage it was in a fridge raider room and they kept these negatives there that were taken by the um I guess was the Army Corps\nAnd hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of negative so my son [laughter] bless his heart Samuel spent hours with me scanning that they let us do it for free we had to do the work and when to label them and so about a whole bunch of images in my book or the from those images you gee nobody that's published in the cold storage for years\nOn my gosh you to narrow it down to a problem yeah that'd be\nTrying to find the most interesting and it had pictures of people's houses being moved building the mother no gas station they\nActually do the book to see all those people I don't know you naturally wonder what was going all the time and how they ended up\nAnd that well a lot of the most um documented information I could get was unlike linear and they were a lot of controversy on that one of the thing was gaze will times I did a lot of articles and they did an article about a couple that says no we're not better off without all this money was going to help us we're not better\nOff so it's very political too especially in the near and and I'm now too and we're very political they didn't they to do it you know all these you know parades all kinds of stuff\nSo politics got involved in this funny how Jimmy Carter basically in the end when in the end of the book he when he was president and he found that the U.S Army Corps was basically you know how some agencies try to justify their existence and they kept building lakes because that's what they didn't they did it well since the fifties low thirties\nWell they started ... more like in the forties and fifties but George power had build all those lakes is is it that was called the great lakes with north Georgia because it starts with 'em\nUp their Rayburn county and you know down\nLike raven Burton like all this bird was probably the earliest one that I said Blue Ridge but I think it was ... and I have a chart much book that shows the earliest ones in with why do they select those areas to fit opposes those are the reverse because I'm pretty sure you know I'd have to state that I'm not a biologist I'm not historian\nI'm not an archaeologist but I've become a little bit of an amateur enjoying loving it because I joined organizations are so I can learn from them\nAnd somebody suggested I joined the society for George archeology and I did because they are you some of the material and now I'm going to be speaking at there in in November and they're big southeastern if they get oh my gosh I'm outta my league because I'm not an archaeologist\nThey want to know the stories and that is what writers do and they just tell a story and I write creative non fiction micro history is not that do is I take some small something that\nIn significant sum forgotten and try to make it or the ... it made a big difference that I I'm trying to make a story of things because if if he could tell a story people going to read it and understand it but if it's just a bunch of facts you know sometimes they won't listen and it's interesting it was a whole journey so\nI understand what you mean where you start out with something and it kind of becomes a living breathing thing and nobody wants to go it takes you where it was totally\nI mean I just had no idea I wanted to know what it was like for ...\nYou know in the Seventeen hundreds to come to Georgia what would it look so I Would read the stuff and I see it was a wild place with wild rivers and and people my children and grandchildren will never see that I never see that you know I was raised we talking about the
