I get pulled over police officer comes up to my window and I have a gun in the car why should I Do baskets that all the time asked by one of the most ask questions we\nGet another one of the answers as don't grab the gun\nYou know grabbing a weakness to help people to be patient be calm and we tell them you know communications on our part as from the law enforcement standpoint that the key ingredient is the same thing for the civilians and communication communication thinking\nA communication such a key for everything we do anymore and it's also a key for the civilians we tell them to keep their hands where they where the law enforcement can clearly see them keep your hands usually keep them on top of the steering wheel um in\nIn a in a very calm manner let the police officer know that they do have a firearm let them know where the farm is in the car letting them know whether the farms load it or not um and just be very calm and let the police officer and his name I'm just let you know that I Do have a weapon in the car and where the weapons locate it\nYou know I have in my judgment on classes given uh just for that exact same voice I also was ... my students to refer to the weapon\nAs a weapon or a a firearm and not to use the word gun gun um if I if I'm correct to under Georgia law you have a Georgia weapons carry license\nYou are not a required to a show that the officer but my advice to my students is why wouldn't you\nExactly and and like I said you know the two two best route for ah getting along in in making things smoothed on a on a traffic stop is is honesty and communication non honesty and the communication that you get and being calm you gotta understand you know we talk on the law enforcement officers experience to you know what\nIt's not easy for them to approach that car they they understand the threats they understand and you know they're going through their threat assessment as they approached a car and uh if you if you have a little heightened sense of excitement\nOr a that nature the author picks up from that he or she picks up from that and they also they react from that as well so you're calmness your ... year level hadn't aside and also the author picks up from that as well too and you know they they're going through their threat assessment\nYou want to go on from ... and you'll do condition orange red or black you want to stay in their worst at its best actually in condition you'll exactly a heightened sense of awareness without any kind of a panic Gura or fear pheromone getting into the air\nExactly and in that and the police officer saw so we we also training their train us and not everybody's having a good day\n[laughter] and now when you get pulled over ... having a name you already having a bad day that just adds to any of the officers are also trying to pick up on those those kind of used to as well because you know we we we try to tell them you know\nIt's a communication to a process there and then everybody's calm and using level handle stuff and and then then you know like you brought up the shooting or the north Carolina a state trooper to ... ah during the week\nIt's ... you know a lot more saucers they're not you know the civilians aren't really wants to see in these stories and reading these stories and seeing the medium as\nThe law enforcement officers are too and it's you know send it back in their mind you know well you know you got a law enforcement officer tonight and it's gonna below car over and you don't think that when he's a he or she is approaching that car that story about what happened to the north Carolina state trooper and represent a traffic stop that pressure on their mind\nGoes ... there was one of these two lanes out in the country a more rural or sections of Chatham county there are a few of those legs ... and uh there was a little or no lighting a some last night ah I'd rather them middle and\nOh where are you going to make the ... they haven't been there done that got to make the officer or a little bit on the uh uh\nHe may be the only side certainly say maybe ... maybe the only law and fifty miles will or twenty miles or so\nWell yeah and probably don't shout I'm Johnny but in a lot of the ... of Georgia that that would be exactly the gay and you're getting\nThis county down around ... around where county it's not a lot of there you're right there there are backup might be Fifteen twenty miles away now\nYou know in the cold in and maybe there's a once a warrants out on the vehicle and uh the officer knows who's got a a potential ... traffic stop there\nAnd ins and you ask the unknown and we talk about that one of the things we talk about the police officers have two\nLittle obstacles they have to come over and we hear it through the media and stories and the print media as well as well as the news is you know even on the the shows you the last ... and and and and stuff like that you're always somebody the routine traffic stop there is no such thing as rich are absolutely not\nI says unknown his either high risk vehicle stops are unknown traffic stop and that's what you know our ass out my pleaded the citizens were also you know put yourself in law enforcement officers position as well too because just what I said the unknowns the unknowns that are therefore allow for sauces and when they approached as cars\nWhen they actually get up to the car and they start their interaction with the civilians you know put yourself in the law enforcement officer's perspective there of the unknowns that's involved and and and the risk\nOf this involved and and conducting these type of a law enforcement activities\nThere are some of the other voice are given students in my classes is that it makes no sense to be argumentative uh know was the office of this polio are being ... what are you going to gain\nWeight at yeah there's only two votes and he's got it or she's got it and you just go along with it\nYeah you are you are you are I'm go further with a little bit of a honey than it will some some vinegar here\nAnd then from our side we also train our officers there'll be argumentative as well um you're not going to solve anything out there on the side of the ... [laughter] ah that's what we tell them so\nWe you know would would verbal the escalation a training in Myrtle the escalation techniques where the traffic stops are as something that we're spending a lotta time on right now because", "year": "2018", "show_name": "AM Savannah", "city": "Savannah", "day": "20"}
