down bars what branch should I be looking at and is that found bar by proportionate to eat the\nYeah the sound bar is a is a convenience more than great audio you know that I mean ideally you'd have for but who has ... space for this uh you'd have a left right center channel so that's three speakers in the front you'd have a sub woofer although many soundbites now come with some more first and then\nTo get the full surround sound you have to speakers cut up or at your ear distance from the TV left and right as the surrounds and then some people even have at most of the above board firing speakers they have a rare surrounds that go\nBehind you or it depends how serious you are about ... ... great because TVs generally come with awful sound those videos you the sound on that right it sounds like birth her her ... her\nYeah it's very it's very flat in in my living in this actually pretty large my couch I with\nFaith easily may be anywhere from Fifteen feet away from the TV so it it's very difficult to hear\nYou yeah ... yeah so that's kind of a\n... that's one of the things you'd get with a barge get much richer sat and much louder sounds\nA Scott Wilkins at our home theater gigs always recommending ... if\nIf if you don't want to spend a thousand dollars on a sound bar and you certainly can poke audio and others have very expensive sound ... if you're gonna spend that kind of money I'd say don't do you know unless wiring as an issue don't do a salad bar but if you want to spend about a hundred and fifty dollars\nBusy you as a very nice sound bar with a sub offer a wireless sub woofer which gives you a nice rich sound\nAnd with the sound bars they have multiple speakers in them their their bars they go along the entire bottom of the screen\nAnd often have seven or eight speakers in there which means they can simulate surround this the one I'm looking at the um visit us be thirty eight Twenty one is the thirty eight is it's it's like thirty eight inches wide so it's almost as wide as your at your TV [noise] and it sounds great I think it's and that's a hundred and fifty bucks\nFans that that's pretty good right yeah yeah appreciate you my pleasure yeah I mean like I said you can spend my wife bought a a a bows\nA salad bar plus ... and it had to kind of a navy receiver in it and all that jazz and it ended up being a twenty five hundred dollars which this was a this is before we were married I\nProbably would have stopped or if if you're going to if you want to spend that kind of money you'd really benefit from having\nAn A.
