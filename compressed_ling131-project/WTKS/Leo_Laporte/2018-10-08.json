{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "Hey you've heard me talk a lot about apps and he ... printers you're about to hear me again because the hips and he could take forty seven fifty is downright revolutionary there's a wireless ... printer doesn't use ink cartridges that means no more or less it runs to the store late night freak out because you run out of ink\nYou could take forty seven fifty as easy to fill in the tanks and get this they print up to eleven thousand color pages\nSo it's a great idea\nYou know this is a this is an interesting debate in uh in photography it's a great idea to to get an air changeable lens camera because you could do different things with different lenses you know a telephoto lens is great for sports and other events where you can't get close to the action a wide angle lens is great for\nArchitecture and landscapes you know taking and and if we're portrait sure you want a slightly longer lands maybe uh eighty five millimeter lands\nThat can handle low light and that way you can get great portraits\nOr with great depth of field you know the background kind of fades away and the end and the portrait pops out so each lands has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however and you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes wide\nJust kind of ... somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven to your ... something like that [noise] um [noise] that is a nice all purpose lens a lot of teachers suggests starting with a single prime lands uh Fifteen millimeter lands which approximate the guy\nAnd really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it and move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that is going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have\nTo do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kitten lands and then the question is what do I need any other ... yeah yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening he can get and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do F. one point eight have to at one point I even at one point for those are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means they're great for not using flash for for getting a natural images they're great for torture they tend to be more expensive and you'll never\nSee assume we call it a fast lands when it can do that you know ever sees him that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom is maybe two point four three point five something like that and okay okay so I\nThink about instead of getting the ... getting a body and then getting a nice say F. one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching lands but you've got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon and you're going to be going cannon or an icon lenses forever after you know because they have custom ounce each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the night cons ah I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently should Sony's which are mirror lists\nUm but ... but for her first camera maybe an icon de thirty five hundred a this is a good ... camera it's who you know it starts at five hundred bucks\nA it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about this is an A. P. S. C. censor which is a large censored but not full framed full frame gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want\nBut I think this the D. thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four Seventy a lens that goes with the kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is deep he reviewed dot com digital photography review dot com they have a best camera for beginners buying guide that we'll talk about the pros and cons they liked the can and then when you were looking at the ios rebel Estelle to\nOkay that's another very nice one but that talk about the pros and cons of each\nAnd I'm gonna throw in one third one that is to me are the most flexible solution\nWhich is an Olympic is only MD now this is a smaller censored some what we call micro for third censor the micro for thirds cameras have one big advantage many companies make the lenses so you have many of literally hundreds of choices of lenses\nAnd that is kind of nice my wife shoots an MD ah E. M. five I think Mark Mark or I Can't remember ... ... one more five something like that\nAnyway it's a very the O M deserved compact they are interchangeable lens and you have a huge number of choices\nOf lenses so I Would I go to deep you review read the beginner best camera for beginners buying guide they also have a best camera for students guide a and that will give you some more information um the the three cameras I've mentioned here are absolutely top of the wind cameras\nAnd it's a great project for her to be involved in unless you want to do it as a Christmas gift\nYeah okay and I think she would like to be you know what\nYour thoughts about any advantages of ah picking up some specifically a a ... give a brand name a number a Amazon versus a local cameras store\nAs a matter of doesn't matter guy by most of my cameras and Amazon are OK okay did enough to support local camera store is if\nYou happen to have one but [noise] the prices are going to be a little higher there and you know our local cameras are disappearing even though I support them\nSo I Will report [noise]\nNews radio\nHave heard me talk a lot about ... printers you're about to hear me again because the ... tank forty seven fifty is downright revolutionary there's a ... printer doesn't use ink cartridges that means no more last minute runs to the store late night freak outs because you've run out of ink\nHe could take forty seven fifty as easy to fill in the tanks and get this they print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat time I think you get in the box it's equivalent to thirty Carter says if you had to buy the it'd be about Fifteen hundred bucks saves you money saved your time and when they say all in one apps and means that the ups and he could take forty seven fifty as fast auto two sided printing it copies of scans effects as in more go to ... dot com slash ...\nIn a sour Pete envoys list\nPrice dealer price to be happier if your car shopping you probably heard these terms\nWhat do they mean it's so confusing well it was confusing not anymore I'm telling you about true price from ... it's a price it actually means something because it's the exact price you pay for the car you want including season accessories and basketball you'll know if you're a true prices competitive because true car shows you what other people are paying\nFor it with boxing at the top and bottom of the child was ready to your point seven and will not have a duty so bad [noise]\nOverboard the tech guy [noise]\nEighty eight eighty eight at the [noise]\nLet's try again we've already pay already are you there\nYeah so you had mute on didn't you go yeah good to see a welcome\nThank you I spoke to before um do you um I haven't noticed H. and I have a plan ...\nA Bluetooth headset yeah a fifty two on them I have this issue we all my notes or been buying notes from no one I\nThink you're having the issue right now are you on the no right now we lost we lost her for a second there yet all I heard was you've you've had all the notes and you had an issue what's the issue\nAnd the Chavez media or do you um that turns off randomly or because it's connected to Iceland as well as Newt age\nUh [noise] so you're using your are you talking about the on the plane ...\nYes and I have a plan to annex connected to books loans I've flown and also\nAlso periodically the ... the plant products will say oh I'm going to go listen\nTo the iPhone instead of the note is that what's happening\nAnd said no to Iceland stays well and then you and media audio which is like listening to lead you that one and it turns off the phone calls it comes in that's fine only get the odds you on\nAnd so the weight Bluetooth works a there are a number of profiles for different kinds of uses there's a headset profile which is used for phone calls [noise]\nThere's a a ... there are a number of different audio profiles must come and his aide too deep pie but there are other newer ones now\nA given the note eight in the age of it which is a year old is probably using aid to D. P. might be using ... but in any event uh that's for stereo music or audio of some kind so you can have one disconnect and the other one continue\nAre there different they're separate profiles it sounds like it does it not happen if the iPhone is in a different room are far away or turned off\nA little ah okay\nI mentioned the iPhone I was just I was just wondering if that was you had some hint that that was part of the problem so it's\nYeah\nAnd what that was gonna say that it and it petting device when I'm In it right now looking at it is you get you a hundred a shitty as it says ah on the nose ate it does call ordeal media due on contact access perfect color deal and conduct ... the media audio\nDrops out off the yeah you know ... yeah\n[noise] um all I can say is welcome to Bluetooth I mean there may be a cause there may be a cause for this but this is not anybody uses Bluetooth to listen to music\nKnows it's you know far from perfect I always prefer a wired in fact one of the reasons I still buy Samsung phones is they still have a headphone Jack thank goodness\n'cause it it doesn't ever drop out unless you unless you step on the court uh whereas I have Bluetooth drop out it's not unusual for me um [noise] so\nI don't I don't know what's causing it it could be an issue with the plant ... John in Florida who's listening says he has the same plant products appeared to a galaxy a seven and a windows tablet and he says I have also had the occasional issue I don't think the pairing it's two different devices isn't necessarily the\nIssue although uh that's because that particular device can do it a lot of Bluetooth devices you can always have multiple Bluetooth devices on a phone\nA or a car you know usually there's some limit but you can usually have more than one but it's not unusual for a Bluetooth devices to say I only will pare to one thing so uh but more modern Bluetooth devices will period a multiple unit so I I just don't know um [noise]\nI just I feel like this is kind of par for the course\nOr for Bluetooth that plant ... isn't the best sounding I Know you're only listening it sounds like the radio or pod cast so it's just voice but you may be that would work better if you got a a a better Bluetooth headset phone or something like that might work better\nThat plant products relieves intend to be mostly for phone use for a headset use [noise] but\nI I don't want to spend a lot of them I mean I bought the the hundred and fifty dollar um apple air pods right the blue tooth and apple even even sad you know uh and they put those out all Bluetooth we've got is you know so we had to design a special ship the W one ship that we put in our air pods and on our phones\nThat makes it easier to use Bluetooth and they still drop out all the time it's not at all unusual for me to be on a call\nUsing Meyer pods talking and all of a sudden nobody can hear me I Can't hear anybody I look on the phone to the phones taken aback\nFor no reason I think it's just a Bluetooth is not a very good technology and that's why I really gripes me\nThat all these companies particularly apple and Google and decided that the headphone Jack is superfluous we've got wireless what do you need a headphone Jack for Apple even added insult to injury with a new phones the tennis and the tennis max by ... by not even including an adapter [noise]\nThey used to at least include a lightning port to headphone Jack adapt or they don't even do that anymore they include a pair of lightning based headphones\nBut the presumption really is you're going to use Bluetooth and I just don't think loose ready\nThere are newer versions of Bluetooth Bluetooth five I think is the latest [noise] maybe a you know maybe I'm pretty sure that note eight supports it look and see what the specs are I'm sitting in front of a note nine but you know again one of the reasons I buy these things is\nGoing to say have headphone jacks [laughter] if I'm On a important call or I Want to listen to music I'm going to use the headphone Jack I'm On the airplane partly that's also 'cause then I can charge at the same time as I listen that's a big problem on iPhones see their war [noise]\nUm scooter ex says he uses his plan ... to twenty four hours at a time with this picture to X. L. while driving now do you use it for music scooter X or or just for phone calls 'cause 'cause that's that's our these issues that media music is dropping out on the phone call these phone calls and your work\n[noise] [noise]\nJohn's also pointing out the plant products does offer an app for Android and that might help also make sure you have the latest from where on your Bluetooth headset okay a couple of good\nAnd that's the other beauty of livings as there are many many versions hundreds and hundreds of them you can go to destroy watch dot org and see all of them\nAre the other one and I know I've never tried this but it was recommended to me uh by caller last week is called eat live and you get that at ... dot org and then it's also and I think ...\nIRS might appreciate it focused on that X right [noise]\nAnd I think that is one thing that Mac users maybe you're a little bit different uh they've they've they've based it on Debbie in a ... Debbie\nIn is my favorite kind of Linux because his community supported it is not owned by a company will boon to which is owned by a company's based on Debbie in men is based on a boon to so it's based on Debbie and\nTo removes a I think the same thing for a elementary owe us but he lives started with Debbie in and\nThey use the enlightenment desktop which is an interesting choice but they made it quite beautiful uh ... just looking at I I've I've yet to install it I'm going to have to do it but that would be one certainly to try and that's the other thing is great about when Nixon I Know you agree lazy 'cause easy to try him\nYeah and if it's got to live version then you could just food into\nThe U.S yeah all the Knicks has now become live versions [noise] so I Would in fact they even on the ... website they show it running on an IMAX so [laughter]\nYeah I take an old max and it's hard to get Linux working well I'm back in my opinion yeah you're better off\nDoing what you do which is by refurbished when ... you're dealt I\nOther great machines I mean they they go for like five seven processors they're like the machine she got a brand new but there to to you know three four years old\nIn a way with Linux you want it that way because the the as machines get older they're more likely to be supported you know it takes a little times of brand new machine often as as well supported by what next\nBut I Would I generally do it 'cause I buy you know one or two just for review purposes or one or two new windows laptops a year sometimes more when they get to be a year or two old just like you instead of buying referred by just take mine and I put limits on them I just put limits on my\n... a second generation of yoga and it runs view to flee the ex when yoga it's just a gorgeous machine made even more gorgeous\nMy favorite Linux the one I use personally is based on arch Linux another very good community supported distribution\nIt's a little different than Debbie and Debbie in is more stable arch is what we call it rolling update so it is constantly updated in ... that's probably not best for beginners a buddies is but I like to have the latest versions of everything on my systems that most\nPeople I talked to a all they want is a [noise]\nA rock solid secure platform they crash or they want some a a word processing and then\nThere's a free officers Lieber office which is really good and does look a lot like Microsoft Office\nUm the browsers at the same you can use you know Firefox or a chromium which is the open source version of crime and it's exactly the same as Firefox or chrome on a windows or Mac so they're ... they they generally the email is not what do you use for emailing for these people is there a particular program you like\nA well I used to love somebody\nBut it's pretty good I like claws but I don't know uh if clause is a good choice for novices I don't find that a a really good actually this is true on windows it back to frankly it's hard to find a good email program on any platform to be honest\nBut she found a good one night they stop and that's what's happened to Thunderbird great tragedy yeah\nAnd I've got why fight issues where I live uh because I live on a blog there's there's just two of us have a single family homes and then all around us for the last Thirty years have been eight six\nPlay up yeah and they all have wife find out they\nAnd they just stop all of our signal so yeah\nWhat I Do is I I have them by on a ... oh\nYeah those are very high end you're a geek so you can can figure him you know what you're doing\nWell also recently apple pie Lanka out the door access\nThe good too yeah yeah oh it'll transmit for miles actually Oh nice\nI've got to the door they look like little sectors and their seats so consumer coastal premise equipment so I can face it towards you know war is access point and I have no issues at all I\nDon't matter where I go and go across town a thing [laughter] and I'm now who is stopping on home access my [laughter] show you a lot of these\nPeople that live around me they they they don't know that there's only three channels or ... or ... channel on six and eleven so veiled channel three or channel eight they stop all over the band well uh I don't\nCare if he can hit two bands with one ... one of the reasons I like five gee you know most modern wife I routers will do the older two point\nFour gear hurts band and they will do the newer five ... it's been one of the reasons I like the five gee routers is it doesn't propagate as far as the higher the frequency them more easily stopped by those doors trees\nAnd so what I like one theory of this is that you instead of trying to blast your way to why five success\nYou make little pools of wife by that are only visible to you and anybody in in close proximity and you have lots of little ones is is the plume philosophy plumes one of those ... uh use and I mentioned\nAnd by having many little plumes one in each room one in the hall you can create little pools of why find the ... don't get interfered with\n... because the five hurt signals from your neighbors a hundred feet away aren't really propagating through your windows and doors and and nor you interfering with them and I think it's a much more neighborly way to get very good why five five years also can be very fast\nSo that's my my standard now for a for why if I if I if at all possible or I'll make sure I get five gee routers and I'll use a ... five gee that's probably confusing five ... hertz routers 'cause we're not talking five gee cell phone that something else\nHey it's great to talk to you as a fellow Linux nerd thanks league\nPhone number eighty eight eighty eight ask Leo website tech guy labs dot

we're very happy with them she's a heavy user um shows are falling constantly when she's at a particular time or whatever\nI let my phone go down to you know\nThe the ... solo before a charge it and um because I'm not necessarily a user of hers that I couldn't go two or three days with it anyway um I Know apple is offering a twenty nine dollar lottery replacement till the end of the year\nFor these photos um capacity is eighty six percent mine is eighty nine percent is it worth the money to replace those batteries\nYeah I mean you're you're in pretty good shape so when the phone comes is delivered to your door it's a hundred percent capacity that means\nIt in generally are all of the Maya batteries have a certain number of charge discharge cycles they can go through generally around five hundred so uh you know and a fraction of what your wife's doing a fractional charge discharge so she's letting it go down a quarter and charging it up a quarter\nFor those make one are you are more you know discharging fully recharging so you're going to get that five hundred times\nAs it gets closer to that five hundred and point it's going to get\nLower and lower the capacity at some point it's going to get so low that really won't hold that charge anymore and you will need a new battery apple had to do this they didn't want to do this they had to do it because they\nThey started pushing out software updates that we're slowing phones down with ... with their batteries were worn because they didn't want the phone to crash if there would be high demand on that battery and sometimes that does happen they say\nA lot of people said no it doesn't happen Android doesn't do it uh it's a just a ploy to get you to buy a new phone and in response apple said well All right we'll let you get a new battery if you want I think you recommend I think you're probably All right I don't you know it's that's a pretty high level\nSo I should show or a father of the ... not\nA good deal [laughter]\nBut I you know blacks is thirty bucks I don't think you need it\nIf it was a world don't fix it as you know\nThe old yeah and how much how many more years you want to use it as the\nAs long as I can I Love it I don't\nIt will it will get it back up to a hundred so maybe we'll add you know six months to the life is is that we're thirty bucks that's the decision you have to

I parents do not unless you get one with a cellular chip and sell your ship as a single chip that has both radios for GPS and LT\nAnd so that's the problem precisely is it the ... the er I pat I'm fact I'm kind of impressed the I've had been kind of figure out where you are it's doing that by triangulating why fi access points and if you get out in the country where there's no why fight you won't know where you're\nFrom once it a little slow sometimes you missed the terms before you really yeah\nWe're really in your phone is reliable because it's using GPS ... pet is not so\nIt does it does do location is actually clever a trick that ah ah apple uses Google used it was a company called sky hook that pioneered this they drove ... a lot of cars around with GPS is it said I notice\nWhen I'm Fifteen feet from ... pointe pay twelve feet from access point B and a hundred feet from Akron points see I'm here\nIn a mate literally made a map\nTriangulating all the Y in almost everywhere in the country and then selling that to Google and apple apple and Google Now do that themselves with their own cars but uh that's a very clever technology but it's not perfect obviously\nInteresting so if I bought an eye pad that has the GPS and a wife I ... you know it wouldn't\nBe a lawyer trick is your next die pat and good news apples probably coming out with I had this month for 'em get one within LTV chip then you don't have to be I mean you're still going to have to pay for an out to eat connection that's a pain for a but you'll have that way you won't have to pay for it to the phone for the data and you'll have GPS will be accurate [noise]\nSounds like a solution I thought maybe I was missing something a ... year it was\nYeah too bad it's just the way it is not a problem and the reason is Israel is right ...\nThanks for the call is very simple and to the to chip that apple puts in\nProbably ... was from Qualcomm nowadays I guess it's from into a is a dual purpose chip it does GPS and Internet or and so they just don't they just don't put that and now they're going to they're going to release I'm almost certain\nThere's lots of evidence that they're going to release new I've had this year probably knew I had pros or remember that Apple's latest phones all the phones this year have a new interface they don't have a home button they don't have a fingerprint reader their face i._d.\nAnd they have new ways of swiping and swooping in looping to control the thing because you don't have a home buttons you swipe left to go home and all that\nAh apple is going to inevitably move everything to the end of the first I think the first step there will be these new I pass it they'll release now we have an event no one knows\nThere's no consensus on this or they are also expected to release new Mac or platforms probably not the new ... crow but I Know you know we're looking for frankly a\nMac book air in a ... book replacement of some kind and uh that would also probably come out new air pods that that there's some evidence that they're they're going to upgrade the air pods yeah a partly because they've been deeply discounted\nBy a lot of merchants not apple but others that usually means rather clearing them out for the new ones\nSo it's enough new stuff they could have an event but I in my gut is there not it'll just it'll just appeared there'll be a press release\nMost people think it'd be later this month closer to Halloween but if you're in the market for an eye pad it would be prudent at this point ... or ... ... it would be prudent to wait till the end of the month see what apple has to say as usual we have to wait and they don't tell us [noise]\nUm let's see here that was a Dave in Sarasota wasn't it yeah now I blew it salmon west covina hello Sam [noise]\nTore Leo\nCome on over I'm well how are you\n[noise] um good good taking my call question though sure um I just picked up and I met congratulations on the law but thank you thank you so incredible machine or yeah um [noise] the feel my life so I don't know what the heck I'm doing with it [laughter]", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Savannah", "day": "08"}
