seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically want to blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're going to make it but yeah you're gonna make life\nMiserable so ah if you want you you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's gonna obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert in representing a representing a you know [laughter] it was representing their lawyers who represent warriors in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I watch uh oh and I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against these\nCrazy crazy complaints and a basic based on the handling ... advice I give because some people that took me to sleep and relied\nOn that anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize in this the first time out or when I was actually frightened nine now and bother so it's your call your call do I think anything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the white you were a notch\nA bean I you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily right there you are held anyway yes\nHi I'm\nCaroline God I hate these winds All right let's try at a let's start again\nWe just lost you know there shouldn't be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't work anymore in the last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send a guide to Mars right at some point as well because back he calls back All right oh hello Chris welcome to handle on the law Kris\nNew tax law that allows me to a ... tax return from Eighteen years ago [noise] it could get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or so I have no way\nOf contracting her and I haven't heard from earn like sixteen years I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner and espouse a ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there I remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules\nAnd now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nRisk yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve any way to do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the IRS on friday\nAnd that is ... yeah that's the way\nI'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up now I go to Mike counting Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several account and you make an important with the Irish and yet you might occur\n... that I actually find it might go and uh maybe a picnic or just magically appear\nNo no I I I don't know like I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find\nHer and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her\nAnd that's when I go out that many grand behind the counter right that's another issue and they made this and you and and you may be able to get the whole thing okay\nBased on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to half of that yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nYeah arcade cars and that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be around her\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rules specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone\nBooks thick with hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally supposed to be able to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously on fabric yeah All right so is there any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there is nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything\nRight also let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity\nAnd of course another hack this was Facebook fifty million accounts of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already and it just doesn't exist so\nUh I've been a customer of life walk and I'm suggesting you look at them to a customer for ten years and they've saved me from identity theft a couple of times will join me and my daughter\nAnd here's what they've done is they've added Norton Security to their program lifelike protects your identity Norton Security protects your devices against a virus attacks\nAnd if you have a problem with either one or they will work to fix the problem now no one could stop every cyber threat or prevent all id theft or monitor every transaction every business spotlight block with Norton Security that\nSome serious enhanced protection\nGo to white block dot com promote

twenty nine year old and a scooters coasts away under twenty five [laughter] maybe uh maybe Eighteen and under a but it's a great way to get around I understand that kids are really good at scooters 'cause they they grew up with those razor scooters my own experience with a razor scooters when\nI got one for my son when he was a little boy and a immediately tumbled head over heels 'cause it hit a pothole in a red over the handlebars and never did that again some a little reluctant I you know I like segue\nSuffer I've written a segment no cities have segue there too expensive to scooters are fairly cheap anyway San Francisco had her hearing undecided on to a scooter companies\nSkipped and scoot\nThey get ... permits to skip and scoot but none of the rest is the rest is Graham because we know that you know what I think that makes sense\nCities do that with taxis to right they say there's a certain number of taxis allowed to town otherwise the streets to be filled with taxes will be able to get around and I think if you let any scooter company come in and you'd get there'd be you would never you wouldn't be able to walk anywhere 'cause we scooters everywhere\nOn the ground and

Monday\nThe San Francisco metropolitan transit is ah the agency is gonna is going to allow this and uh the court says we're not going to stop it San Franciscans\nSays the S. F. MTA deserves scooters services that are safe equitable and accountable\n[noise] it is a pilot program I mean the theory is if this all goes well maybe more scooters will be allowed but anywhere where scooters are allowed to proliferate it's kinda like rabbits if there's just everywhere they're all over the place\nRight\nMe mood arch Arabs as his scooters or outlawed only outlaws will have scooters that is true yeah I I fix the banking hopping on the scooters after they're rubbery it squirting off\n\nA Google got a little bit of trouble I yeah I actually curious what you think of all of this Google ah got ... by the wall Street Journal earlier this week journal had found emails from Google executives saying uh there was a flaw Google Plus their social network discovered uncovered last spring\nThat allowed\nThird party programs to access your private information on your Google Plus profiled this is not your Google information is just just your Google Plus profile and mostly that includes you know you name\nAddress phone number ...

Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd she was on vacation about Twenty years ago his is a wealthy man he ... he retired\nAnd he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in the pool with some kids and when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just dropped the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nSo he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't want to come together so he created this water park\nThirty six million dollars in San Antonio and it's all twelve percent of the population has special needs in America that's not a freebie Oh yes\nAnd so now when they pick their big thing was that you know for kids who are electric or in a wheelchair that's powered by either electric battery or they have a breathing machine\nThey could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create a wheelchair that was that one hundred work wheelchair oh my gosh so they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp\nFor for ... with a zip line and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can\nDo is lined with kids in wheelchairs breathing apparatus that that is so cool\nBut you got to watch this video on creating a post right now I'm time magazine actually not time magazine magazine named one of the world's greatest places but New York times did an amazing video on it and now I'll I'll tweet it or put it in a ... in the chat room but this\nGuy is amazing he really is the guy should run for president United States but anyway um [noise] if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice on how to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh his line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a on a water slide wow\nA wine but you don't need to take the wheelchair on the line or do you\nI think you do so you want to share with them yeah that's interesting very huh so what have you heard of that out then it's such a neat idea Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio Texas for I just want it in a magazine ...\nThen you got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see that at least family I just that I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate I'm so he flew British Airways if a nonstop flight six hours or only sixty five people on or triple seven of ...\nAnd love it because then you could spread out in the face of its own roe [laughter] yeah basically he did and um\n[noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is um if you want to be treated like a celebrity and I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports but I see it all the time in LA when they department I transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and I did it's called um black lean pass lack of lame pass so black way I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now\nThey have this past where they had five hundred airports worldwide\nThey will scorched you so it was perfect for my mother in law because my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were playing the get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be\nFor a hundred dollars someone was waiting that moment she stepped off the plane so he got a website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time\nNo with no clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign with her name by they grabbed her bags they walk through they cut the line for on immigration so she'd have to wait an hour and immigration lines I\nDo that I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs\nAnd then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane or wherever you could whenever transportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's like that was the best thing ever 'cause I've been ... I've never felt like this\nAnd again so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to I Would do this\nFor my mom does not want to fly since eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly in her real fears that confusion once you're on the plane it's minus the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting washed or whatever so this will be a great\nThing what a couple of years ago I had my dad's life from LA he met me in Budapest he had to go LA London Budapest and I wish this was available I knew about it because I was so worried about him getting long lunch and yeah and yeah I\nI had he not oh I get lost in Heathrow it's a nightmare yes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families it's each the price of a difference but it's usually around a hundred dollars per person so it was a hundred dollars for my mother in law for that\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside on mash up and plume started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date won't want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links is router links is just [noise] wife their hand and said thanks good luck\nHave fun and so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say\nLook we ... you know we have additional features you could pay for euro are one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus\n... bucks and you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you get ad blocking and you get regular updates so that's something to be aware of mesh routers cost more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is the space\nAs a sport in our house okay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Savannah", "day": "14"}
