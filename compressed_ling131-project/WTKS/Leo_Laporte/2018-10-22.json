dollar dream system and they list there don't don't tell your kid yet but they list there all the parts you're going to need you need a case\nYou know the mother board you need a processor need a

need to get a power supply case usually has power supply built it so they it on their on these on the leader board they say well foreign fifty three dollars here's what you should get for two thousand a hundred and fifty dollars here's what you should get\nAnd uh it's a great way to get the kids don't tell the kid about this yet maybe if he has trouble finding it but say what what we need to make a

it\nThat's my whole life that's what I've done and I think it's great and I don't think it's a scam I think it's fine\nUh so that's Facebook and Google but then there are things like these survey sites and the the trick and I think I emphasize with dawn is they're they're gonna get something in return they're either going to get your attention your time that's what advertisers want your attention right\nOr maybe they're going to get your email address your home address something that they can use and sell your email address is valuable because they can sell it to other people to send you spam\nYou know offers for a thin line between offers and spam [noise]\nAh so that's valuable so what I suggested to dawn and I would reiterate is make a email address is not your main address that you used just for stuff like this spam at Yahoo dot com or something like that or stuff I don't want edgy male dot com that's those are probably taken but you get the idea\nAnd then you you need access to that account because a lot of times uh the very first thing they'll lose verify that address and you'll have to go click check my email ... so that's that's fine just understand that you're trading your time you're probably going to be looking at some ads that kind of thing\nAnd maybe you're going to get some money out of it a couple of people are chat room people I Know and respect like scooter extra ... say they like ... dot com P. E. R. K. dot com\nAnd you know you it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time and if you do enough of that they make money because they can charge the advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back\nWell of course you're getting one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side they're making money too that's a win win you know that's great doesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention\nSo it's important though to understand and if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game and this is this this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life\nAre now in a in the Internet\nWorld and they're ... what's funny is does the same games\nThey're the same games they're just changed the Nigerian prince scam things like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a whole bunch of new ways to play the game there's a wonderful book that I highly recommend\nAre called the confidence game why we fall for it every time [laughter] spy a wonderful woman named Maria ...

I Love I Love con man a lot of great movies and books about con man\nThey're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new kind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing your greed something for nothing so that's the that's the alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell\nAnd in general things like the pigeon drop\nRequire in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have a low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast and I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent\nBut if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever\nThey're going to get money out of you so all of these ... games in the long run will take your money but the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart\nAnd the the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook and you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to sell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter\nInstagram they're all free well but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies as expensive so what are they make and how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only because we have fabulous advertisers now I'm really careful we pick ads and advertisers that are products that use and like so I don't mind I'm happy to recommend like remote PC there's a good example\nHappy to remain recommend ... sees a wonderful tool very affordable and you get great value for your dollar it allows you to access any computer a Mac or a PC\nWindows or Mac from anywhere using a Mac or a PC or even your mobile devices that's very handy I Do a lot of tech support for family and friends that lets me I put remote PC on their computer mind\nAnd then I can log into their computer I can change things I can move things around I could upload fixes download files it's awesome great if you have a home office and you leave stuff at work and you want to bring it home or vice versa [noise]\nNormally very affordable fast it's efficient it's secure and it's only about six dollars a month for up to ten computers but right now I've got a better deal and this makes it really worth a try it's one of the reason I'm happy to get these guys on our show if you use my namely or check out that the ...

[laughter] well that's not the cameras name for sure so no I Believe she ... the gave it a name the J packed you probably know part of the name anyway um yeah what are we looking at we're looking at a black and white photo of\nSome mask\nThat has a ... you can see the front of a baseball hats\nOn it but it's all very out of focus very artsy very eye looks like it's probably been taken with a ... whole or with a with a lens baby or some weird lens that but I kinda like it it it this is not about the photo being sharp and focused Crispin\nColorful and contrast ... this is about the feeling that this conveys and looks like it's been shot on film there's\nScratches on edge um books\nYeah looks looks just it just feels right\nIt's really interesting it's perfect for dia de Los ... which is coming up looks like Dr ... mask related to that yeah and so every bit it touches\nOn the hat or thing just by having this\nYou know nowadays you look at something and you say well that could be a pinhole camera or it could have been taken with a regular camera and then filtered process [noise]\nThe way this this works jail metric plea with the depths of different different things in a different different total art I Do think it's probably a on a lark I think is probably not a a digital filter neat\nWell say anyway agree what else we have here well second one is by a user ... golden is G A you and I asked um doesn't have a proper titles and\nChris did a lot of that in there that I Do not like I went through it all the pictures I have one of the flick or the other day I made sure they all titles just because he good yes yes I'm so it's\nYeah what are we looking at looking at a little tugboat all sorts um but it's not just a boat it has a face an ad on I have no idea\nWhy you see it or you just obviously you've never seen\nIt's probably a cultural a pop cultural relevance to something in the United yeah but I Am not aware of how it all hang engine it's a kids' show oh it's from Thomas the tank I think ...\nIt ... it does it does it it probably that means it doesn't it doesn't click with me as much as with anyone who you're always you're not from around here\nBut it's still clicked with me because it's a huge and one\nLook at face it's cute it as a hat on [noise] so um I think the fund boat\nI like it to your door to see there is a bit it anytime there's Texas that picture I just make that the name of the picture so they that's what I Do\nI'm you know that's that's that's the simplest thing you can do for a making titles up your photos yeah think simple\nIf taxes in a photo as you said make that title [noise] um if something simple is on the photo something very clear is on the photo that's the subject of the photo then make that the title like twisted in the next picture oh in Boulder and has\nA photo of a pain kept and he called the photo pain cat it's that simple out so\nIt's a good one too I this is this is a bold pink this is a very pink cat I likely to end it there\nThere are several reasons why first of all just totally clear what this is about it a pink had um the cat is in focus its biggest in the center so it's a relatively simple photo there is stuff going on in the background in like a reception of some sort of people they are talking to each other but it's it's clear that the hat\nIs the thing that's that is is about because it's in focus and the rest of our focus [noise] um there's also a nice little color contrasting going on with the woman wearing a hat whereas a green dress or at least some greening address a green red is a nice primary color contrast and you can see that had\nBeen kind of look like it's like the windy so that gives its a motion with in the things that are on top I don't even know what you call those but\nStuff that's on hats you know [laughter] um yeah I like it it it jumped at me because it's so Chris clear to color is a bright and it was just a little cheerful photo of a hat\nI like it too it's like ... or something some\nEvent looks looks like high class you know as a classy picture a class I'm like you and me who are wearing our ...

T. M. I. L. L. E. hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV and me\nFell because that was not working anymore was getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the era was that age yeah my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know displaced so I'm thinking that might be something wrong with by age ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out believe you're going to spend\nMore money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub optimal solution anyway and it's going to break again\nUm there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com\nOr that they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise cam which is the least expensive but I've got these wise camps everywhere they're so inexpensive I actually have one pointing out a window it can then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to nest dot com\nGet a they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and you need somewhere to plug it in but obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras\nThey also say nest camp outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred and sixty five dollars from Amazon that's you know that's going to be less than ... than fixing that DVR\nAnd you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... uh two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what it is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well I'll give you an example\nWe were um we were in Japan or last spring\nAnd I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened at a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car ring or doorbell Oh nice she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was the\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\nTalk to her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record of that I Can't tell you how useful it is I have several outdoor cameras or we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio\nAnd it's and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a camcorder and the wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording and looping over and over again all of this is completely obsolete\nUh I think it's just nutty just to just to put any more money into it because I can guarantee is going to cost you more\nThan getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have wife by and you have to have power a you plug it in um it was pretty easy to install you know takes takes submitted to install comes with all the screws and so the other one if you want lights the ring dot com the seller\nI'm there and as I said they're spots of our podcast they sell a flood light camera that has a camera in slow like always work at night or the ring you have a microphone and speaker and an alarm that you can bring you could\nTalk to people if there's somebody outsiders store they because they get out of here your kids and that scares the heck out of [noise]\nHighly recommended Layla port the tech guy [noise]\nSavannah is news radio Ninety seven ... seven ... will Ninety am telling you\n\nHave heard me talk a lot

to create for it has conveniently for ports for different virtual lands and each one will have its own discreet connection to your cable modem they're all sharing that one connection\nBut they can't see each other you could then if you want to have for why fi access points each one attached to those and those would have different names and passwords for each tenant\nAnd uh they would then be securely a surfing so that's one way to do it a little more expensive one thing you might want to look at doing is if you're going to do that is use the ... to route ethernet cable to each tenants apartment and then connect the wife fight in their apartment which should give them better access [noise]\nUm so so you said with the editor at her ex that's just one device on\nRoute or all the white yeah then you need for why fi access points right ah and put them in bridge mode and they each have their own discreet Internet basically so it's creating for virtual networks [noise]\nOkay so that's probably the\nThat's the most secure fastest way to do it um and then it's more expensive because you got to buy for access points but if you're just buying why fi access points you're not using them as routers you can get less expensive ones probably under a hundred dollars that are just why [noise]\nOkay um and so another thought I had was just just putting out in and letting attendance decide if they're worried about the security\nThat's the other option routers yeah yeah that's the other option they can absolutely secure it themselves in other ways yeah [noise]\nUm [noise] so I guess\nHere's here's one thing you might get you you kind of do want to be aware of but one of the things he has read her ex will do it\nFor you is give you an idea of who is using how much bandwidth

mean a little I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make that clear okay are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am a no\n... what ... what are the minimum ... there's all the different languages like where you want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal I'm thinking about it but yeah I something on the side\nSo in the early days of the Web\nA Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at this what they call the source code of the Web page a Web page\nIs composed of a couple of different things HTML\nWhich stands for high protects markup language is the kind of the fundamental the ... language of a website and it's it's markup language which means that it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text should be a Talib size this texture be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise] ah\nYes yes that was added later it stands ... cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credit for it in a way it's like a mackerel language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website as you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we pushed it altogether you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in the ... we've gone way beyond that so modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier things animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language\nThat all Web browsers understand the job of script typically stored on the server as he is the HTML CSS and the data and by the way the data's usually store to the data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design today you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design\nA interactive pages the most one of the most popular widely used ... came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script but you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because\nFor years job a script was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with goer ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write a java scripts but if you but you need to understand those fundamental technology so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be ... by the way a great skill\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing job of scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those\nThe other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the\nContent is stored and the third part and often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web design if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you\nThe third part is designed you need to learn design you needed to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only how it looks but how people use it and we spent a court I'll give you an example here we spend a quarter of a million dollars\nFor my pod cast website which you can go
