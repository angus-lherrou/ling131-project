{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "And I think I I think with Sandra Tsing she's off the phone is I think she's trying to somehow rationalize away the fact that she got totally bamboozled\nAnd was immediately a versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... ... yeah I don't think so\nHi Mark yes oh I entered into a a settlement contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and then payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a new account specifically for those\nAre the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and then it was notified by the bank and sent in the mail a return on a stop payment on a second check\nOkay did you ... did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their heads gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a ... Noren you send it to all the different ...\nAnd ... how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or ... days or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know would they do and I just I ...\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job had insurance so we settle that\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nNo end to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more there's no question\nAnd then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost thirty mile OK but you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab your your your second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance you're canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh bye hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot hurting nine homes or we when we bought a house um where was given a excuse me a faith than are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot and what we can do with our home\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that\nEach of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer God for the city of Ventura or the city approve the flooding of the lot and now the developer is building two homes\nThat are in violation of that the sea and are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nThe record on who you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the age away also can control\nAnd they can say no more than one lied or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would\nBe the H away but you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney\nOr it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there and then in fact represent nothing but H always\nOkay so you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional homes that's big money for them\nAlright max\nHi good morning for yes or buy insurance claim a horse [laughter] okay but yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I never heard that one before ever ... much of that yeah\nThis is while asking [noise] anyway uh anyway they shorted me based on the estimate of the base committed they shorted me eight hundred Ninety seven dollars\nYeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go pound or that said that is anyway ah anyway what I did I filed in small claims court trade are there and maybe seven dollars\nAnd immediately they came with a check for five hundred banned the verbiage on the checks if I take a check or that negates credit for the claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I take a check\nBecause I Know a kicker button court if I take that check this out negate to\nYeah yeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would settle is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely okay so the only way you can go and kick their butts is to say no thank you to the Jack and boy had and file and small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm gonna go good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a\nJudge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of a a a judge or when we small claims judge which are usually not judge has a and daddy is and this happens all the time with big companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly\nHowever there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage like dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're going to lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing\nA dress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash the check [noise] this is handling [noise]\n\n\nThis is Michael met and here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide help folks maximize their benefits and\nSay honey what is it people need to keep in mind enrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less\nAnd cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks Mike this is Michael med bed for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty that's eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty on\nBut if that's the world they're growing up and isn't it sensible I mean that the wash I don't know [noise]\nThey also quote a guy named Jason top off he uh he ran vine remember fine and he now works for Google he says you know he lets his three year old play on the pad he says it's not worse or better than a book\nBut I Do feel he says there's a stigma\n[laughter] one reaction I got just yesterday was doesn't worry that all the major tech execs are limiting screen time and I was like maybe it should but I guess I've always been skeptical of norms people were just scared of the announce it is that's really crystallized the two points of view of the one [noise] and maybe it's a little school\nWhere we think oh you know if ... if you were of a certain age your mother shouted get outside and get some fresh air stop playing those stupid\nVideo games you'll ruin your eyes say remember this one you'll what are you going to do play video games for a living [noise]\n[noise]\nMy mom didn't say that 'cause I'm a little too old for that but I get that I remember those [noise] those shouts what do you go\nA and it turned out okay we had a a you know in my day was TV but as we're about kids watching TV I bet ya before that it was radio I I Know that when\nThe printing press in books became commonplace and they were very expensive early on but once they became affordable and people have them there were great fears that our children are ruining their minds reading\n[noise]\nAh because they weren't the using their imagination anymore\n[laughter] or you do all this time spent reading is is how is [laughter] keeping kids from\nWhat is it going outside playing and fresh air and ... and using their imagination well you know I guess it's maybe it's\nMaybe the caveman maybe the caveman said son stop painting on the walls get outside and find some meat\nI don't know\nThe quote Renee ... she's a security researcher on the board of the center for humane tech she says this is another out or you know option she won't allow passive screen time you know just sitting watching TV or\nPlaying a game but will allow short amount of time on challenging games she has a two year old and a four year old now wait a minute or two year old\nShe wants them to learn how to write computer code so she embraces their awareness of gadgets playing a building game I guess like Minecraft as elaborate watching a Youtube video is not unless it as as a family\nFrank ... who's a San Francisco based executive at the start up pebble post which by the way\nIs a direct mail advertising for him that the watches what you do online and and sends advertising based on that uh he says he limits his five year old daughter screen time to stuff in Italian [laughter] well that's you know it's a good way to get the kids learn Italian\nOr beer he said this is again the New York times article we have friends who are screen abolitionists and we have friends who are screened liberal is one that we have terms for he's read studies at how learning a second language of the young age is good for developing mind so he makes his daughter watch Italian language movies and TV show\n[laughter] [laughter] um you know that's\nJust to me that's like it's okay she's learning Italian what do you think\nI I Am so glad that my kids are old enough to think about it or I Am or helping to raise a Fifteen year old in our step son and uh he spends a lot of time on the screen like hours a day playing games on his computer and if we said get off the computer he pull out the phone\nBut I you know it's hard for me to criticize what I'm standing right next to planned pokey mine go on my phone\nRecently I got rid of Twitter Facebook Instagram

air and noticing the world around me I just found a game so I could at least it makes me walk\nAround there really addicted but I think that that's you know I don't I don't know if the devil lives in our phones but I Do it's pretty clear that what Silicon Valley has gotten\nVery good at is creating content\nWhether social media are games that draws us in engages as and keeps us coming back from

X. I. F.\nThat whole things like the location data that's turned on a date and time of capture\nStuff like that and there's an even further standard called I. P. T. C. that is a comes from the wire agencies that can allow you to do even more data titles in ... and all sorts of stuff there's another uh\nYou know a ... there's other information in there besides just the photo like I see see information so all of this is a is great uh information and most photo library programs will automatically import that data and use it\nYou could sort by date and so forth sometimes if you've got tags and there you can do searching\nI met her I don't know have you tried photo me\n[noise] a\nTry this one it's free so I like it it's from Germany and you know the Germans do good stuff well if\nIf I Would like to I went through ... and I cried about a dozen of them so I very well\nCould you might have it it's fairly old one I haven't used it in a while but in fact I think I hate to say at\nThe end game in that might be for windows me which would be a terrible terrible thing [laughter] I don't know what I what I typically will do a is do it within light room 'cause that's what I use to process my photos and it has gives you access to all the ex if a data alive\nI own light room I guess one of these days I'll have to learn how to use\nThat kind of a a ... a a Canada shoot a horse fly I [laughter] I don't think you need to just for ... anybody in the chat room have a a a favored or exit editor I Would try this photo meets photo meat dot D. E. M. I've also used\nI'm trying to remember I don't think I've used on windows it might be on the Mac but there are a number of programs that let you quickly import raw images cause light room is very bad at a raw and I've used a program called fast\nRaw viewer and I'm pretty sure yes for windows as well now it's not free but I'm pretty sure fast raw viewer will also let you modify the uh the taxi ... tags in there\nSo you can try before you buy it's fast raw viewer dot com and that is kept up to date that is a very up to date program\nAnd the reason I like it is because light room is so slow you know my raw photos on some of my cameras or forty two megabytes they're very very big files and so a PR image so it takes a while for white women loaded and debris split fast reviewers designed to really get you to quickly go through your photos\nAnd uh and pick the ones you like but it also gives you full access\nTo the P. T. C. and the access data so I think that would be even though it's not maybe this is the problem is that we keep you listing is specifically ex if editors\nBut almost all good photo processing tools I think will also give you access to the access information\nBut I guess I'm gonna have to break down by camera they only digital camera I got to ... you\nKnow there's ... there's a look at J. pigs as well yeah it has batch editing of I. P. T. C. data one of the things I use\nThis for is uh I like to put in\nTo all the images I import from my camera I like to put in my name address you know copyright information stuff like that and this will do it in a batch format so you can have a standard kind of tanks that you put in try fast rub your you don't I don't think you have to have raw files to to use it\nUh and it will let you do some sorting I Believe by tags by ah by the tanks that you put into the access so that was one of the things you wanted to do that's another one too so there's ... there's the uh\nUh what was the forgotten the name the Emmy program phone I mean is it I Can't remember now and uh and then fast Ravi were photo me is photo me that the cars from Germany and fast raw viewer\nAnd anybody who has a suggestion you could call or you could put it in the chat room or you can go to the website tech guy labs dot com and add it as a comment\nOr just you know you could just it's free to comment free to visit\nTo say I have an answer for James I know\nLet's go to Rhode Island Chris is on the line hello Chris\n[noise] pay ... Rhode Island nice to see you welcome [laughter] your memory sure it is\nYeah yeah it 'cause it's nice on the iPhone because uh it's\nIt's there before you get into it and and at first responders know how to do it the problem is there's so many different Android phones and the rules for how to do this very depending on which Android phone you have I think that is a big deal\n[noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on Android and are there in the early days [noise] uh\nYou know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you this will depend very much much Andrea they have Samsung's for instance have owner and owner info section\nThat when the phone is locked will scroll across the wrong and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happened you'll notice there's medical information\nIn there and then you can also a set ice emergency contacts I think that's their by default and Samsung phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the lock screen message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing else\nPut a a contact phone number because as I said the first responders that's the thing that they tell me that there and if you're a first responder uh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really want is that emergency contact number\nSo at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a phone number and people will know what that means is the first responders will now and if you don't have to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Savannah", "day": "28"}
