mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them right now\nTo be but it takes you know you have to scare somebody a trick somebody to do it but there is a little loophole here bad guys are always looking for flaws security issues not just with the operating system but with browsers and anything that goes on line\nThings like the adobe reader this is or do we flash these are well known issues so in the past they've all been patched but if you're not doing the patches you might still be vulnerable those in the past adobe flash had a bug that if you uh\nYou know had a ... actually this would only he's a W reader instead because you see PBS all the time right and you needed there'll be read it or read PDF files and so it's natural habit there'll be reader on your system\nBut it turns out they're bad guys who discovered multiple flaws and uh do the reader that allows them to create a special PDF normally a PDF can't hurt us about a program but this special PDF can because it takes advantage of the flaw in the reader to execute a program\nOh sneaky now how do they get you to do that well they don't have to get you to do that they just put that PDF on a Web page you go to most browsers will automatically load the PDF automatically call it there'll be routed to display the PDF and boom you're infected\nPick completely without any intervention on your part you don't want that\nYou want a bad guy to have to trick you at least to make it as hard as possible\nSo you've got to have pet everything that goes on line you're operating system your browser adobe reader do before anything that goes on line has to be patched has to be fixed because the minute the patches put out bad guys go aha there's a flaw let's see if we can fight it and you're much more likely to get bit\nAnd they can put these they could put these exploits they call them these these these these\nFlaws on a website you might even go to they can imbedded in an ad or they can hack the website websites can act on time put there and you just go to this you're going to perfectly benign website\nIt in the background without any intervention or visible display on the screen it loads a

have a question they claim that it's free why for unlimited devices but then they say they throw in a like a hard line I'm\n... and I don't quite get what the heartland far I Know I have on that the house and I think if I send my router that helps all my wife I trout\nHouse I don't watch hardly or is it faster speeds do I really need it\nIt's just cold or the you don't have to use it it it just comes with it so your your service comes into the wall with a hard line right\nWell that's what they have a a they have like what would be an outlet for a\nYou know and it comes in and comes into the cable modem which turns the signal on the way\nBut what what do you mean it came\nOn who's your ... what kind of what kind of service do you have is it is it from a phone company from a cable company who's who's the Internet service provider\nThat's what I Need help with I don't know well it's off\nThe icy I don't I see so they the office the people who own the building said and we're going to include why we're going to clued Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they are getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits at that faster oh and some devices require not everything has wife five okay\nSo that's kind of normal to provide that okay you have a Jack you have a Jack and what we call an ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nBut that's what I ... yeah yeah that's exactly right thank you for that\nYes okay that's called ethernet that's uh that's always nice you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nTapes rally in the shack I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nFloyd I'm In a so that's the question asked the landlord ... thank you for throwing in they'll jak which is connected to nothing [laughter] I thought that\nWas to you ask them do you provide Internet access almost certainly they don't I mean it's possible why it's pretty typical though when you read office space\nThat that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that his wired the ... the place up in in by Internet from them\nOkay ... okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my I'm a start up company do you think it would be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nNot so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away is not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have we in our building for instance the studio I'm In right now\nWe have the local cable company wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called ... that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say\nThis one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which to what am I choices if the spectrum you could add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise] usually\nCable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections that homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know that they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nOr do you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and uh and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was but what is available to me on that jak you put in my office and then\nI bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said you know what we're going to pay all the tendons Internet access most likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would
