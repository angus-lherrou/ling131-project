does is Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay because something somebody is making a mistake doesn't work I mean for\nThe new the new and said what we bought it and so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true bond that what they called me I don't know\nIf I Know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ... collection is\nOkay have you ... have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yes absolutely\nAnd it will go on and it's still on the credit report\nCorrect okay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or or as I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against me and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports that that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years\nOf dropping from the credit report and what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone by as crazy all I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients who had ah the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example when on paper to ... a credit card or any written a contract and a credit card agency\nOr collection agencies and some of them are real ... agencies have called and people know there was a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years to go there is a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they change the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients said okay just send me just give me the code just told me don't tell me the number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh oh\nYou know that's sort of thing kind of horrible ruled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole is I think it's going to be a huge huge\nA new area of the law dealing with it already is a pretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit but it's a it has to explode just has to explode\nRight Paul Paul you're up welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old in a clothing store and a credit card on the repairs camp [noise] who walked up to the girl checked\nThe items uh she checked emitted something I'm not sure what she did she handed the garments doctor she went and tried in Hama parents want him to step device without the back cover and its laughter scratch your leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches blue or anything there\nI mean is there anything there are I mean he told me about the scratch or was the was the femoral Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more of a the stress and we went through we\nAll know no ... no one cares about your stress that vote\nFor an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor HP ... wait a second\nAn aids test because one of those security devices scratched her and you did an aids test\nWell how many people many others got scratch but how do we\nRight okay so you did the age test and of course came up negative\nYes okay now what that is why I'm asking you know\nNo matter of fact there is not good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the AIDS or ... yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there's I mean theoretically now did you go to the doctor did she get stitches uh yeah the emotional ... there's not an ... an emotional issue when you get scratched [laughter]\nSo no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is there I have my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where you'd default to how do I get money\nHow do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what ... what happened and okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught uh I'm Upset because odd I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because we might anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case\nOh why not adding is high Agnes welcome to handle on the law\nI think if I sure do I get a pop or um I have a like a fake test that I don't think I can what less than half hour and they kept me seven hundred and Ninety nine dollars I Won that that I have a right to add family investment\nFor what I mean how much would you pay them and how do they do\nI Know but how much do you think you should pay did they fix it or not\nI think that ... less than half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they're fixing half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you a an estimate they already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they did they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they hinder do a bill for eight hundred dollars\nYou know there are no nothing already than just don't pay I go then\nWell then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's ... they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so I and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claim spending on the judge show a you wanted to its worst something Agnes right the work they did\nNot know what do you think you should pay I don't know much about it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they're going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say is too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I think the ... and then\nWhat do you mean you know did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash no no I didn't my credit card okay so you have to prove that you paid them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying it's too much\nAnd you and you want your money back and the overcharge you okay and you didn't know the overcharge you until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollar she agreed they're going to lie about it ... and you're going to go to court until a judge okay that's that's all you can do\nThat I Would be if I got a call ... you you have to ask them first okay\nIn fact Tuesday is patch Tuesday\nLast Tuesday Microsoft said All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and the surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out\nThe new feature update they call it Eighteen own mind 'cause in the September twenty Eighteen except it's October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine last one was Eighteen of three\nBut it came out in may so eight five but I but any ... pay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most important thing is is it you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows ten remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship all windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year\nWith these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying whoa that feature up I stole the feature of the delete it all my documents one guy on the Microsoft\nSupport board said\n... gigabytes of documents my documents folders gone\nOh\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested as as they have in the past with millions of people\nThe current you know eight you know not has been tested for six months work their tests and the next one already with these people who volunteer maybe you're one of them it's the windows insider program\nYou'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer\nSo maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly high on no anyway Microsoft and they have pulled back Eighteen online\nSo um\nYou won't be able to get a teen how nine if you were all excited about it [noise] probably few people have all the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't going to start kind of\nSaying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version of what has one installed they until Tuesday until patch Tuesday so that people who got what Microsoft calls seekers\nI Am a seeker I'm a secret truth of wisdom end of windows updates and I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything new it would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it\nI installed it on at least three\nComputers Lenovo that I have in front of me the AT T for Seventy yes\nLast year as a laptop I installed it on a surface go the new little mini surfaced at Microsoft put out a couple of months ago I saw it on my big surface studio the on one no problems as far as I Know no documents to lead\n[noise]\nBut to some people didn't have that problem not unknown why hope you didn't and don't worry Microsoft is pausing they say that's the word they're not pulling it back then that withdrawing it the pausing pausing it\nNothing to fear here [noise] ah we had the iPhone announcement that's usually the big fall announcement right in August Samsung announced the note nine very nice phone there's another shoe to drop\nTypically in October Google announces new stuff and yes Tuesday Google as having an event in New York City hash tag made by Google\nThere's really no I think there will be no surprises here we've been looking at the Google Pixel three leaks have been coming up for months\nI just read a review of it a review of it it hasn't even announced yet apparently a Hong Kong or retailer had one and sold it to an end\nGadget reviewer and so he's reviewed it it's pretty clearly the you know the real deal is very nicely package saw in the self worth or nothing nothing to see here it's nothing surprising\nWe also I think get a new chrome or west powered they're going to call it all the leaks say pixels light it will be a tablet you can add a keyboard to a pixel book

I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other team east right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or if there's a better brand or main\n[noise] yeah this is a\n... or the most optimal things to be the wire the whole house\nHorse but who's going to do that nobody was on the addict yeah yeah of course yeah I\nI keep I'm tempted to do that in my house in the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces enemies but then who wants to go into their that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so or or or worse\nThe cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended\nThat this was a requirement for them to and took advantage of and they all went digital or\nYou know there's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more channels of cetera et cetera et cetera\nBut of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your going over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or ... you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be challenged\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stuff but there's a lot of offering\nYeah what you'll notice on why fires the farther you get the less signal you get and throw that signal you get the less speed you get it's a direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal now uh it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point that has to do Lebanese see\nAre you [laughter] you're ... Mike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent or make it by its how recently a decent\nLife by it's not the FSL um it's just that uh they also have the the the lock on that as well we're very rural so the only choice we\nHad oh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend and most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife five router\nI did I did do that\nOkay good so you what if they if they're cable modem has a wife I a part part of it you know a router part of it just disable that or at least turn off the wife ... radio\nIf you could turn off the wife ... radio that'll eliminate signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we call bridge mode say let the cable modem router because there's still a router and they decide what IP address as we all get but I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why five routers um erode sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from net gear a veil up\nFrom is that links as I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things and these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the onions and then they have sub units\nTypically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more and and these these little extra units are are like repeaters but they're better than\nSo you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system but what will happen\nTo get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I'm In my brain doesn't work right now I'm working on probably three brain cells\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain so a lot to make an excuse for\nDo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the ... six\nSix December and that's part of my problems to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but hey\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or\nIs it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it like okay so on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down\nBut on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all okay\nSo it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest way is of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out you know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones\nYou press in hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time\nAnd they'll put you in recovery mode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacture and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what that what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it and they're you know just kind of at the same time\nThe volume up button and you have to you said volume up in power at the same Iowa yeah and you can you hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then press the power in volume button together and you'll see you should see on most of these phones they text based menu that the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume button up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset\nAnd a reset will just to raise the phone take it back as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nIt did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I haven't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nFor in a perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow zero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down\nA ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook to your writing it right but as long as people aren't going\nTo have to get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually it yeah here in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up and get a new book I I've actually less I've actually seen these in I'm\nIn the like the targets and stuff they [laughter] this is I don't know if there's a good idea but I see no books as they pass words on the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no but but maybe don't have one that says pass to get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd any time you said a code a password whatever\nJust write it down okay that's your password fall\nThere was a second issue with them is they always want to keep up dating\nJust the apps that came with it right and they only have\nEight eight ... gigabytes of hard drive space and only one gig of memory and I'm always getting low memory and out of space\nMemory or every time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes it's ... I'm Sorry yeah and that adds up over time when you're getting a little frequently and so\nBut you don't want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as you have they done to delete it and they'll have not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to the amount of size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay\nIt does leave in downloaded folder of the ... the ... or the update that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically oh oh okay yeah I Know windows they always do that oh that's\nRight windows does not it as soon as you have a lot of room but Android understands it in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it doesn't you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to a thirty two gigabytes card\nOh well that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media any data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see of a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes\nAnd that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you again keep calling okay love hearing from you point the three fifty seven the other way FEMA our show they brought you buy carbon I\n... the premier data protection platform for business the powerful server backup and replication solutions businesses need a single source for their data protection so that if something bad happens you only have one phone call to make only one site to visit that's carbon night real time replication means\nYou're never Adel data and if something terrible happens you can get back up and running right away high availability fail over from the cloud even you couldn't backup and recover physical virtue or cloud based data\nOver two hundred operating systems applications and platforms and yes of course it's always encrypted carbon I a secure trusted provider with customer service that is award winning seven days a week\n[noise] check it out the carbonate data protection platform\nWe'll avoid the tech or more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Savannah", "day": "07"}
