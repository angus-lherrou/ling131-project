are they using how are they doing it and how does it work and this ah this this article\nI think you'll find a little more informative uh than the newspaper article about this um\nThey called last step the use of a deadly yeah it does is it occupies the line is such a way it and at the same time transfer signals to the yeah [noise]\nSo they they they they mentioned in this uh in a scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nUh this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques his bio feedback you

I Hope to one of the ... second\nMoments you'll get a lightning bolt I took ... uh no I took two hundred pictures or how to\nGet this one so I uh filled up part of my card [laughter] wow and when I came when I came back I looked at the moment there was the one photo that worked out so that was\nThat was just I'm so happy because that is a photo that ... this is something that doesn't happen you know that doesn't happen it won't happen I won't see something like that again in the rest of my life I'm pretty sure about that so\nEvery photographer I think has that one shot that was just perfect timing and what's good thing to remember is you had to take a lot of pictures to get that one I think that's awesome oh yeah I Love it very nice\nOkay the second one uh when I talk about is ... dot com slash zero to ... and it's a picture of camels in the desert in the sunrise then it it's it's a it's a silhouette\nAnd to the sun is just raising behind them between defeat of one of the camels there's clouds in the sky and\nIt it's just this kind of magical light and a magical moment and uh of course the things you have an influence over in a shock like this is\nThe time when you're there so we knew we knew when the sun rice would be a you have influence over your location from where did you shoot it so you have to make sure to to uh shoot this from Los Angles to to get a nice ... camels um you have\nInfluence over the focal length like how many millimeters to shoot I shot really wide angle because I wanted that that big sky in there you have influence over the exposure in this case I made it a a ... a silhouette so I\nChose the according exposure\nThere's little star burst which you know the when the sun gets these little this little star shape um you can do this by shooting with a very small aperture and the only thing you don't really have been twins overall camels people and where they are [laughter] or do you [laughter] I was ...\nAnd windows will have will do that for you it's an easy thing to do it a couple of ways to do it one would be to get into\nUh the uh\nUh ... windows recovery menu so while you're booting up tap after eight in the recovery menu\nYou'll click on trouble shoot\nAdvanced options and get into the automatic repair menu and then there's a tool called boot wreck dot E.
