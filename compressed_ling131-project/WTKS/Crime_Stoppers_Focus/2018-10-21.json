around with an expose backside\nThat's why after many years of traditional tie in the back hospital gown healthcare experts are pushing to introduce new gown designs that go beyond functionality and improve patient satisfaction chat Ross\nIs spearheading that movie is cofounder and CEO of care and where a company that designs health where garments his team focuses on creating positive and effective healing experiences for patients and caregivers\nWhen you think about historically scams kind of just had the standard exposed backside or functionality and being able to get to the body very quickly and being able to kind of helped her bedridden patient and\nKind of now as consumers they shouldn't is taking longer\nThan the hospitals are starting to focus on the pier should experience and patient satisfaction is starting to make an impact on decision making but I think hospitals are really become focused on improving the patient experience and that starts with a hospital gown\nBut we've seen in interest recently from different organizations places like Cleveland Clinic places like Methodist Hospital and suburban Minneapolis St Paul they're interested\nThat's Dr Deborah mall and associate professor of healthcare administration at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga and consultant for the health partners park nickel that health system in Minnesota\nThey're interested in how to make patients feel more comfortable how they make them feel that they have more dignity and feel more respected and so different groups of hospitals had been looking at ways to make the gallon still work as a gallon we still need to do patient care and we still need to have access\nTo a wound cleaning or a doctor's exam but also make something that feels a little bit more dignified and a little bit more comfortable for patients and for patients when family or or visitors come to see them\nA lot of hospitals are starting to hire\nPeople from the hotel industry for example because they want you to feel like a consumer or a person rather than just the patient I think there's so many studies about how patients happiness for example can impact your treatment and recovery from an injury or ...\nSickness Mullen says that while patients stay in the hospital for treatment or recovery it's important they feel respected uncomfortable but her studies find if there's one persistent flaw that prevents feelings of contentment its hospital gallons\nIt all came out of a patient patients making comments and focus groups\nThat they really felt like the gallon so that we use to made them embarrassed to have conversations with people because they felt like they were kind of see through and then they hated walking anywhere in the hospital and it's really important for them to get up and walk to start the healing process\nImproving the quality of hospital gown could even help prevent post hospital syndrome a condition that leaves patients unsettled and weekend after being discharged\nBeing able to have a gal that allows you to kind of feel like a person the gander stay so important I think a great example I like to talk about\nIs the color of gal so historically ... a pretty hideous print one piece of feedback weird some patients was right now we don't feel like we're part of the recovery process the treatment process we don't feel like with the team\nSo what will new hospital gallons look like Mullen says she after graduate students for ideas of a contest with patients says judges\nThe gallon that one was a gallon that wrapped around so it kind of worked like a rap dress\nAnd if those people who don't know what a rap dress does is it covers the front wraps around the back and then comes back around the front again and tires on the side and these students came up with this idea\nThat a darker color or something that was a little\nBit less trans parent as well as a little bit thicker fabric and the wraparound design would be the best for helping patients feel respected and modest\nMullen finds that new gown designs don't benefit just patience but the hospital staff to\nOne of the things that was really interesting about the research really was the fact that the nurses felt so much more like they were giving warm and caring and comfort that was really surprising finding\nSo if the old school guidance are so bad why are they stuck around so long maybe just inertia change is on its way\nOne common misconception I guess is that\nHospitals don't want to change and the hospitals like the gal that they currently have one thing that we've been really puzzled way I don't want to say surprised we kind of knew hospitals do want to change with the other products it created but the one thing that I've really been been really impressed by\nHow many hospitals you really passionate and excited about ... about moving forward and making a change and I think that kind of goes to show just outright industry is written in Beijing then how how ready prepared clinicians are also to make a difference\nIt's a process but like I said hospital gallons have unlimited life cycle [noise] I don't have that number in front of me that if memory serves it's about fifty five sixty five washing [noise]\nIf you think about it hospitals over time could get rid of their older gallons and replace them with the newer gallons and they don't have to

just diminishes the city manager and the\nThe fact they didn't want somebody who wanted the job and I think that's the most important thing that you didn't come in and they're probably that that didn't add to the resentment that they may have our little little bit of a an attitude that somebody might have had said the okay that this guy's got to be my boss for now\nYeah it's um you know part of my goal was um you know I've got two daughters and um you miss a lot of their childhood growing up and you know people don't realize\nI'm how we're out there too in the morning and you know you're in the schedules and I've been putting in Seventy eighty hour weeks you know over the years as a detective and I promised them some bad times you know and and so\nI had to get with them and say hey can you give dead you know another six months to a year to finish up my career and um they were like yeah go for a day and they're proud of me and and it's ... it's nice to be part of this community was nice to have the great relationship with your kids to sure sure there I mean at the end of the day that's all we have is our family\nYou know [laughter] that's true mark revenue with a series of interim police chief for the city of savannah but as as the as the mayor said when he when he penned the the stars on you and he said I'm going to call you my police chief\nAnd he's been he's been so amazingly supportive and in this guy is a machine and I I mean I'm Out there working all the time but he's out there all the time at every meeting I show up to he's there\nUm and I I don't even think he sleeps I I I don't know how he does is he is in in Maryland was the same way and for the you know these guys worked for pennies\nAnd they take a lot of criticism and but they they both my experience are they both genuinely care about the community and I'm yeah I'm just amazed that uh how how much this guy goes\nWell of course the timing was perfect mark when you're first week on the job was a little a little hectic\nYeah have you know this being besides all the major incidents that I'm befallen us um you know we had that the merger looming and and that was um it was worrisome you know I'm a you know I'm immediately met with chief Hadley and said these decisions were made by us but we have to carry him out and we have to work together\nAnd we have to maintain a positive relationship\nBut most importantly we have to make the public know\nThat they're not going to experience anything different and and we we pulled that off and it was it was a ... you know changing the nine one one system changing the beach changing the you know a calls for service um\nAnd we were there you know chief Hadley and I and command staff were there to the wee hours of the morning that February first making sure everything went smoothly and it it never noticed\nThe strike a midnight to you you were all Boulder the call center making sure everything was going\nFor ... absolutely and and the staff all our senior managers were there and ah and you know the public didn't experience I Need downtime and that that's why we wanted was to keep the community safe and that's the our number one priority\nAbsolutely a mark revenue with this morning the police chief of savannah and mark when do we ... the one of the things that I thought was interesting because you address ... a week or so ago and one of the things that you mentioned was\nIt's much different now being on the inside looking out because you had work of course you work closely with the savannah police department knew how good they were from the outside but you found out do have an even greater respect for him now that you have seen it from the inside well sure you\nKnow people they only get the snippet of a decision they don't realize all the decision making that goes into\nWhat we do and it's just like this a march fourteenth walk out\nYou know to some that's just a a Seventeen minute blip but to the police departments to the board of education police the planning and the and the careful thought that goes in to make sure everything goes off safely and without any problems there's a lot of work\nAnd and so they think we make decisions very flip Italy and without a lot of thought but I promise you there isn't a decision and even down to the patrol officer you know they see decisions that captain's majors chief make and they they think we just\nPull a trigger and that's a decision that we we carefully are thoughtful about every decision\nAs training training training all the time are are are guess last week on crime solvers focus was a jak Owens who was a ... a retired thirty a retired FBI agent who is very critical of the bureau for missing the Parkland, Florida situation or the ... the river things didn't get report even though they had had specific\nKnowledge of this guy and didn't do anything about it and he said that shouldn't happen again but he was\nHe talked about how how and and I know local departments don't have the budget to the FBI does\nBut he talked about their constant training they would go to court to go or wherever and they would run like seven miles and then they'd have to stop and shoot\nAnd you'd have to shoot accurately after running seven miles or so they emphasize that that that exercise the the other good you know being in good condition because if you're an active shooter situation the guy just going to stand there waiting for you to give it to shoot at it\nSure but what the public doesn't understand is you know police departments go through these paradigm shifts if you look\nAt our country prior to Columbine ... there was nothing like that ever before so now how do you prepare and trained for something that's a new event now is becoming a regular event so every officer in every department around here savannah police um ghost or active shooter training where we actually trained in the buildings we trained with each other we train with this school staff we train with\nWarehouse personnel so that we all know what each other's doing\nAnd um that's quite a feat to pull off with you know six hundred officers and all of this school employees and and then we also put all our officers through what we call crisis intervention training which is dealing with\nYou know Thirty years ago there was there was nobody knew what autism was nobody knew what all these um mental health problems we're now one out of a hundred kids I think it's a statistic that uh have autism or have some type of on the spectrum and are we as police officers are the frontline dealing with these mental illness as\nWell Mark revenue are our guests today he uses fan of police chief market there was that a ... and and I think it was brought to head even here locally they ... a few years ago after right after the I think the the beach bum parade sure that there was a there was a gentleman outside to the one of the bars and he had a mental problem and\nThe cop arrested him thinking he was thinking he was trying to get to doing something nefarious and then he wasn't\nSure and and that's the thing is all the public sees as the Monday morning quarterback then you know they don't\nRealize I'm you know all the all the training that requires and wait we've changed our entire um approach to these problems men and we're getting better but um\nYou know there's an old saying in in Japanese ... if you're only tools a hammer all your problems with like nails we have to get out of that mentality that um are only way of dealing with these problems as arrest in in jail and stuff like that and we've we've got to figure out is a community how we're going to deal with the drug problems and mental health problems\nI'm In and we need to community support well\nNot only that you have we had a Hillary Nielsen and with this corporal where Nielsen than a few weeks ago talking about the program that she heads up or or works with the community policing that you do now\nAnd and you know to look at it you know she's got a very cute little petite she looks about ten years younger than she is\nAnd and she is ... ... from head to toe a police officer and she got her start as an explorer opposed when she lived up in Boston and she went with the explorer post it with a with a police departments that oh I think I'd like to do this for a living\nAnd I I hear these stories all the time I had a friend of mine who's a judge called me the other day and he said you know gee if I was in court as a defense attorney and I'm One of your you know officers two years on the job he goes I tried everything to a\nRattle him he goes never did even look as notes he was he said he had the poison experience of a Fifteen year veteran\nAnd uh I bought that house rent and I you know one at one of the things I Want them to hear these compliments and told them you know how impressed I wasn't home prices is attorney was with his performance and uh I think we don't do that enough is to say thank you and good job\nSo that the police chief mark revenue here with us on crops operas focus this morning and and mark you when you came to the department the first thing that happened was there was a police shooting and people don't realize how dangerous that situation is and what effect it has on the cop I was glad to see if you live in one of my favorite TV shows these days is blue blood\nAnd they had a they had a ... an episode just recently where are the the young Reagan's a partner who is female head to head to kill somebody\nAnd there was no choice in the matter but she had this P. T. S. D. reaction I mean it was like she wanted to quit I mean she was she was in deep depression I'm Glad they brought that out sure\nAnd and people you know they have the dirty Harry image of police officers yeah but these can often be career killers if they don't get proper help a lot of officers don't deal well with the peak TST and you know we get them to counseling and all that but\nBut the public watches ease a crime dramas and they think oh yeah officers just run around and it's sad because it it's it's a no win situation for everybody nobody wants to take another human life and a lot of officers have been killed in that hesitation of it or not being able to do it\nWell not only that but in the situation that you know you can't talk extensively because it's still being litigated but this guy that this kid comes out with a BB gun now I had a C. O. two Bebe gun as a kid and this thing looks every bit like a twenty two rifle and ... and it's still dangerous I mean the ... the CEO do get Bebe gun is very powerful sure sure and it looks like the real thing\nOh absolutely and I'm you know we would encourage anybody who who in your interaction with the please not to uh be confrontational not to display a weapon not I mean it's um but nobody knows why these things happen\nEven even sometimes when when I'm a pulled over which I'm Glad to say is rare but I you know I carry and I could see I have my my permit and everything else but I always felt like I said you know I have a I have a weapon in the car\nSure sure and and you know that we encourage people do that you know when an officer or if you get pulled over for a minor offense or just a suspicious vehicle rolled on your windows turned on the interior lights put our hands on the stairwell\n... and you know there is nervous is is the ... the vehicle no such thing as a routine stuff nobody wants to uh everybody wants to go home to their family said so uh\nThat's something that uh I Would do to if I was you know in that situation yeah\nI remember this is a horrible story out of South Carolina about Fifteen or so years ago or the highway patrolman up there was was almost going almost going home from from duty was his last hour on the job stops the guy and he gets killed the guy got on the ... heat stopping for a for a tail light being out that was all\nAnd it's crazy what you don't know what's going through people's minds when this is happening again that they there was a catalyst event in their life typically and are they just react in this in this way that a puts the officers life in their life and Jay endanger inside\nMark revenue with us this morning he is a fan of police chief and we were ... as this airs is going to be St Patrick's Day markedly talked to a little bit about that next the news ready Ninety seven point seven and twelve muddy nobody gas don't forget to call your tips Lynn honestly two three four twenty twenty grump stop his focus be right back\nAre you tired of seeing open cracks in your sidewalk patio pool deck her driveway or you can surf the problem is getting worse and dragging the idea that you may need to replace it the for selling your home thousands of homes have some form a sinking are settling concrete because of continuous expansion in contraction of clay soil if you've got cracks\nAnything concrete or air pockets color country basements systems today look country basement systems uses patented solutions to stabilize and lift your concrete for free evaluation downtown two fifty and use the key word foundation\nThank you have to travel to New York or Los Angeles to get by caring columnist diamonds and I'm One of the designer setting what if I told you people from those cities came here for these it's going to be\nTo international diamond center welcome to the idea the prestige collection I truly breathtaking array of large mayor diamonds two parents up and pay for maximum brilliance and certified by the CIA in addition international\nDiamond center is one of only fourteen dealers in the world offering forever mark exceptional diamonds\nFeaturing magnificent diamond five parents including the rarest in those diamonds on the planet vi V.
