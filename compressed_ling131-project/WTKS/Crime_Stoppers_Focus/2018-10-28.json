the onset of a serious medical condition comes along so slowly that a person doesn't notice they can't look back and pinned down when it really started\nThat's how it was for a science journalist Henry Nichols about Twenty years ago Nichols says he'd always been an\nEarly riser but at age Twenty one things started to change he started sleeping a little more and then a little more than that before long he says every day would start the saying he'd get out of bed and within an hour or so it would be unavoidably falling asleep again\nIt's the word I use is horrific and some people say comedy that by the rate is by internal mental battle to try and\nMaintain a parent's isn't a let's say like a\nOr a tutorial which is how I was ... then went on to employment in a work place in the

can move to a cool place you can special ... she can slap your face you can play music and windows and all of that is just a moment tree risk by from what is this crushing imperative to to

dreaming sleep so it seems to create that circuit and emotion\nSee attacks generally last only a minute or two in for Nichols they calm usually after having a good laugh for others emotions like anger or excitement might send them to the floor after a year and a half of these symptoms Nichols finally got a diagnosis narcolepsy disorder marked by uncontrolled\nOh lapses into daytime sleep Nicole says doctors believe narcolepsy can be a result of our body's reaction to infection a reaction gone wrong\nNo clip food and also I mean to sort of thing you do develop it can hit at any age ready but as a peak in teams and uh so I was just a bit off of that population Pecos Twenty one\nAnd it triggered by the flu infection at your immune system takes out these bumps yourself and your brain that

are now a very sleepy\nState condition during the day and then they almost classic and some there at night time\nAbout two hundred thousand Americans have narcolepsy and sixty to Seventy percent of them have ... as well Nicole says more than half of them are undiagnosed but all of those who are most would probably have welcome to getting a diagnosis as quickly as nickels dead after only a year and a half\nThe delayed between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of symptoms for narcolepsy is about ten years or average and some people are waiting twenty thirty is positive I probably that the patient themselves as not pushing maybe they don't have\nReally severe narcolepsy they have now but I see but maybe it doesn't impact their lives in the way that it does rather say\nSome people do have ... you know but they do have knocked up soon but clearly much harder to diagnose because\nLook at the Texas so clear and so strange that it ... you know if you have ... in this paralyzing way if very alarming at least at the beginning and you're going to go to the adults are\nOne reason it takes so long to get a diagnosis is that most doctors don't know a lot about sleep disorders one recent survey shows that only a tenth of primary care physicians feel very comfortable diagnosing narcolepsy\nBut Nichols says it's better than it was Fifteen or Twenty years ago when doctors in training received only minutes of training on sleep\nSleep is low down and medical priorities is just were seemed to sleep effectively and what do you mean you know sleeping well thought out where that actually there are real rocket science\nThe brain orchestrate flee right for the things that can go really go wrong with the brain and then you call the ... so there's a bunch of really to sleep disorders that are treatable but still not recognized\nToo often I'm afraid because ... they said that primary care point I'm not looking particularly if a sleep disorder\nBut you know doctors know that many cases of narcolepsy are caused by your brain lesion resulting in a lack of a specific neurotransmitter there is no treatment to replace that brain chemical at least not yet in fact Nichols says in some ways treatments still looks a lot like it did eighty years ago\nVery strong stimulant in some cases yes if you exactly the same drug that was being given the Nineteen thirties the outfit go stand that currently physical sodium ... which is a very very strong sedatives love that you go from a sleep too much and what do you treat them with aps a knockout sedative\nNichols is also concerned about the increase in other sleep disorders which he says or at least in part the result of too much artificial light the body hasn't devolved to stay up at night the way we do now\nYou can

so much riding on it and he's he's not there Monday morning quarterbacking you he's he just they're saying you know what do you need me to do you need me to go stand over here you need to use water for you guys he's just he's that kind of ball said that you you really hope to have and he's he's just he's just been so\nUm amazing really a lot of the progress is made over the years has been while under his command to include several record breaking breaking seizures that we've had\nHigher good people and then let them do their job [laughter] that's the best uh that that's the that's the trick yeah absolutely\nAnd then the other thing that makes the anti so great is that\nUh you know we're not simply run a road you know we ... where are the only that we're aware of solar cottage unit in the state that is a state certified so much like you hear other agencies that are accredited nationally credited as a process we went through so you know we we have our our policies and procedures check and balance through this um\nGoverning board that that makes it accreditation and says yeah you know these guys are doing what we feel\nUh should be done base of other agencies states policy and procedures\nAnd you know and then today the the director I can simply not just run into doing something um every department had the ... so\nThe sheriff's department all the other municipalities police departments all their police chief sit on what's called the ... board that meets a every so often and during that time throughout the writing will kind of brief all them on some of the happenings within the tea\nAnd take some guidance from them as well too so you know there's multiple checks and balances within the agency just to make sure we're not some rogue agency doing if we wanted to taking someone's doing because we feel like it um\nAnd keeping the money for yourself yeah exactly\nActually an gene Harley weather's of seeing the gene so if if you get officers assigned from other departments are are they uh how did they answered to their chiefs\nSo ... when their son of the anti\nMost of the times whenever there's an issue or or something that a chief may have with an Asian or he or she would take it to direct oregano kind of go through the chain there are one of the things I Want to point out though that one of the great things about seeing the two is that because it's completely is known entity one on one hundred percent funded by Chatham county is that\nAll the agents salaries are are reimbursed to the home agency by Chatham county and so that also does it it it it see that even a bigger one for the community 'cause only do you have this drug agency that that's that's really um huge and just do an enormous things by itself\nBut it's allowing these other police departments in some cases to hire more people than they could actually hire for that apartment because let's say for example Garden City for example\nThey supplied to agents to see anti that allows Garden City PT to hire two more all sorts of naked otherwise afford their overseeing to cause seeing these reimbursing their salary or or even a smaller ... for example who was maybe only has a five minute apartment they can hire six people\nAnd so you know it it allows these other police departments to to put even more people in the streets essentially\nWell this sounds like you guys are set the bar pretty high or that and it may be the gold standard have you had to have you seen the domino effect of this around the rest of the state of the country\nAre you know we have a one of the pleasures I have my job is that I I have to get phone calls from other agencies who tried to model after us because you know again in a lot of ways were made up almost like a task force but we don't want to use the word ... task forces especially means\nA short term fix right we have we have a mission we're going to complete it and then we're done ... and so we're constructing like a task force but but we operate completely different from one and so a lot of the agencies um throughout the state and even the country will contact us asking us to look at our policy and procedures\nAnd that's because of the name ... made for South especially throughout the state you know we we regularly have AC is calling us saying hey you know we had this ... going on in South Carolina Florida or off and on the metro Atlanta area\nAnd we believe this protest connection and uh we know about your gas we let apartment with you to try to help further the semester occasion and vice versa there's many occasions\nOne of the other good things that seemed to these great about it as we simply don't stop at the Chatham county line you know we'll go wherever the drug investigation takes us in some cases has taken us as far west as California sometimes even out of the state and\nIn this type of ... we partner with our local state and federal partners\nAnd we go we we partner of these other agencies whether they'd be in California cetera\nUh what do we need to do to get the mission done and then ultimately take those people who may have been never touch but in Savannah Georgia before yeah but they're supplying their drugs from California to Savannah Georgia for the purpose of it being distributed used about Chatham county\nAnd do our investigation and working with authorities in China in ... in California we will make a case against that person had them and died in Chatham county ... county to face the charges\nThat is cool so it can be absolutely I Would think that you would think that there'll be more municipalities that would want to do this around the country but I think it would also be a U.S selling job too because they do think you're going to become so there's rogue agency and we probably there was probably hard sell getting this one started\nBut you know ... and Nineteen Ninety four so we've been around for a good bit then and parts of that great track had other similar drug agencies but seeing the became so separate entity in Nineteen Ninety four\nAnd you know even with the other local municipalities outside of Chatham county we work very well with them a special effort him county sheriff's department Brian county sheriff's department et cetera because\nObviously you know we know that bad guys are going to stop the county lines that we have many no special partnering with FM county sheriff's office for example where\nYou know someone list is out of hand with ... and doing all their dirt as well as doing during Chatham county ... county so\nYou know and those type of ... will partner with ... drug unit will work those ... jointly and then working in a way which we can ask you our ... at the same time and and having those type of partnership is really a is a huge benefit not only to us but at the community because we're not just getting a piece of the organization here and there were kinda\nCollaboratively attacking the entire organization I'm ... and that's just it's great to see results in larger seizures are more U.S and and just really helps to kind of painful picture of what the organization was doing\nGene hardly with this morning from Chatham narcotics a team and a gene or is there a waiting list to get a ... to get on board with you guys\nSo well I think so [laughter] we we we we often have people who constantly trying to get on ... but the way it works as a for example the Chatham county police say say they have an opening then we'll put opening out through the agency says seeing Jesus that didn't applications\nGene Harley whether she is with a narcotic steam and a gene how did you get your start\n... yeah so um well first got into you know I can show you my mother never thought she had a brain surgeon [laughter] I can tell you that [laughter] she uh she said that she always knew that I Would be in a probably\nThe military and or law enforcement because as a child that's that's all I cared about\nAnd so ah you know shortly after high school went to the United States Navy force not there to to get assigned to a a visit board search and seizure teams so\nThose are teams you see on the news bored and\nShips in the middle of the ocean yeah and and that kind of further and train my whole interest in law enforcement and especially the drug aspect and so I came back after the navy and joined the that then former Chatham county police department right and um after about a year and a half two years on my own apartment during the patrol aspect\nThere's open at sea anti didn't really know much about it and um put application and do the interview process and was fortunate enough to to get the position\nAnd I'm so kind of from two thousand four on really been running gun in majority of my time was seeing the end you know just from two thousand four present day\nThe sea and she has a whole has changed dramatically from the types of drug investigations you're talking about two thousand four\nWhen it was a lot more common for people who stand on the corner selling drugs and to me would just be using a cell phone just kind of becoming more popular back then for people start using all mhm I'm so it was still comment for someone to be standing on the corner\nSelling drugs\nAnd so seeing team was asked such more of a war glorified dropout squad identifying this corner delis et cetera as well as then five people for selling from the house et cetera so now fast forward to present day um you don't see really that many people ... staying on the corner selling drugs right everyone has a cell phone now someone will not stand\nAway for a car to drive by the way down so the whole dynamics has changed and um luckily for me I've been in a position to kind of see that growth and change throughout the years and um you know we we have\nMany ... ways that we investigate stuff as the anti in a you know I could probably sit here and talk all day about just all the various types investigation she can do and and just how much has changed over the years and I'm\nI'm just so forces had been a part of that and continue to be a part of this this amazing agency that just\nReally doing so much for the community and and you know from the ... perspective I Try to do a good job putting out as much of the the good war see anti does to the to the public but I don't even begin to scratch the surface of all the the really great things they do because you know a lot of times one on one investigation\nFalls into another one to another once you have to keep the confidential for so long because so many ... how the domino effect and leave something then something else [noise] um\nAnd you you know ... ...\nAnd you know if I if I sit there and just in just bride every day about seeing the you know I can easily do it because these men and women are just I'm completely dedicated to to their mission to to their commitment to the community I mean I tell you the ... to see people come in like I said earlier in the broadcast\nCome in Wednesday morning thinking they're starting to know chef and then be working from eight o'clock that morning almost at ten o'clock the following night without ever going home to see their case for him and that's just really speaks to the volume of their dedication and and that's almost while they're not\nYou know I don't want people think seeing cheese I got to work in two days straight all the time but um you know that these men and women dedicated they'll they'll they'll come in early stay late Catholic changed your hours\nAnd um and you know they truly are the unsung heroes that you know the the the people in the shadows that that don't really get the recognition that they deserve but to be honest you know they don't want to you know 'cause they don't do it for that we definitely don't do it for the money\nTo understand that and and\nAnd you know but they they don't want it they don't want the recognition you know they you know a lot of times they'll get together and take their individual team photos and all that you know for for their own little team a building but um\nBut man just a great group of guys in and I'm so forced to be a part of it and and and so fortunately part of a a great ... command structure to that really lousy anti top right it does and that's really the reason why is as excess full today as it is\nDean early with us on crime shoppers focus back with more on see until after the break rich updated all news ... news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve money don't you take a U.S [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nLike in the long run to win on twenty twenty and watches the ... we don't want to know who you are or anything of that nature", "year": "2018", "show_name":
