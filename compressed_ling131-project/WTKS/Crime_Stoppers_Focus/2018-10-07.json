following up I'm a I regret that bill I'm Sorry to hear it for the bureau it's training and following protocol and I think of the local police know that they're training\nHas to be precise and it has to be it has to be fast in on time we can't sit on the information like this that's why we have a tip line sure we ask Americans to call of a sudden they do we have to act on it\nMhm in fact that that was the old monitor you know you hear something say something and we were so disappointed those folks out in California didn't want to be called racist\nAnd then when the shooting took place in Christmas in the peace loving Muslim or killed about Nineteen people in in his office and the people had seen stuff happening in his house in in the middle of the night and and they didn't bother to

they are Caesar's wives they are everything to all people and they're held accountable they do more crime scene and we do\nI work with a lot of police in Colorado in Birmingham they're terrific at their job we share bank robbery investigations with them but they can drop the ball the FBI and dropped the ball either we've got to work together follow protocol\nTo a Jack ... said things are so much different than when you served a there was so much more respect for law enforcement and of course when you when somebody said you were FBI I mean it was like you guys were absolutely above reproach especially in the Hoover FBI\nThank you for saying that bill I I notice that change\nFirst of all in the hardware we carried I started with I'm thirty eight caliber Smith Wesson mhm revolve or had six rounds and the chamber yes I did my career\nWith Fifteen rounds available to me and a six hour semi automatic nine millimeter we used to surround houses\nWhen I became an agent say FBI island and boring come out\nAnd the the subject would for usually\nCome out yet at the end of my career\nBill we were met with a fire\nFrom automatic weapons it changed a lot\nOf my book or factor would would have gone up considerably\nMore minded he\nEven now but there's a ... it's it's a shame about political correctness and when we mentioned you know the people didn't want to in this profiling stuff that that we hear now we used to go after the bad guys it didn't matter what color they were ... how much a born killer was over the other\nProtocol and training our mandate\nIs the bureau's destiny it's our past as well we take pride in it\nI took great pride in having the trust of the American people politics doesn't mix with the FBI or any federal law enforcement we have to act we have to obey statues follow the constitution agents are drilled in the constitution ...\nEvery day of our careers we have one agent in every field office assigned illegal matters in following Supreme Court cases we are held to strict rules and we have to follow them\nJak Owens is our guest here retired FBI agent thirty year veteran and he's also author of a puck ain't enough P. O. C. K. a novel don't shoot where Republicans [laughter]\nYes [laughter]\nBuild the bureau is a jealous mistress agents can publish so I kinda I hit a wall after Thirty years I wanted to writes I'm a retired so I could write my memoir of Thirty years in the bureau is don't shoot where Republicans\nGot a lot of humor and had been calls on force Monday at all levels bill is full and stock full of humor that is what a stress and law enforcement will do to you it it brings out humor and stress\nOh I can only imagine a and and the the the the stress do you have the jak if you had something like what what they are military experience has T. T. S. D. type thing uh especially if you've ever had to shoot somebody or shoot at somebody\nI Am I'm proud to say because it follows\nFBI protocol re rarely use our weapons I had several hundred rest in my career Fifteen Years on a SWAT Team was involved in putting down to big\nPrison riots or I did not fire my gun at any one and I even happier to say that no one fired at me that goal of an FBI\nCareer we don't use our weapons often but when we do bill mhm we fired for effect we fire a lot to maim or fire warning shots in the air we fired to kill\nIf you're going to use\nForce at that level you you have to I mean it has worked to save a life in their midst we can't miss and law enforcement we we we can't do that in our training requires that we\nHold the American people and keep them in safety\n... well Jay I'm Glad you mentioned that because it reminds me one of my favorite lines of all time was up to the press was getting on I think uh one of the I think he was a sheriff's evolution County Florida\nAnd they they had kept corner to suspect it wasn't given up and and he started shooting at him and they shot back at him and the hitting like sixty four times and the press has given them a hard time I said why did you have to shoot him sixty four times several ran out of bullets\n[laughter] well you know that's [laughter] that's that's a great line has any of
