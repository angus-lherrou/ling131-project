{"month": "10", "state": "GA", "station": "WTKS", "content": "In the seventeenth century in Switzerland that was a far way indeed when he listed out debilitated these people were by their illness and how somewhere near death and that upon returned to their home town they would magically perked up and be cured\nThat Susan ... professor of history at Weber State University she says back in the day the symptoms of nostalgia or home sickness were thought to be life threatening\nThere's a whole medical literature that starts in the seventeenth century and continue is even into the twentieth century\nOn how physically devastating styles you can be the soldiers as well as to any kind of person far from home and the symptoms you might have would range from dysentery to heart palpitations rapid breathing\nHigh fevers coughs\nSome people would literally die of ...\nThe sturgeon general in America during the civil war listed Seventy four union soldiers as dead from the ... and diagnosed over five thousand soldiers as acutely ill with it and they took it very seriously and America up till the early twentieth century it was a real disease\nAnd the medical wisdom was that it could devastate your physiology\nExperts don't consider home sickness to be a deadly illness today now they call it an adjustment disorder with symptoms like anxiety sadness nervousness and an obsessive preoccupation with thoughts of home\nMedical authorities don't the home sickness as is the ... debilitating disease does the in the way that they once did\nIt's not seen as dangerous today and in fact today when people say they're home sick it's kind of laughed off as this childish emotion\nThat he should get over by the time you're an adult so whereas earlier generations really thought it could be a troubling and possibly fatal conditions contemporary Americans don't have that vision of the emotion I think in large part because we expect people to move around with e\nThe reality is it's still not that easy to leave home and leave your family but people have learned to kind of Basque that feeling 'cause they know there'll be looked down on as immature if they don't\nA lot of people may think that way but ... says home sickness has nothing to be embarrassed about whether you're moving to a new place for a job or your child has just headed off to college Matt says anyone at any age can become home sick\nIn reality I think people are struggling with it all the time at all ages it's not just that childhood condition it's also an adult condition\nGiven how much our society moves from place to place in search of better jobs are better opportunities\nIt's actually a remarkably widespread emotion yet we are very reluctant to talk about it and I think the harm that come as a result of that is that people feel odd they feel marginalized sometimes it increases their sense of sadness because they feel like they're the only person experiencing this feeling\nAnd so I think it actually worse than the condition of phones because because people feel all the more alone\nIn fact that we might not want to admit it Matt says home sickness is something most people experience even if you enjoy new places and experiences the lack of familiarity there'll be intimidating but if you admit to being home sick then it becomes a legitimate emotion which often elicits a little sympathy\nBut I think it's remarkably common place and that lots of people if you scratch the surface will admit to longing for wherever they came from whether it's immigrants in your neighborhood or\nPeople who've relocated just across the country\nIt's visible and so many parts of our culture and the food we choose to eat and the sports teams we root for war and the music we listen to people are often trying to make that connection back to home I think is very widespread phenomenon in our culture but we don't feel like we're allowed to talk about it so\nI Wish we could talk about it more because I think people would feel less stigma\nIf they realize lots of people in America have experienced the feeling and in fact it's kind of a normal accompaniment to moving but because the brushed under the table people feel a little embarrassed by it in reality you know\nGoing back to colonial America I find records of the pilgrims being home sick it's about as American as apple pie\nHome sickness maybe an old emotion but Dr Chris Willard a lecture on psychiatry at Harvard Medical school says social networks and new technology may make it worse\nWell I think it makes it a lot more difficult to to detach so I think it's I think that's part of what makes home sickness probably even more acute for kids these days or you know for adults to be ... kids called our kids are away we're so used to being able to be attached all the time so it's kind of a\nDigital wireless ... court in a sense does the kissing connected\nThat our kids go off or as kids we go off to cap or somewhere else and it's not easy to get in touch with people when we're so used to that\nBecome much more likely to create or back home sickness even worse\nWill it agrees home sickness is a reasonable response to a big life change he says a helpful coping strategy is to express your feelings so people can understand\nWhy I think any time we get through a difficult situation but it just makes us stronger and so when one of the things I suggest that parents do is when there could have experienced home sickness\nBut they really talk about it on that drive home or in during the rest of the Arabic as it can become this kind of touchstone of your home sick and you got through it\nYou know during that two weeks time at camp so that means you can get through it if you go to a longer cap that means you'll be able to get through it when you go off to college here and another strange situation or our family moves across across the state or across the country or something like that\nSo it it does give kids confidence when they can get through something difficult like feel thing you know that which doesn't kill us makes us stronger\nAnd I'm like so many people that got through adversity we can start to see that as a strength and cultivate that as a strength and talk about it with our kids as a strength that they have so I really think you know in that sense it's overcoming something that can be really positive\nSo while it may not be life threatening home sickness is legitimate and it can happen to just about anyone when they're away from familiar surroundings it's the result of our instinctive knee for love protection and security\nThere is no reason to feel ashamed that feeling home sick because after all home is where the heart is our studio producer is Jason Vicky I'm Nancy

interesting that they they they reached out to you I think it's one one of the best things Hernandez has done so many years the city manager and the\nThe fact they didn't want somebody who wanted the job and I think that's the most important thing that you didn't come in and they're probably that that didn't add to the resentment that they may have are a little a little bit of a an attitude that somebody might have had said that okay that this guy's going to be my boss and for now\nYeah it's um you know part of my goal was um you know I've got two daughters and um you miss a lot of their childhood growing up and you know people don't realize\nHow we're out there too in the morning and you know you're in this schedules and I've been putting in Seventy eighty hour weeks you know over the years as a detective and done I promised them some bad times you know and then so\nI had to get with them and say hey can you give dad you know another six months to a year to finish up my career and um they were like yeah go for that and they're proud of me and and it's ... it's nice to be part of this community was nice to have the great relationship with your kids to sure sure I mean at the end of the day that's all we have is our family\nYou know [laughter] that's true mark rebut it with a series of interim police chief of the city of savannah but as as the as the mayor said when he when he penned the the stars on you know he said I'm going to call you my police chief\nAnd he's been he's been so amazingly supportive in in this guy is a machine and I I mean I'm Out there working all the time but he's out there all the time ... every meeting I show up to he's there\nUm and I I don't even think he sleeps I I I don't know how does it got his that he is in in Maryland was the same way and for the you know these guys worked for pennies\nAnd they take a lot of criticism and but they they both my experience are they both genuinely care about the community and I'm yeah I'm just amazed at how how much this guy goes\nWell of course the timing was perfect mark when the first week on the job was a little a little hectic\nYeah have you know be besides all the major incidents that hum befallen us um you know we had that the merger looming and and that was um it was worrisome you know um\nI you know I'm immediately met with chief Hadley and said these decisions were made by us but we have to carry him out and we have to work together and we have to maintain a positive relationship but most importantly we have to make the public know\nThat they're not going to experience anything different and and we we pulled that off and it was it was a ... you know changing the nine one one system changing the beach changing the you know a calls for service\nUm and we were there you know cheap family and I and command staff were there to the wee hours of the morning that February first making sure everything went smoothly and it never noticed\nYou know the strike a midnight to you you were all Boulder the call center and making sure everything was going\nFor ... absolutely and in the stats all our senior managers were there and uh and you know the public didn't experience any downtime and that that's why we wanted was to keep the community safe and that's the our number one priority\nAbsolutely a mark revenue with this morning the police chief of savannah and mark when ... ... ... what are the things that I thought was interesting because you address ... a week or so ago and one of the things that you mentioned was\nIt's much different now being on the inside looking out because you had worked recourse your work closely with the amount of police department knew how good they were from the outside but you found out do have an even greater respect for him now that you have seen it from the inside\nWell sure you know people they only get the snippet of a decision they don't realize\nAll the decision making that goes into\nWhat we do and it's just like this march fourteenth walk out you know\nTo some that's just a a Seventeen minute blip but to\nThe police departments to the board of education police the planning and the and the careful thought that goes in to make sure everything goes off safely and without any problems there's a lot of work and and so they think we make decisions very flip Italy and without a lot of thought but I promise you there isn't a decision and even down to the patrol officer\nYou know they see decisions that captain's majors chiefs make and they they think we just\nPull the trigger and that's a decision but we we carefully are thoughtful about every decision\nWell as training training training all the time uh are are guess last week on crime suffers focus was a jak Owens who was a retired thirty a retired FBI agent who is very critical of the bureau for missing the Parkland, Florida situation or the ... the rubber things didn't get report even though they had had specific\nKnowledge of this guy and didn't do anything about it and he said that shouldn't happen again but he was he talked about how how and and I know local departments don't have the budget to the FBI does\nBut he talked about their constant training they would go to court to go or wherever and they would run like seven miles and then they'd have to stop and shoot\nAnd you'd have to shoot accurately after running seven miles so they emphasize that that that exercise the the other good being in good condition because if you're an active shooter situation the guy just going to stand there waiting for you to give it to shoot at him\nBut what the public doesn't understand is you know police departments go through these paradigm shifts if you look at our costs\nDrew prior to Columbine ... there was nothing like that ever before so now how do you prepare and train for something that's a new event now is becoming a regular event\nSo every officer in every department around here savannah police um ghost or active shooter training where we actually trained in the buildings we trained with each other we train with the school staff we trained with warehouse personnel so that we all know what each other's doing\nAnd um that's quite a feat to pull off with you know six hundred officers join in all the school employees and and then we also put all our officers through what we call crisis intervention training\nWhich is dealing with you know Thirty years ago there was there was nobody knew what autism was nobody knew what all these um mental health problems worse now one out of a hundred kids I think it's a statistic that uh have autism or have some type of on the spectrum and are we as police officers are the frontline dealing with these mental illness as\nWell Mark revenue are our guests today he uses when a police chief market there was that a ... and I think it was brought to head even here locally they ... a few years ago after right after the I think the the beach bum parade sure that there was a there was a ... a gentleman outside to the one of the bars\nAnd he had a mental problem and the cop arrested him thinking he was thinking he was trying to get the ... doing something nefarious and then he wasn't\nSure and and that's the thing is all the public sees as the Monday morning quarterback then you know they don't realize I'm you know all the all the training that requires and what we've changed our entire um approach to these problems and we're getting better but um\nYou know there's an old saying in in Japanese ... if you're only tools a hammer all your problems look like nails and when we have to get out of that mentality that um are only way of dealing with these problems as arrest in in jail and stuff like that and we we've got to figure out\nIs a community how we're going to deal with the drug problem the mental health problems I'm In and we need to community support well\nNot only that you have we had a Hillary Nielsen and with the score permanent where Nielsen than a few weeks ago talking about the program that she had a bar or works with the community policing that you do now\nYeah and and that's it you know we're uh we're out there um I saw him you know captain hill with our um central precinct out there on the Segway rainforests park yesterday and making sure that I'm One were were present one more visible and one we're there to to talk with the community\nAnd and since then um you know I I I have an officer 'em out to poor\nI'm I've known since he was two or three years old and watch them grow up he was my neighbor and uh\nAnd I don't want to say I was the influence but uh certainly you know as he was going through college he come see me and said hey I'm thinking about going into law enforcement I said I'd love to see a work here one day in and he's been there for several years now and if you go it's a great to see this get grow up in ... and he's one of the best officers they have up there just truly dedicated\nWell I think it's wonderful programs have been my favorite cup a good friend of mine is a is a detective corporate ... and she's on the fourth precinct there the in the south side and and I talked to a ... about her one time says oh yeah she's tough she comes to ... ... is prepared she does her homework she is thorough and she gets the job done\nAnd and you know to look at it you know should become a very cute little petite she looks about ten years younger than she is\nAnd and she has no not cheese ... from head to toe a police officer and she got her start as an an explorer post when she lived up in Boston and she went with the explorer posts it with a with a police department said oh I think I'd like to do this for a living\nAnd I I hear these stories all the time I had a friend of mine who's a judge called me the other day and he said you know gee if I was in court as a defense attorney and I'm One of your you know officers two years on the job he goes I tried everything to a\nRattle him he goes never did even look as notes he was he said he he had the poison experience of a Fifteen year veteran\nAnd er I brought that officer in and I you know one ... one of things um I I Want them to hear these compliments and told them you know how impressed I wasn't home prices is attorney was with his performance and uh I think we don't do that enough is to say thank you and good job\nSpent a police chief mark revenue here with us on prompts operas focused this morning and and mark you when you came to the department the first thing that happened was there was a police shooting and people don't realize how dangerous that situation is and what effect it has on the cop I was glad to see if you live in one of my favorite TV shows these days is blue blood\nAnd they had a they had a ... an episode just recently where uh the the young Reagan's a partner who is female head to head to kill somebody\nAnd there was no choice in the matter but she had this P. T. S. D. reaction I mean it was like she wanted to quit I mean she was she was in deep depression I'm Glad they brought that out\nSure and and people you know they have the dirty Harry image of police officers yeah but these can often be career killers if they don't get proper help a lot of officers don't deal well with the pie TST and you know we get them to counseling and all that but\nBut the public watches these a crime dramas and they think oh yeah officers just run around and uh it's sad because it it it's a no win situation for everybody nobody wants to take another human life and a lot of officers have been killed in that hesitation you're not being able to do it well\nNot only that but in the situation that you know you can't talk extensively because it's still being litigated but this guy that this kid comes out with a BB gun now I had a C. O. two Bebe gun as a kid and this thing looks every bit like a twenty two rifle and it and it still dangerous I mean the ... the CEO to get a BB gun is very powerful sure sure and it looks like the real thing\nOh absolutely and I'm you know we would encourage anybody who who in your interaction with the please not to uh be confrontational not to display a weapon not I mean it's um but nobody knows why these things happen\nEven even sometimes when when I'm a pulled over which I'm Glad to say is rare but I you know I carry and I could see I have my my permit and everything else but I always felt like I said you know I have a I have a weapon in the car\nSure sure and and you know that we encourage people do that you know when an officer or if you get pulled over for minor offense or just a suspicious vehicle rolled on your windows turned on the interior lights but our hands on the stairwell\n... and you know there is nervous as is the ... the vehicle no such thing as a routine stuff nobody wants to uh everybody wants to go home to their family said so\nThat's something that uh I Would do to if I was you know in that situation yeah\nI remember this is a horrible story out of South Carolina about Fifteen or so years ago or the highway patrol went up there was was almost going almost going home from from duty was his last hour on the job stops the guy and he gets killed the guy got on the ... heat stopping for a for a tail light being out that was all\nAnd it's crazy what you don't know what's going through people's minds when this is happening again that they there was a catalyst event in their life typically and uh they just react in this in this way that a puts the officers life and their life in jail in danger and sad\n[noise] mark revenue with us this morning he is a fan of police chief and we're ... as this airs is going to be St Patrick's Day market life talked to a little bit about that next the news really Ninety seven point seven and twelve Monday nobody

twelve Ninety Seventy two guests will be having a great weekend if you're listening on Saturday at St Patrick's Day if you're listening on Sunday then yesterday was St Patrick's Day and hopefully everything came out okay we're talking with mark revenues of savannah police chief\nAnd mark I know as as years it with a poor police department and chief out there I'm sure you work with this amount of police on the on the parade is Natasha always tells us you know your volunteered you've gotta work St Patrick's Day you're on the police department so I Know you've worked together but uh now this year you're going to be that the man in charge\nAbsolutely and uh the planning that goes in and the careful thought you know people don't realize we want everybody to come we want everybody to have a good time we want everybody to enjoy the fact is we want everybody to recognize that the tradition of the Irish um and so all of that were very considerate and careful to preserve\nBut um some people take it too far and you know with the recent events in Mardi Gras and other festivals um we want to make sure everybody's safe and so what seems like a hassle to some people is us trying to keep people out of harm's way\nYeah and you know for for the crowd that comes in about two hundred and fifty thousand of our closest friends come to town and for the ... the crowd I think we have a remarkably safe St Patrick's Day I mean you hear about eighty three arrests and most of his public urine Asian or something you know it's something along those lines or or just somebody just had too much to do much to drink\nSure it's a last resort putting somebody in jail or that's the last thing we want somebody to have a memory of but uh sometimes they don't take that situation we don't short and we're we're left to deal with it but uh we want everybody just have fun safely\nBut you have a new national security issue here going on apparently somebody ...
