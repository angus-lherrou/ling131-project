model altogether and\nAnd now after Justice Kennedy retired it the way the ideological breakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him is Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance and\nThe whole process just isn't that sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for the chief will be to to try to steer the court drew the meeting or pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another part if somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him dear it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not the sweeping so that's one way to minimize the court throw a little bit\nThere have been other times and on on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that so [noise] you know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court\nAnd there are times in their big cases at the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have a choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary ... meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear\nSo you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted to them when they go through the confirmation process they have some visibility for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat as Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice to us I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold stances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he finds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with you know with a cross section of people in the court didn't than maybe slowly\nThat

joined now by Dr do this or law\nPsychiatry and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening that many people are highly tactic and what they do if their heart goes out for other people but they also take on that fat cat into their own body and a lot of their past traumas that trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre sensitive and started reading but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind\nOf accident and horrific situations where they take too much on in their body and they\nGo to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash and it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize that you are not that your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell and then kind of thing it and then some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system in the mirror neurons are the compassion there on the brain for I'm I'm past that fry at such an interesting on the stand and impact and thought that\nIt mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive and when\nYou know for instance if someone is on the tea scan and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle here on mirror neurons get activated that much more showing highly ... paper\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries\nIf you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all like ... patients has to take this fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant on ...\nStrasse negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to that so just take many fast go out in nature medics exercise Brandon laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas\nTriggered for instance you know the last year father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father's triggers so you have to know that different you know make a big difference that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current\nSituation [noise] um and also doing a lot to help nurture\nYou know do something really kind of yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear and then now is to go outside\nUh learn now is a complete sentence with paper because then you don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires people who are draining\nAnd now they're saying no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are that criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive people when you hear horrific things and the news you don't want to be around energy vampires who I write about who just enjoying your energy\nWe're speaking with Dr Judith oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical
