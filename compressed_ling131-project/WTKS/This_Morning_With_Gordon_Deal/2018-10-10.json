I mean thousands of people will till like that why are we seeing like\nAlmost goes from running around so there's gotta be certain aspects of that we were unaware of have yet to determine\nAnd a ... and really be quite honestly nobody knows exactly for sure we have our theories and that's all it is\nAre there any friendly ghosts like Casper or are they all tied the evil\n[laughter] well well yeah I mean what's what's the guardian angel what's a spirit guide on right now the ghost to maybe\n... I guess it depends on what a definition of the ghost might be I mean and if somebody sees their dead grandmother at the side of the bed is that a ghost or is that some kind of entity your spirit or or one of the same\nThe number one thing I always say that number one citing is is what I Believe is a messenger goes nuts somebody who is just passed away and they they come back to see how you're doing or let them know let you know that they're okay I mean it happened to my mom my mom didn't believe him goes or anything my dad died at a\nCompany I mean they're failing cookout never got to say

night you're talking about spirit guide a little bit and it really piqued my interest in about tonight I write interest is peak once again\nI'm actually had a question for ... sure um I've had numerous people throughout my life come up to me and told me there's something following and that's been what and they can never give me a straight answer I've always been curious as to what it is\nAnd have you have you felt that you had something following you\nOh my entire life you have from my from my early childhood I felt there is something following me I had an experience when I was about seven years old and my back yard my parents were both inside the house\nAnd I came in house screaming because some some thing set my name into my ear and it made my ear vibrate by said bring him so loud\nNow have you ever use elbow voice have you felt\nThreatened or do you feel secure with whatever into these doing this\nYou know it's kind of mix 'em at times I feel secure and then there are times when I feel like it I don't ever feel like it's trying to harm me but I Do feel like there's certain people in my life that it goes\nTry to act in ways\nAnd interesting what let me tell you in the in the short time we have left\nMy experience is that if these entities are hurting you uh the the I don't think you have much to worry about Maureen we've only got about thirty seconds left would you agree with that if he's not being heard that the these entities aren't out to really hurt him\nAbsolutely and I was gonna say George you get a great job because that was the same thing I Would ask because typically I don't think it's I mean what something is following I think it is someone\nUm and I think it's more of a relative it's like a guide and all that is looking over you know maybe there will be watching out for you and sometimes not as gentle when they speak with you but I don't think they're there to harm you\nAll right both of you thank you so much for being on the program

the people in stories that matter to you you're listening to America's first knew this morning with Gordon Deal\nWith this will come into Wednesday there are competing\nAdvertisements representing an effort to grab the attention of the world's most powerful TV viewer President Trump there's also a belief by Washington's influence industry that Mr Trump can be swayed by what he sees on TV here's what's happening from Wall Street Journal national political reporter Julie biker which Julie what's up\nIt's no secret that the president is an avid watcher of stock in particular and we know that because he frequently cleaning in real time and he watches particularly\nAnd friends in the morning and then also um during Hannity in the evening sometimes references Lou Dobbs them over at\nThe Fox business channel until the general public's notice and still have lobbyists in DC and lobbyist have found that effective way to get a message in front of the president is to advertise during his favorite TV programs so that's what we're seeing happen more and more\nWild ... like a fern what example whose airing what\nWill we took a look at the story now because there's a big fight to that's been going on over ethanol and so groups that are\nSavoring [laughter] you know President Trump increasing the mix of ethanol in gasoline has been um advertising a lot lately during Fox News programs and groups and also oppose that\nAre sort of counter messaging to him during the same programs\nIs you know to be influenced by the\nWay we can see is that he does sometimes directly after an ad\nThat pops up on TALK on this happened to win a group of a steel workers with advertising during boxing fans in March you know as the ad came up and the president started talking about the issue suggesting that he had seen the ad um\nAnd then sort of on the other side here if you remember last year billionaire Tom tire who's constantly and fights with the president and have started an impeachment movement I'm\nKind of was trolling him in a way by putting up an ad during Fox and friends and the president noticed that and tweeted about it right away\nFrom speaking with Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie bike which are pieces called interest groups compete for Trump's TV attention you know what to do that ad revenue for these programs that Mr Trump watches on the rise right\nThat's right and to not only is the president watching but the the programs himself have really strong dealership um during the administration the viewership has raised and and so have the ad rates [laughter] and ah we've actually seen some lobby from\nYou know notice that not only is the president watching these shows that people who are highly supportive of the president are also watching and so the thinking is not only to reach the audience of wine but perhaps you know out in the heartland Trump's base watching the same ads\nAnd maybe they will engage more on the types of issues that are being advertised about\nI thought it was interesting too you said that the strategy is also target early hours on MSNBC and CNN outcome\nWell although the president has expressed a dislike for programs on on\nThose two channels there's there's no debate that at least they're monitoring how those channels are talking about him and so the thinking there is that people who are influential with the president may see some types of advertising and and a flag it to him\nThat ah that that sounds I guess along the lines of what ah the guy Kevin ... from the group need to impeach how he feels like you just suspects that the president's watching and knows he can talk and it was like a little elbow and the ribs gone to bed\nExactly exactly um and then also sort of interesting to hear the president has been very disparaging of Saturday\nNight Live as a show that's not funny any longer and one that he says he doesn't watch but there's some evidence that he was watching and groups are also starting to put up ads during Saturday Night live as well\nAs Julie it's Wall Street journal national political reporter Julie by go with\nMore programs ... by white streams\nAre
