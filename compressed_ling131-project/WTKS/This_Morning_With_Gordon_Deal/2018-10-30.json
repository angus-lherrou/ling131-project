Julie biker which has been looking at the data Julie what have you found\nThat bottom line is that both President Trump and minority leader Nancy Pelosi are turning up in quite a bit of mid term advertising on specific to President Trump we found that he it's only topped by two other issues in mid term to advertising and that's health care\nAnd taxes [laughter] um so he wakes is number three in most common sort of the in the mid term advertising\nRight and then in terms of those themes he is portrayed sometimes positively and sometimes negatively\nThat's right and there's actually there's\nA surprising amount of positive Trump ads out there when he found that even I'm In a Democratic Senate at he's turning up in a\nPositive or supportive way and that set the scene and places like Indiana West Virginia where the Democratic senator is trying to hold onto his seat and said that Trump won quite a bit\nAnd twenty sixteen here type to the advertising like Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly thing when you heat for Hoosier time with him and another ad in\nWest Virginia has\nA candidate you know kind of say I work with President Trump when he does what's right for West Virginia so

difficult to find anything positive about Nancy Pelosi and advertising and that carries from not just a\nRepublican advertising but even democratic advertising that a little bit here and there during the Democratic primary races\nAnd we found that you know about nine percent eight nine percent of all ads out there have a sort of an anti proceed message so that really shows that Republicans have
