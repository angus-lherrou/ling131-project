bathroom a that once served as the vocal booth for um the doors when they used to a record there\nThey sing in the bathroom well it would have been vocal in\nThat and then they turned it into a bathroom\nBut uh you know their stories about uh the bathroom shaking violently when people were in it that it almost believes and people the owners thought it was haunted by Jim Morrison and\nYou know later I find these ghost stories about Jim Morrison literally all over the country I hit at his childhood home in Arlington\nAt a childhood home in in New Mexico uh\nBarney's ...\nUh in

morning we're going to be [noise] like walking into Monday fun to go behind the numbers\nOf the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at bank rate dot com work what's that number mean\nMeans that there's nothing to fear and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country for Eighteen straight months Gordon ... unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent four years ago the\nFederal Reserve projected a in a sense adjusted\nAbout project it back then that four and a half percent was essentially for employment and our country and been below that level for uh Eighteen months so [noise] uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strange from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers uh but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would have expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the are hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a widow or we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with more cameras senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report um\nDoes the wage issue remain a mystery are we\nJust kind of waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one that's an average right so that the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as a four informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience do you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian ah\nAnd nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is\nI fit as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well with it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector you're working so [noise] um\nFor the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh\nThe you know the question really ends up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth and expected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does it extend another words does it mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years or does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact\nOf but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impact of the tax cut begin to fade and twenty twenty\nI think probably twenty twenty as a date to watch when that happens to coincide ironically or perhaps not what the next presidential election\nIs Mark Mark Emmert
