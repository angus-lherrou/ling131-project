going\nAlong with ... thanks for joining us this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... distill the wall Street Journal Laura where do we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere at four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that is a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm I'm a little bit younger I even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adult I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the extra than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than\nUm with that said though I think that we are observing the market is a lot more interest rate a sentiment that it has been in the past\nAnd I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up in prices when rates\nLow and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the higher rates a negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they had to get their credit score up or something like that but there's almost no but he had a more or less a strong incentive to refinance [laughter]\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing\nAbove price growth is slowing and I am definitely sharing especially in some of the more expensive markets um but I went to some of the hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price production\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think that you bought a home good for you [laughter]\nI think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump within and rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prizes are still high but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted um for for a bidding war as in cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers who want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down were to bad I think it can be a good time to buy\nAnd he called daily pay and they said their views are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know in an expensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates end up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reasons for that I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some ... some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that's um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charged more so it's really about you know\nHow your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square\nUm and so now that those type of ... workers are used to doing that\nThat has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles um you know every day workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't the top and for me\nSo that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby your company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of\nThe national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that that the benefit for their workers some of these companies um are you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often\nSo we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nNext to

retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend Janelle how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts [noise]\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend to a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits news story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are notice and fewer teacher apps and says\nWe're speaking with ... to the wall Street Journal now if you were shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing they're at and hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minute today it just depends on where they were at\nWhen they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey when kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever and there are some states that still\nDo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to four day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\nYeah and that's always a big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discounted daycare and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the and the
