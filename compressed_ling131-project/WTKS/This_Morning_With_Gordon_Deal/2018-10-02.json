us prices for pork cheese and other foodstuffs here's Wall Street journal reporter Jacob bungee in Chicago Jacob what are you hearing\nGot to remember that but there's still a real tense situation going on with China which is as big a market as as a Mexico and Canada nearly in terms of agricultural X\nOr it's a definitely a big buyer of soybeans which has been kind of the root of a lot of the headache and the our land here this year since uh trying to put on those tariffs a couple of months back\nSo she goes a long way towards slavery said the remove some of the the big question mark round the north American market and then that is very important you know just the proximity let's\nSo much in the way of agricultural goods be exported directly across those borders in particular you know meat products so on but there's still a lot of question marks out there for the rest of the globe in Europe as as another one they've been working on\n'em and you know China obviously it's going to need to be resolved and for the time being looks like it's getting more tense and not want to so\nTo speak with Wall Street journal reporter Jacob bungee he's written a piece titled us farmers welcome new North American trade back I'm from a food safety standpoint what's new on that front\nWhere you've got here is not a a a massive change in the way that this is on but they modernize some of the language and and tried to standardize some of the practices across three different markets and as you can imagine this is a\nSensitive topic ah people not just the\nHaving [noise] why they have confidence in their own country's food safety assessments but also\nYou know wanting the most certainty that the practices in Mexico and Canada are going to be up to snuff and the U.S and by and large

out a bigger role policing some of these things which has its own debate but\nThis is why one of the key things worked out here and to to do with the food safety front\n... I think there was somebody in your stories of something along the lines that there seems to be momentum right now for the American farmer on the trade front is that that is that a widely held belief\nWell I think it depends who you ask and probably a how their their bank account is looking right now you know depending on on what type a proper or livestock they produce and how much they've been hit by lower prices but uh [noise]\nA comment about momentum came from a place where you know the farmers on the farm sector this goes for the agricultural companies to they've been watching but a year's worth the headlines are things that have been going into a direction where there was more a question\nUh in terms of the U.S and its relationship with his major trading partner is you know Mexico Canada the EU China and so on\nAnd uh so the reference the momentum there was a trade deal and an updated thing that a President Trump and signed last week with South Korea\nWhich is a significant market and then in Asia for us agricultural and food exports and uh\nThe the announcements with Mexico came before that a few weeks time and now with Canada looking like they're going to shore up the NAFTA or of an after there was\nAnd move forward or something and so that's the reference to momentum has been after you know quite a few months here of uncertainty where this all is going there they're seeing some resolution to some of these things\nAnd ...
