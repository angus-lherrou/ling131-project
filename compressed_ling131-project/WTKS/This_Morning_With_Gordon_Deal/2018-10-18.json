Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAre two issues than us direct way that voters could be a have a say in health care isn't some ballot initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah there are some of the states that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and this time um because because the governors in the state legislature there haven't done it\nBut are trying to to do it themselves they are and they're saying that they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expanded Medicaid to people the way of Obamacare intended to\nDo these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it [noise]\nWell there's a there's some some pushback from state officials in some of those states\nAnd one of the interesting things that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative include the way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government pays her most of the costs of the state does have some portion of the cars and in Maine which was the first state to do this to to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe governor there has three she has to go along in part because the funding issue so in Utah they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock by including a funding initiative along with their I'm finishing their ballot initiative from\nHow similar or\nThe initiatives that are going to be on the ballot in Idaho Nebraska in Utah\nThat ... the main threats as a saying that the Affordable CARE Act allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people out there are enough to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the funding element in Utah that goes along with that um this is an issue one reason it still I'm practically and as an issue and state that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers in the states that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all the federal money available that would help us\nAnd we're not tapping into it even though my tax dollars from our states are going to find these things and you know across the country one argument for why that is happening by mail initiative is there is neither conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public officials Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThe Affordable CARE Act but if their voters say we want this then there's other without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ...
