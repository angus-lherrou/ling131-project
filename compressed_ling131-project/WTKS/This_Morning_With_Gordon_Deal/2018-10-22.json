Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and had a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada um this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seems to be I'm a little bit more of a

are expecting their first baby I'm and making Merkel is thirty seven and I'm you know she's not the only woman who is now having a baby and you know in their thirties that's actually becoming more common than having babies and you're twenty\nWow so what's the reason for this [noise]\n... actually switched for the first time ever in twenty sixteen and they're starting to be more women in their thirties at and younger moms um and part of the reason for that shift on is that you know women\nAre getting married later in life and another major part of it is that teenage pregnancy rates are actually down quite a bit and so it's kind of the the mix of those two things that are contributing to\nI thought I saw that in your story which basically said like the rate of teen pregnancies from like Nineteen Seventy or the seventies has been cut in half from then to today that about ... yes\nYes that's true it's a way way down um and yeah that that get an education partly um plays a role and I'm abortions are actually falling as well so it's not just that\nUm you know there are more ... and it's happening it's um that there's actually a decline in sexual activity on the rise and birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and devices and things like that so it's you know there's also more methods of birth control that are available well\nWe're speaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Maria lasagna she's written a piece of data more American women are having babies later and some are still conflicted about it as you mentioned a there was a question or a survey that looked\nAt kind of the best way to get ahead and ...\n... your professional life having babies earlier or later\nRight exactly and um there's you know obviously it's a very controversial topic and\nUm you know you can't always control death and you know every woman's experience is very different but um yeah there have been sort of mixed results on\nUm you know if people should you know quote unquote should have children earlier or later in their career and you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women inside a woman who want to be a top executive should actually have children earlier about the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better\nUm and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought on that either that or children earlier when you yourself earlier in your career and then um you know when they're a little bit older you can really you know leaning so to speak and and really extend your career or you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having your baby when\nYou're a little more established it's better um but it also so much depends on\nYou know what your company maternity policy youth and all those kinds of things so um you know it's obviously a very individual decision\nLike Maria marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill among you thirty

decisions facing the central bank more from Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick tomorrow's Nick what's up here\nThat what the president has been saying about the Federal Reserve it\nReally doesn't have a reason for them [noise] us presidents have criticized the fed before George H W. Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last person to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president shortly to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened [laughter] trying to Ninety two [noise]\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been a kind of a difference in many respects the president and if another example he's saying things about the fact that he's blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy [noise]\nUm he said that they were his biggest threat to them and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said I'm a ... part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fad thought if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there was some fluctuation there about why he's doing this if you look at ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lever\nTo get to nominate the people sit on the board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of dead presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA boat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's into doing this just to kind of a\nRunning public criticism of the central bank and you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents for criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else\nOr as per usual when the president do something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n[noise] for exactly right [laughter] people are always going to talk in the markets about what the fed is too and but rather than Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look unemployment rate slow\nAnd the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as of a black disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but what ... what President Trump is saying here as well worth the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates [laughter] we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nSpeaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter who's pieces called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be caving to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[noise] that's right the question isn't very um difficult right now the most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates showed the decisions they have to make right now aren't particularly difficult but that may not be the case for a year from now let's say you're from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing to fall but inflation's maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tells you you should do and so the question is on the coasts call where you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look markets begin to question the feds credibility\nThen that's even worse and so it might actually from their back a little bit but the fed so far as saying we're going to ignore that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Savannah", "day": "22"}
