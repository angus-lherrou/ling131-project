seven and twelve\nAm Wu she tell you [noise]\nTurning down the noise you you are listening to America's first name\nThis weekend with Gordon the\nSpice for spending\nSome of this how cool would this have been back in the day of four day school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country so now hubs or the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for a day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we are actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty to state and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and what a from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical a situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts and it's still very dominant in rural districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation\nBecause everybody's really spread out and I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story and fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know they're noticed and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know in some of these districts they had already met the minimum\nUh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours that there is just\nAnd Canada than it is in the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because Kennedy was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses a for many years now\nAnd so there's a wider range of dispensaries there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [noise]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that um\nThat wider range of production ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply whereas here in the U.S ah you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana has been around a long time and again the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know\nThey have a very large legal candidates industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so [noise] you know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it may make things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you watch the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... capacity personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per eighth of announced that but the measurement a youth [laughter] whereas here in the U.S it's about forty dollars for an eighth of an out so you know for for allowing you multiply that out be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U.S I'm various you know from from city to city and surprisingly where was the most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U.S where where marijuana is\nLegal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having to you know set up a whole you know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and so that make things harder and drives up costs\nIf let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say all fifty states followed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYeah no so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the costs to go down pretty quickly because it'd be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level [noise] um you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nI mean we could we could you know get it from Canada worth areas is very robust cannabis industry already in place\nAnd we stick market watch personal finance reporter Jacob ...\nThirty minutes after the hour on this weekend\n[noise]\n\n\n\nYou know the person who wrote an article don't

the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could have been done ahead of time and then the decision could be reached a with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was Bible about doing so much damage so we pretty much get the same outcome um but but the damage to both parties would be added that ended the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been through a stage they reduce them and that's what a ... is really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provide you with the dice on how to resolve the problem and does show was out this massive amount of drama we seem to be enduring I'm pretty much every major decision\nRight so how could it potentially handle do accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that what it would do is it would go against ... and and certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had to complain that said that there was an assault attempted rape\nBut no rape jet no location no time no all the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had happened the day before that would allow prosecutor to bring the ... the case for\nWas named

and so it would allow they went dead at Senator Feinstein got initial no way back in July it would say okay it just doesn't make the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things before this has to pursue their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on to television itself eater reached the threshold or it does it eat the threshold limit doesn't it would've detail what you needed to do to get there and then if you didn't want to do it then that your decision you can certainly still go

the best translator in the industry it's it's a\nA woman who about translates international business conferences in Korea a and one of those people who you know you put the headset on in his simultaneous translation so so not only is she getting the words right she's getting the cultural implications right and she told me this is one of the most difficult\nA cultural things translate because as as horrifying is is that towns or in western culture it's not creepy over there um ... when you look at\nAll of the K pop stars and that's the you know that's kind of their their boy band

really growing you know we uh I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty to state and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know at the end though that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural district because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as fewer absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it and other unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or is that while you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know dirt notice and fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with ton al hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours\nAnd you know and some of these districts they had already met\nThe minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeded the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nNow does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon
