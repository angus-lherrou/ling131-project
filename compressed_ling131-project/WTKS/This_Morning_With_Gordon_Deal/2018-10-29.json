really talk about uh preparing yourself at night although I think there are other\nFolks out there who've written books about how to remember your dreams who do actually you know say things like you know\nTalk to yourself at night before you sleep and tell yourself you're going to remember your dream from but I think some people would say there are ways to prepare yourself but done done system is pretty simple just keep a journal under your pillow or on your night stand and right when you wake up\nWhenever it is right down on as many details you can about the dream and he feels that by doing that um as a daily practice\nYou'll get better and better actually at remembering Adrian Adrian sort of evaporate pretty quickly after we wake up right we remember them right away then we forget them but his his journal and technique he said um you know helps people remember more and more details as you go through the process so\nThat that is pretty simple technique but there there are there are others out there who talked about um dreams and dream interpretation\nThanks dug up going to take a call from a this is the first for me from volcano California the color is Brennan got good morning Brennan\nMorning with on your mind calling about is a sleep paralysis so I keep having these episodes where I'm I'm I'm I'm just a little bit I'm suffering from insomnia so when I get on these rules

they costly process but it's almost like I go into a different universe and there's always being that I see and usually\nTrying to get me and call me out of my body and not only that I can hear them they talk to me so I'm curious what your thoughts are on is this just on the loose in it you know much elucidate in like\nYour Internet or what Peter was saying that doctors will say or is this an actual dimension that\nDuring the state of my body is and I'm able to actually I don't want to say teleport but you know something along that lines into that because it's very scary actually yeah\nYeah yeah right at all I yeah I think actually recall you\nRented let's let's let's Christopher a response thanks Bernard for the call so does sleep deprivation lead to other realities I Wonder\nYeah yeah um well he mentioned the word sleep paralysis and he also seemed to I thought I heard him say consulting doctors or are we compete yeah there there is a category of sleep per hour from there are there are things that happen when people are falling asleep or waking up in the sleep ... thing is it's scary ... is a very common\nYou know people wake up and they can't move um [noise]\nYou know and it can I think I Believe it can be accompanied by\nSeeing things and and hearing things and so on so\nYou know uh get the question is you know is is merely a a physiological biological hum\nIssue or a problem um or is it somehow opening the spiritual world I guess my answer is I don't know I think that if you if you do look on line or consult the doctor they will they will tell you what I said which is you know these kinds of things happen and sometimes when people are awake there in a kind of an in between state of consciousness\nI'm you know that they'll talk in terms of psychology and neurology but um it it could also be um an opening to\nOther realities of their spiritual realities or maybe I don't know you know in some cultures um in some cultures you know people have visions um [noise]\nUh that that can be traced to you know brain chemistry or some sort of a ...

S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday\nThat's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages [noise] um\nYou know that this is a an order of magnitude that we simply can't handle when the uh you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight it's actually that's what's happening in I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise]\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package it has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know I'm sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that's put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome and Leo ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming he's got a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is that seem like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing you know a spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up and these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far [noise] were sent to the the mail through the post postal service and so um you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these packages go through 'em\nBut the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the volume is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's ... um you know the last in the last line of defense or those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities stop these also the private and private companies are I think it will really ticket ... these types of facts just\nGiven the ah I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nYeah I mean I Know that you know a Ted Kaczynski took Eighteen years to track down or where he was of course in those packages for of course spread out over much longer period of time and the one we're talking about here but I Do think that you know it's
