wants to hold on to the house if it's the last thing he does the retiring house speaker is hitting the trail for an aggressive final stretch of campaigning in an attempt to help more than two dozen vulnerable Republicans and save the house before he retires USA Today congressional reporter Eliza ... got the scoop realize what do we know\nHe had that really crack shine offspring he's like he's going to try to paint he's going to campaign for more than twenty five candidates a lot of them are incumbent who currently like can I can draw our\nIncoming areas helping their incoming Republican candidate like person trying to catch the because he's retiring\nWould keep this kind of schedule normally if he were seeking reelection himself\nHe always had a pretty aggressive schedule because he had to read them I could name for the party he trades that we're having a million dollars I'm\nNot quite a party with a lot of that going to keep peace candidate for ... ... he doesn't he's not running again I'm keeping a craft schedule but it is new for him ... sort of well you know basically like it\nOn multiple districts and just go kind of on a final spent that we should remember he's retiring and it would really help they'd like to see if the Republicans are able to keep the majority when he leaves\nLike geez I so I thought it was interesting too that he'll be campaigning at least for a couple of the house Freedom Caucus members then as you point out they have sometimes been a thorn in his side\nYeah this is really interesting as well I've spent\nThe last couple of years having the Freedom Caucus and from there and it has to be there for a truck conservative fire rate\nMembers of his party who will threaten or in some cases have actually legislation that as a Republican priority because they did not think it was conservative enough on Republicans need two hundred and Eighteen votes in order\nTo pass anything and they can do right now on their\nOwn um but they need dying from the Freedom Caucus because there's about three dozen of that so they have power when they started voting bloc and they've done and they've\nThreatened to do that and so they have sort of forced Ryan and his leadership team in a lot of cases so I was just surprised to find out that he is actually on the trail for three of them\nOne of them being a congressman Dave Brat\nWho is sort of one of the leaders of the Freedom Caucus said not just a rank and file member but he's one of the people making these decisions on what the whole thing getting what they'll vote for it but he's all three of them are facing really competitive races\nSo we're speaking with allies Collins congressional reporter at USA Today she's written a piece about how outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan is it in the campaign trail to help other GOP candidates that was kind of messaging will he have does or does it change from Canada to candidate\nSo it was kind of candidate a candidate what how do will change from Canada to Canada in some places that might be like a business or or you know a rally\nIn some places it might just be a closed door fundraiser it really depends on the candidate but his messaging basically it's like you're better off Republican leadership at the economy there talking about opioid legislation which is of course is actually very bipartisan push and absolutely groundbreaking\nThat the house and Senate were able to push this giant opioids package signed into under President Trump that Republican there's a lot of their names on these tiny tiny little bells all grouped together a lot of vulnerable Republicans had their names on those bells\nAnd painting and all of that but the message basically being you're better off Republican leadership and Democrats\nThey are going further and further last\nOr how will he use President Trump if at all\nBut I imagine it will vary by the district but remember he's going to need to really vulnerable districts on some of them even being counted out already by Republican strategist said you know we'll probably won't when that's on let's move our money elsewhere\nRent payments that none of them are counted out but these districts where the Democrat as and they can make strong place it's probably not\nJust tricks to align yourself really closely with the president in last year doing an event with
