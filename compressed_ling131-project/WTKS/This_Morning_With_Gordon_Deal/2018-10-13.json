Michael is also sometimes referred to as milk cheese a duck\nWho is who established the priesthood which Jesus was a member of\nThe other current or force is led by ... who was referred to later as the anti Christ and they were they were all of the belief that these two forces are currents are active in our consciousness at all times this is kind of the Christian concept of the devil on your ... on one shoulder and the angel on the other\nAnd it was all about harmonizing these forces and recognizing that through our the power of our own consciousness and our own thoughts\nWe can actually become angels\nIt's an amazing possibility or how did you uncovered this\nI've actually been on the trail of the watchers for some time I mean I've been of course on the on a knock you trail for Fifteen Years or so and then I started researching the Sarah from uh several years ago these are the highest order of angels and\nThey watch or guard God's throne and in fact during the ... so it was a belief was developed that the the Sarah from were actually humans\nWho would transform themselves into angels or perfected themselves that the book of papers describes the the heavenly thrown a God referred to as ... and they tell us that it's inhabited it's an inhabited by joyful angels and the angels are the lord the watchers and\nJust humans made perfect\nAnd I'm reading this I'm going well who are these people ... what did they know how did they perfect themselves how did they get to turn into angels and go into well in God's throne and can I how can I and that's what started me on this real path of of trying to uncover the secrets of the watchers\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I never knew I had my in my direction and I never knew there were only in my room and then in in my

TK\nThat their home and there's work where we spend a lot of our time\nSo of course these conversations are going to come up when you're talking with your colleagues even if you prefer for politics to stay out of it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too I think it was um a PR group in a like New York and San Francisco and there's actually a memo that went out reminding employees that they had like a handful of free counseling sessions or something right\nThat's right this is this company is called the ... offices in New York and San Francisco and partner at the company sent out a memo early last week just outlining the resources and benefits the company had\nTo deal with this uh and and what I thought was interesting that that particular company is that they set up a slacker him they'd had had to set up for the past year but the flack room was called hash tag resistance and it was a police for workers there\nTo really engage in these conversations without talking out loud so if people want to have political conversations at work they could do it in this specific slack messaging room\nAnd if they didn't want engage they didn't have to be there and so the person said about Fifteen employees were active last week talking kind of providing real time updates and what was happening and this was a good form for them to do it you know about\nThat well received with just cut her Wall Street journal reporter he's written a piece titled the capital effect political debates shake up the workplace\nI can imagine to some managers I don't know may not be versed in having to deal with politics of this type of a passion\n[noise] that's right I think some manager said that they felt that there was just no place for politics at work I spoke with someone he's the CEO and president of the wealth management company near Philadelphia and he said that he had to tell his his small team that there really is just no place for political bickering network\nSo he's often telling them hey Mr Smith is on the phone he's take care of him he's the one who pays your salary enough talk about politics here some have taken kind of hard line approach like that um I think others are a little bit more unsure about what to do some I spoke with said for instance if they're going to see\nWhat happens is weak to determine how they respond I'd want to see how their employees feel before they determine the next steps um but but one one executive I spoke with said that she found the best policy to be just having an open door\nJust try and she said it's important for corporate leaders to have an open open open door open ears open heart she wanted them to just listen to employees to be there if they did have concerns or want it to talk about politics and then we go from there\nHow much of this uh boils down to gender battles [noise]\nWell I think you can't separate them I mean I think that these are these are ... these are gender issues it but I think that we we heard on on all sides of this that they were men could have come into twenty support saying we're there to help you were there to support you and and so I think we talked to some people in the story for instance who felt that they\nDid not feel that uh just cat and I was getting a fair shake in this and that they were having those conversations so I think it really it cross gender lines across guy economic lines it was something that this was a very personal debate for a lot of people and and of course played out at work where we spend so much more time\nNext year but Wall Street journal

limbo crash that killed\nPeople in upstate New York last weekend just seeing that\nHeadline breaks your heart but for some people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by Dr do this or loss psychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's going on here\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly unpack and what they do is our heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness and into their own bodies and a lot of their past traumas or trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... survival guide about these people who\nAre so sensitive and so loving but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of\nAccidents and horrific situations as they take too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted or anxious or depressed and so it's really important to learn\nHow to set boundaries and center yourself and realize that you are not them but your heart and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anguish\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's sunny and I've done some research on this and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the\nCompassion neurons and the brain for I'm I'm past too that's why it's such a an interest in and out of the ... and an impact and thought that the mirror neurons to compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on a state to scan and in that you love and they're getting pricked with a needle your mirror neurons get activated but much more so and highly empathic people\n... so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or hear something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse how to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pass patients has to take news fast and not become addicted to the news because if you have that constant onslaught\nOf stress and negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to it so just take many fast go out in nature um meditate exercise ... a friend and laugh\nSo that's one tool but also just notice past traumas um\nTrigger it for instance you know if you lost your father and you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is triggers so you have to know that different now that could make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with this in addition to the current\nSituation um and also do a lot to sell nurture\nA week and by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets and and like pd um snow Globes you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands\nUm [noise] were first coming up late and these are just the sidewalk newsstands that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands I'm a new state and federal property you could only sell news and um it was even that was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties\nThe said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that a great them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and items that cost us for five dollars and now the console just about anything\nKind of food and beverage wise as long as it's packaged in any kind of like ... there's a lot of it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep the newscasts from competing with for front retailers for good reason um\nAnd then the city does have a law that if you're going to stand you have to sell ... and they actually said he told me they send out people to force at last but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some new standards will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or a lot a lot of space too I'm Simon newspapers because Americans are super low and they don't sound very much I'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and and so that things that have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre sticking with and get out of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the newsstands are selling\nThat you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back alive a long time before like you know ...\nCame and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers outlets fight it tooth and nail lemon and his fans come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of affection so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands officer to um [noise]\nIt was kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um\nOut the sides and backs of these stand for for um selling advertising for the city wants to make sure that that new stance can keep going it has an interest in making sure that they'd offer folding they want to keep us alive to keep that ad revenue coming in\nThis weekend's Jennifer ... with Wall Street

I I just don't feel comfortable\nLast weekend brought the smash success of a star is born the movie directed by Bradley Cooper a remake of the classic tale but in many ways\nThe film defied conventional wisdom in some cases going against that wisdom actively seemed to help them flourish in others it's simply didn't hurt the way one might have expected Steve ... at the Washington Post who covers the business of entertainment just either way why bubble producers should be paying attention Steve how do you see it\nI mean this is really one case of you know a movie star war in which you know in retrospect seemed like a membrane into a big hit of course Bradley Cooper directing it directing him self as Lady Gaga did a sort of buffalo business over the weekend I think we'll continue to do that\nAnd probably a lot of success of the ... of the opera and the road shows\nOn the line but moved to the film and about the project is that uh there's really no reason to think this would work I mean for them to really make you got to the movies any more movies for grown ups movies with our and about\nFranchising superheroes um for another lady a movie that's been made three times before admittedly last time back in the seventies but with a lot of success before\nYou lose your belt but we make a movie with will do well in the past because you're going to get compared unfavorably to that earlier version they bumped I Will too low during the sort of convention liberate the side and um ended up ... to ...\nYou know and that was interesting an interesting point about I'm not really making a movie that's already done well in debt that high bar right do you think you should be pick a movie that didn't do well because there's only room to grow or do it better\nWell that's what we know ... or ... years maybe more than a decade now that that it was just ... of course on television as well you said you know and I feel this way all of us have a lot of people do you think that would come back but if if you bring back the classics\nUh things don't look right unless it's really feel like maybe a little bits of been kind of a ... sort of ... versions of those earlier I mainly just do one had is that for one thing you know again it was back in the mid seventies or a lot of people\nAre seeing the movie route with Barbara Streisand Christmas of course obviously in\nA you know it was a long time ago and I was willing to change the music world\nThat uh misspelling documents you very much about a sort of a Mario cruise characters with our country Walker but when I was really a sort of pop superstar all the way to becoming that\nThat's a very different sort of set of musical circumstances in the seventies show you know what it is a civil we make it was a remake I think a lot to say about it and was informed to a great extent by what's happening right now\nWe're speaking with Stephen ... at the Washington Post you covers the business of entertainment he's got a piece\nTitled the seven ways a star is born bucked Hollywood's conventional wisdom and succeeded anyway or we were talking off the air I told you I just don't see many movies so I sort of near when I saw the over the weekend box number of of uh like forty two million I don't know okay whatever too bad I voted to\nEntertainers I like Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga oh well but what the number of
