somehow getting it over this huge trench in mound of dirt\nThey looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt\nThe two twin girls in the backseat looked like they were in their

oil and really far away and you know maybe I'm just imagining that\nSo I kept hanging out look at the stars in about ten minutes and they closed oh I'd say at least three to five miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psyche can personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me I jumped in my car so bad and got out of there\nAnd you know I

Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times Kim what kind of security do we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to a band aid security that we're really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't together sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aids by the way what's what's what's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's that ... prior to that extent it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um the server is like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe jets will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing that we know about that I'm also have a ...\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and I'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis defeat when the um the customer has at patch that system\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two dozen sixty election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet they think system could not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the Internet not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um water the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also used to calculate the vote so these are actually the most critical ... not the Internet they think that some\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do you walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence or are you saying there are there are some doubts about whether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our elections as needs to be hacked as a court glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented\nWere just addressing it now because of the Russian threat but um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want motors to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produced paper trail\nOn and they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't that\nYou point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nShow 'em yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines I'm happy to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um states the county election officials are not looking at the paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter that are in cyber security journalist\nAuthor of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of election security how do we get so vulnerable\nWe got vulnerable because

Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington to she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do we kept a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh it's done and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity journalists Nineteen Minutes after\nThe hour fortunately ...

and banks had made loans they thought would never defaults than repackaged image securities to make them seem risk list\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from ... is chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use it\nWe've got to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices\nThey essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of us bankers investors and we as individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations or attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's also been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting do your own household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't familiar we'd build one and a half million homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there are several rates for that one is that well I'm an Asian countries so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that the limited who could buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know used to try to hold equity loan to start your new business those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and deserve a psyche that it's just something they don't want to do\nSure you have your ... here and you're ... months there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nBut people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Coogler Facebook the level of new business is being forms actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially that people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nWe're speaking with Greg it chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or are they related\nI think it helps explain why the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean there's an old saying on Wall street a bull mark markets climb a wall of worry\nThat is to say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people forced to capitulate and fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nAnd that some of the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy projects are less likely to you got to bust into recession now that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off\nI don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer and I think those are the circumstances but up about which the risk of start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risque but kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it sort of like water running downhill encountered a barrier tries to find a way around it and and we hear that happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans that banks will make like to like heavily companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks are private equity funds so you in some sense still have risk out there is just informed that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\nWhich Greg Greg Ip chiefs economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can follow us on
