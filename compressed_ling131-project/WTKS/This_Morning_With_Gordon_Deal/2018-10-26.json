delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from guy to guy coming in but it it has been my experience\nIn the past that the delivery people coming in to office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day unless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know it may you know where's second such\nYou know if they said on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air sites I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah

Tucson\nTampa Minneapolis Orlando Denver LA Reno and Miami work collectively more than three hundred million dollars has been spent since Labor Day on broadcast TV by candidates it's a story by Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic part of the u._s._a. today network Ron give us some numbers\nSo Phoenix the to the TV market a forty one thousand ads on just broadcast television that doesn't include all the cable channels as well so it's even worse than it sounds\nA but we are a number one market in the country that turned out for a huge political ads and you know as I noted in the story if you think that it may be\nBetter in Tucson for example there are actually number three over thirty thousand so Arizona's really kind of getting bombarded with political messaging\nBoy and the majority of the ads feature what races you\nKnow the Senate race here is is really the big one a this is the race between Democrat curiously cinema and Republican Mark and mix Sally it's one of the last ... competitive wages on the map it looks like right now\nSo let's just recently bought well financed and uh had its share of sort of ugly messages from both sides but especially each alarmist messages from the mic Sally ally camps\nAre those are my layman's observation near the nasty\nOnes tend to get exhausting after a while our our focus saying to you that I'm okay enough already can we fast forward the calendar November six\nYou know somebody posted a great tweet on this you know practically begging for car commercial [laughter] I Know I mean that's what it's come to where we're just like we're we're tired of this\nPeople are like skipping TV they're just sitting it out for the next couple of weeks\nOr they're tired of this messaging it is you know no surprise the messages are almost overwhelmingly negative in all the way the Senate race in particular has been a pretty ugly from the start and uh you know people here have seen that across the board\nFor us this is a little bit different just in the sense that we're are increasingly politically competitive states so\nThis is something that yeah we see in politics get ugly bookstore but it didn't you know\nCar carpet bomb us this way now we are definitely seeing a lot more action on both sides\nWell respected Ron Hansen congressional reporter at the Arizona Republic had aids essential dot com they're part of the USA Today a network\nYou got a piece about how Phoenix has just been overwhelmed with political ads this election year um you mentioned to kind of more broadly this has been significantly sharper increased over the last midterm election was that the measurement\nYeah it's a compared to the terms even compared to twenty sixteen we're seeing a lot more action than what we're accustomed to and I think it's again a reflection of this stage growing political value or on the board\nOr Arizona used to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's so far lighters you these days\nDemocrats feel pretty optimistic about their chapters and a number of house races again the Senate races greenery too close to call and so we are just a you know inundated with these ads are overwhelmingly negative in a in a lot of different races a lot of different corners of the state\nKendall lower ballot candidates actually get air time or they squeezed out at times by the ... the Senate and governor's race\nYou know I think that they can they can get on the fact is that they just don't have as much financial power to do it so at any price they would have been relatively low rock came a campaign you know we have a Democrats running for example in in each house waves\nAre they are challenging guts move for us and ah these are some times low budget affairs are we even had some Republicans running in places where they don't normally rod ... so you know they are at least a contested leans races\nBut again these folks are are pretty far away from having a TV money at any great quantity\nAnybody saying that the saturation or perhaps consistent negativity can actually work against a candidate or is it a TV is king and candidates are going with it\nYou know look at people who actually hate negative advertising but the fact is it does sort of help define your opponent been so people still do it it's still leaves an impression with voters and the question is\nWhether there's enough there to someone down close enough that whatever you might be offering looks more attractive and and that's just kind of the tunnel model in politics\nIs Ron Ron Hansen
