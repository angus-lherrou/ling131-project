corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers or either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related use to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nWell you know there's a lot of a concern and in some quarters consternation about the idea that companies are you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always at ... they've always got a lot of money in Washington\nAnd in state capitals but the idea was that they would start spending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement in an election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is what this shows though is that something big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money you talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld so companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party\nA democratic Republican uh governor's a tax cut that basically support uh getting governors one party or the other\nOr if they're similar groups for attorney general on for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little ripped showed of a company as large companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to war\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase a backsliding that you wrote about\nOrganization that produced this report the center for political accountability has a way of looking at best that you know they're tracking these companies year after year supported and fortunately companies\nHave been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a how and where and when they spend ... and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than it used to be a fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining the U.S and the five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their uh to display their political scandal reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies\nStay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been an index longer tend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement gene ... was the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in the in the center for political accountability is eyes in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on political spending in talking to me they said their position hadn't changed they still\nDon't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like fiber one she fours twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language to Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of that say don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they tell their trade associations not to use their funds for a electorate activities\nSo that's still very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does that some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization the center for political accountability but then also uh some\nShareholder activists or shoulder advocates have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals to uh you know ... ...\nThe company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances can be either she and how those votes go overtime or just on their own initiative goaded investor and say look what a shout it'd be so you remove this project proposal and we agree with some sort of political spending a disclosure\nWays

when the ... just war Russian hackers but the first of its kind pilot program has sharply divided the tech community between supporters who say represents the future of secure elections and critics\nWho argue it does little to fix the problems inherent in online voting more from Danny Boyle and national security correspondent at the Washington Times and what's happening\nHappening in West Virginia is that you're trying to wrestle with the issue how to process ballots from there was an inch or overseas or serving in the military\nThese ballot sometimes are difficult to get in on time because it's maps of the ballot so West Virginia was taking a pretty bold step of saying actually use a smartphone applications\nBut to allow folks overseas to vote and it kind of the most experiment that exists in the country right now wow\nAll right so several presidential elections ago we would not even have considered this from a technology standpoint but these days it has to be asked what's the uh the hacking riskier\n[noise] that that's a big issue because a lot of folks\nHave said you know what what on earth is going on here you know in the last election twenty six to like you guys have talked extensively about it and wrestle with it a\nDepartment of homeland security said that there were Twenty one state states that were poor old ... by Russian hackers looking for

I just said that this block chain allows for a deeper level of verification\n... um I think what's what's interesting\nIs that Virginia is a all across the country it's a battleground state this year with senator democratic Senator Joe Manchin\nHe's up for reelection are losing a neck and neck race with other ... look up look an attorney general Patrick Morrisey so people are really watch the game and so this is a state\nWith a Republican slip it well they're going to have a pretty strong chance of maintaining a majority and accept them smoking it well it gives them a better chance to take the take the Senate back so all eyes are really watching thing that's going to be a real close race and those that were seatbelts could be extremely important\nNow and again it's not just for service members it's designed with them in mind but anybody can use this in what I Believe\nIn it yeah I Believe it and if you've got some sort of government service overseas either which somewhat narrow
