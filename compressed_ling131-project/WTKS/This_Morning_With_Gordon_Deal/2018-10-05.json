looked like a lose lose situation for Republicans abandon judge Kavanaugh and depressed the base ahead of the mid term elections or attack Dr Ford\nAnd reap the whirlwind with women come November but Jim mantle politics editor at the Washington Examiner says now it's possible the battle\nOver judge Kavanaugh could rally apathetic Republican voters especially in the red states that will decide which party controls the Senate Jim explain\nEven though Brett Kavanaugh's poll numbers nationwide or are not all that impressive and there are a lot of people who believe his is accuser over him\nIn the ... states where a lot of the Senate races are happening this year there's a little bit of a different factors are Republican voters have seen their enthusiasm for the election go up\nOr in some cases we've seen Republican Senate candidates begin to open leads races were pretty close\nAnd Cavanaugh is a factor at all of this there are a lot of conservative voters Republican voters who believe the Supreme Court nominee has been treated unfairly\nBelieve for the media has not covered him partially and they believe that the Democrats are stalling and the way and rather than try to get to the bottom of the sexual assault allegations and and to understand what really happened thirty six years ago so\nThat has for the time being a little bit of a boost to Republicans in terms of their desire to turn out to vote in November which have been in question and a lot of previous pulling the Democrats were more enthusiastic than Republicans on Republican\nAnd it's in a lot of cases seem to be skeptical that the house and Senate majorities we're really at risk\nRight so what races are being impacted here by the cabin on ...\nOr a big one is we've seen in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp of two remaining undecided Democrats who hasn't committed to which way she's going to vote on Kavanaugh a Republican challenger representative Kevin Cramer has opened up a double digit lead on her in the last two polls that have been conducted\nWho are now in the upper single digits or in terms of his lead and the average is a you know that was a race it's been closed since been considered a prime Republican pickup opportunity it now looks a little bit more solid than it has in in the last few weeks it looks like he's got a really good shot\nAt taking I kept down which you know whether that makes her more or less likely\nTo vote for Kavanaugh remains to be seen a I think we've seen also ah the school has the potential to become a real issue the Missouri Senate race where Claire McCaskill declared fairly early that she was going to vote against Kavanaugh she didn't vote for Neil Gorsuch\nHuh Josh Hawley the Republican challenger the attorney general state\nHas been really hitting her on this issue on the issue of conservative judges so he has a much narrower lead in the polls there are some polls still there was a recent CNN poll but that ... three but the point averages he's clinging to have a very narrowly it\nAnd this could be a race for influence but by the Supreme Court matter\nYou know we're speaking with Jim insult politics editor at the Washington Examiner he's written a piece titled Kavanaugh fight boosts Republicans\nIn red states this probably took a life on its own I Know there's always politics involved with Supreme Court nominees but is this sort of found material I guess for the midterms\nOh definitely I I you know it's always a very political process so it's become much more so in recent years says each party has began to escalate what kind of tactics that they're willing to employ to keep the conservative liberal balance on the Supreme Court what it currently is sort of shifted\nIn their party's favor but certainly to have something happening so close to the mid term elections were Democrats are already pretty energized because they just like President Trump\nYou know like the water and that's that's this is all coming on top of

Newman Rick how do you see it\nWell I mean so let's talk about what different um uh the uh there's a slight increase in the ... percent of the a Canadian dairy market that us farmers will have access to a they're going to be some new rules on 'em\nUsing I'm a high cost labor in the production of cars if they want to pass between the three countries duty street without attached so that might protect some of the American jobs but it's also going to raise the cost of cars and the one thing where I think Trump does deserve credit for improving upon the original NAFTA is\nNow a new provisions that protect intellectual property and data and digital assets\nWhich really were not part of the original NAFTA which went into effect in Nineteen Ninety four which was before the Internet as we think of it today even existed show in the agreement has been updated just to take\nAccount of changes in technology so that's a good thing but guess what all of those changes would have been in the Trans Pacific partnership deal which also would have included Canada and Mexico which Trump pulled the United states\nYou're just a Trump hater and like the pedal fake news isn't it [laughter]\nNo it's not true ah I run something called the ... report card you're a finance or we're give ...\nOr a setting that Trump's performance on the economy on a monthly basis we're currently give him a B for handling of the economy or that's pretty good um and what it would take to get up to an essay\nOr would probably be a better wage growth and better exports which are two districts factors we look at it but we give we are saying what tropic forgot presiding over a stronger economy\nUh I I don't get into whether Trump deserves credit for that or not I usually say look the economy kind of does its own thing\nOf a truck but presidents either get credit or blame for it so\nI'm doing okay on the economy um but some of the things she hearing you have to say what is it really worth all the controversy and disturbing drawn of oh we're going to tear up the north American free trade agreement that might cause a recession apparently we're not we're just going to make some minor changes in college victory\nRe speak with Yahoo Finance columnist ... Newman his piece is called Trump's base strategy on trade rebranding how much of this still might be geared just toward China and getting them to do something different [laughter]\nWell I think what we've seen in Trump's overall trade strategy is an evolution\nOr where he began earlier this year kind of like picking fights with everybody or he picks fights with Europe or he picks fights with everybody who in court steel and aluminum and United States that includes Japan and of course she picks fights with China with China and with Canada and Mexico\nSo as we progress through the development it does seem that that Trump's strategy is getting more shrewd\nAnd he's actually listening to trade experts say look I'm we really don't have much that trade problem with Canada we really don't have a problem with Mexico either the big problem you know the real problem here is China and if you want to confront China you need to make nice with everybody else they basically ally so why are you picking fights with allies\nUm when you need their help\nTo put more pressure on China so that's actually what's happening\nAt what point or how long into the agreement you think would be fair to measure it against the old NAFTA this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement on a U.S MCA how how long is you know worth letting it go and then in analyzing it yeah\nHere's a I mean we may not really no er during Trump's first four years okay I'm In ... we first of all it has to be ratified by the legislatures of each of the three countries and that is not a given um if it turns out that Democrats take control the house and or the Senate or both chambers next year\nOr that will be very interesting dynamic because while Democrats actually support some of these protections that Trump are also a favors they may just not want to give Trump a victory on anything so it's possible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "city": "Savannah", "day": "05"}
