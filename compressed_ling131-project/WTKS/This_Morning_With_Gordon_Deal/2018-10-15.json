conservative movements legal agenda\nIn a range of areas where the Supreme Court has failed to produce ideologically consistent results just explain\nBut he is someone who is a very uh clearly you added\nA conservative about many many legal issues up and down the scale and that he would be succeeding someone who was a somewhat more idiosyncratic perhaps more libertarian and in some areas Anthony Kennedy\nReally providing a solid majority of tested proven a hardcore for the most part conservatives or something that Republican presidents have shot to impose on the court for for almost half a century without the kind of complete success that they had expected\nSo ... what could be affected by this new Supreme Court makeup just\nSo what will change will I think we will see a lot more

we'll see you know there's a you know in the in the realm of abortion regulation I think the question is not will additional state or federal restrictions on abortion and be upheld but rather will\nThe court continue to recognize abortion as a write at all so I think the the score now though the five member majority we much much more sympathetic to state laws that\nRestrict abortion or make it more difficult to get on the court will will view the state interest in protecting potential life as much more important than it had before there by justifying those kinds of laws and ultimately it may have to ask or it may consider whether a roe v Wade back in Nineteen Seventy three which\nUh did a ... a women's right to to have an abortion whether that was a an error and whether

employers in Maine have mostly falling off the radar as a guaranteed a job out of high school small economic wins in the smaller towns should make their economies more sustainable but it can be a long path\nWall Street journal reporter John camp made a couple of visits to the region John what'd you see\nIt can be hard for any town or city with a big importer shuts down but the shock waves are\nParticularly strong when you're talking about places but in some cases hooked us both of towns to serve one industry wild and the prime example is no knock at Maine which is a fairly remote town I'm up in central Maine be put in the woods and\nIt was a place that was one of those together that very strongly to a huge meal there\nFor a century\nAnd there was a time when people coming out of high school so they they pretty much had guaranteed jobs there there was a way of life and it was really the heart of town for for generations\nAnd it was also really the only game and tell her the most ... pounds taxes provided all sort of jobs and that most shut down for a decade ago and that's the town that was very badly by population shrank\nAnd still don't have to lay off a lot of employers use they under was close to bankruptcy and they're trying to pull out of that dive right now and get some other things going but that was certainly are really major shock\n... parts of who's doing what now 'cause I there was at least a one guy I think captured maybe what others are thinking that you know I'd rather have a what China employers hiring fifty people than one employer hiring five hundred\n... well that's a very common name all around me and all of these towns because like they all realize there's danger and being a one horse town but it's great when you have that one big employing hundreds or even what workers and you know pay most taxes but\nObviously it's dangerous when you have all your eggs in one basket\nThat's good to take it away so what the towns are trying to do is rebuild\nBrick by brick really trying to help small economic wins and they realize that that's a long road it's not easy to do but the hope is that you know as you get further down that road that you're going to call me that's more stable than less vulnerable to these kinds of sharks\nYeah we're speaking with John camp hall Street Journal reporter based in Boston he took a trip up the central Maine and wrote a piece titled means mill towns search for new life um\nWhat kind of companies might they be looking for state of a an no populate stores on main street or how they might maybe refurbish some of these uh empty mills\nWell that's a good question and certainly the bill sites themselves are large industrial properties so that all of the town see holding some potential to rich can really utilize those\nProperties little fairy tale town it's ... it's a quite a lot of environmental cleanup has to be a nor the males need to be able to do math or ... or so which do things like that\nUm one example bucks court that the outlets actually do it All right uh that town has kind of a geographic advantage of that it's not quite as we're about to hit it near the coast to coast near Bangor which was a\nPretty big commercial center that man a bookstore actually has a bit of activity around the seafood industry and they have a a start up that pending regulatory wants to open a land
