I'm always thinking along the lines are where the decline [noise]\nUm [noise] I I ... I'm interested in my book called the ... of Jesus yeah\nI'm from the from the turn of the last century right\nYeah yeah I think it was published and or like you know eight\nUm apparently with what they say according to the introduction of ... it was kind of transcribe a written that transcribe by Levi Dowling\nTranscribe it from the classic record\nFor no also known as God for book of remember is another way of putting it I'm fascinated with this book because it is her role in many ways the for gospel um in in describing the life of Jesus and also covers like that so called missing years of his life\nOf highly ... market in years or so [noise] um but it does talk about the different ages and that is full of full title of the book is very current gospel of Jesus calmer the price of the highest in age\nAnd somewhere and I'm a I'm not an expert on this book but I'm fascinated with the idea of the return of the Christ and I'm not in a lot of conservative Christian I'm ... I'm more in line with Quakers and I've had with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age where they've got the current age began is there disagreement about\nThat as well yeah ours is that I'm going to determine I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what a\nYeah we're in or is this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and neo Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise\nBecause we can't there's no there's no met a\nData so that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what's something that just otherwise it'd be completely ... the way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible because I looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it is sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years um because there's a lot of different books that address that and we'll do they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all those books when I'm familiar with it covered right here I'm a good wanted a wrap it up quickly a lot of could go ask you about this book I wanted to say um I I agree with that kind of what you're saying I respectfully disagree with something you said earlier with different color\nUm something about the liar along the lines of it you you appreciate their freedom we how are we we all worship something you know what the money or her materialism or whether it's got him or herself um that we really appreciate our freedom is that you do you cook a worship your way\nI I I appreciate that but I also think that there's a downside to that as a sure\nI have an edge because you know we have the freedom but we don't always use ... oh yeah\nWe have a voting rights act individually but can we collectively\nCouldn't agree more to have some kind of shared values\nThat oh yeah well I mean we don't people make a big so I hear all get minor league political here I I think what holds us together as a country\nIs a I I I don't fixate on borders I understand the importance of security I'm I'm On board with that\nBut when people talk about it the border that makes it as a country that's just not true you know it's not the border that makes me in Arizona in or write or soon to be a a a cans and it's an uh like didn't cross the border that exist on a piece of paper\nAnd I think what holds together our values and that's what I fear most that you know we could have there could be more we need to concentrate on that more and back to a previous caller who said we've got to teach more philosophy\nAnd we ought to your philosophy should be where every education starts I agree with that but it's those shared values especially the ones on which the founding fathers base the entire country I think\nThat's what we need to always focus on that's the that's the most important thing other things are also important but that is to me the most important thing gosh well I learned a lot\nAh for people who don't find it interesting pardon the bladder but gosh darn it that was great thank you so much for\nJumping in an open lines and look forward to borrow night so the most elusive

spinal for a weekend of October you probably didn't win the mega millions jak part of the Powerball but he's still wondering what if I did\nAnd there's nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves visionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what are you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way\nWell you know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch relief far so that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and when we wonder and we think if I go by that ticket but I Do that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance and a great way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however I see you next door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about getting out not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say OK why can't I have\nX Y Z and you felt that blank again why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with and so it's not about being able to put into that\nIt stretches and it is that's a tension really different\nIs there's such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know I sure\nMean if we dream did that then we don't follow it up with any yeah then I mean that creates us to go into things like anxiety or even to be depressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we self again we self doubt we self sabotage\nMm just being with Laurie Dixon visionary coach based in Dallas texas returning about how you can turn your big lotto dreams into improving your life or a somewhat of a reality I'm so explain to the visualization process what do you do say the day after you didn't win you know a billion dollars in the jackpot\nWell I talk a lot about being in the compass some and in the status quo of life\nAnd so if you didn't when you have to at least recognize where am I stuck\nWith keeping me and not comfort zone as life what can I Do differently today and take one step up\nAnd one step out to set an intention towards something new so what is that new dream or that new opportunity like or suggest\nSo it's one step at a time\nI saw a bullet point in your notes here what I thought was interesting ... uh what do you say is the fastest way to destroy your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotaged by others that self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we allow the fear and why do we do to set yeah why why how how do we stop or why do we do is both yeah\nYeah how we stop doing that start to really realize who we are and valuing those aspects that are subtle\nAnd so it's being able to be reflected a little bit which not a lot of people enjoy and it's looking and word and saying you know I Am really about that in life\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then\nThey got punched through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire there's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times though one recently the event concluded with him stripped of his boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw and simulated body fluids his first words afterward that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was at and\nYou know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this stress base here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting blood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog\nAnd this man is monster with a mask\nJust pops out of nowhere and strict rationing them around and\nRich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear and is just nearing the simulated bodily fluids schooling vomiting on their chest and yeah so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are\nBut as they make the walk back off that property and kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would do it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last them a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some ... of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys\nWere kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scar them but you know they actually got physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having\nNo touching rural and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck but they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and\nSome of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said that they kind of expect that going in and\nYou know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being tortured but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves the story forward they're all about

point one ... wants to know\nWhat is the U.S have to do to win the Ryder Cup and Europe well that's not a complicated question at all can you know one of the things I think that has to happen and I and I tried bringing this up with with Peter Kessler earlier in the program\nYou know fill bills forty seven years old tiger is forty two years old bill will be forty nine when the next Ryder Cup comes around tiger forty four\nTigers still viable still I think has seen his last Ryder Cup into do he won't play in Europe I don't think you'll be chosen next year but I think they both kind of need to step back\nAnd give the next captain who many think will be Steve stricter give the next captain the freedom to choose whomever he wants I still think it kind of hangs over like a cloud what are you going to do with Bill what are you going to do with tiger\nAnd neither of them have really ever produced in the Ryder Cup now imagine and this would have been an interesting scenario imagine if this year ... had not made Tiger Woods the captain's pick and then tiger went on to do what he did winning the tour championship and what if he hadn't played\nIn the Ryder Cup and what if they have lost what would be what would the outcry be then\nWell you know maybe about the same as it is now because he was affective Lee not there he was old for the Ryder Cup so I think and it would be really tough in tigers case 'cause I think he thinks he'd still be viable to forty four\nI think he needs to think about stepping aside and letting the captain have whatever\nWhatever captains picks are out there maybe somebody different maybe somebody more suited to the particular golf course we'll see we'll see Ken thank you thank you for asking the question I appreciate it\nThat's the show for this

wonder and we think if I go by that ticket given that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance and upgrade or way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it\nHowever\nI see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about getting out and not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say OK why can't I have\nX Y Z and you felt that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with and so it's not about being able to put into that\nIt stretches and it sets a tension really different\nIs there's such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know I\nSure I mean if we dream did that then we don't follow it up with any yeah then I mean that creates us to go into things like anxiety or even to be depressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we self again we self doubt we self sabotage\n... speaking with Laurie Dixon visionary coach based in Dallas texas returning about how you can turn your big lotto dreams into improving your life or a somewhat of a reality I'm so explain to the visualization process what do you do say the day after you didn't win you know a billion dollars in the jackpot\nWell I talk a lot about being in the comfort zone and in the status quo of life and so if you didn't know when you have to at least recognize where am I stuck\nWhat's keeping me and not comfort zone as life what can I Do differently today and take one step up and one step out\nTo set an intention towards something new so what is that new dream or that new opportunity like or suggest day so it's one step at a time\nI saw a bullet point in your notes here what I thought was interesting uh what do you say is the fastest way to destroying your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotage by others but self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we allow the fear and why do we do have a set yeah why why how how do we stop or why do we do is both yeah\nHow we stop doing it start to really realize who we are and valuing those aspects that are so\nAnd so it's being able to be reflected a little bit which not a lot of people enjoy and it's looking inward and saying you know I Am really about that in life", "year": "2018", "show_name":
