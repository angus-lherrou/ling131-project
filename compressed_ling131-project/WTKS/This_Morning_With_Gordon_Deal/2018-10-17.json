I wanted to get the brakes and say we thought this may be very recently and it might have the same kind of it that\nIt's interesting do does um [noise] I don't know these comparisons wind up being

like the I just thought I'm just wondering what does that hurt\nYou know I I don't think it helps in the long run for these candidates and somebody like um Beto O'Rourke is a really he's a really strong candidate in his own white and he's a congressman from the whole area\nHas been there for many generations he went to Columbia He was on but I'm up at the council\nA qualified very dynamic um

situation for Democrats is incredible strength with online fundraising um these national profiles tend to eat in a feedback loop but what about liberal activists around the country\nUm the profile of a war the him compared to a Kennedy he actually does look a lot like Robert Kennedy she can't help that\nUm but it makes them a little bit of a shorthand unit at you know he's good looking at ... but

are just more Republicans and Democrats there\nBy raising these enormous sums of money that really drew attention to the race from national Republicans so in a race where maybe I'm also could have come in and quietly had erase that sort of a took\nRepublican by surprise maybe they wouldn't have spent so much money money maybe they wouldn't have\nA just an old field offices into that district
