first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to tell people go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there um you're telling people justice system is

you know you're\nYou're dropping out of power or you know or you you know by the seashore and certainly a big wave comes in it's it\nIt's that kind of thing you're not meant to swim with it though is a shame technically you can um keep the phone and least standard ... you can keep the phone and fresh water for up to about two meters for a half hour or so I guess you could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones I'm more durable than they've been or is this the standard we'd be carrying around on\nIt for well we've heard it before but apple says yes indeed that um you know this is the most durable clash they've ever went on an iPhone I did not do drop trash I Know a couple of people who did and some people are reported no problems there were a couple of ... a couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims it's it's the most horrible but it doesn't necessarily mean shatter proof so you know again my advice is don't push it to the limit\nYeah when you're trying to figure out um I mean is it best to stand it up right so maybe any or sideways do that once you can leak out of whatever buttons are holes may be in it\nUm I don't know if there's a standard way to dry

are you going to do with tiger and neither of them have really ever produced in the Ryder Cup now imagine and this would have been an interesting scenario imagined it this year ... had not\nMade Tiger
