Conan record sums of money or you know maybe make in Texas that competitive and uh you know\nOne thing that Senator Cruz says not rely on in the past but that he was able to rely on and get help with\nWas the establishment kind of coming in and helping them out you know the vice president raising money\nOr the president's son campaigning for and the president offering to come down to campaign for him or so you know senator Cruz's sort of the the coach essential outsider candidate got to get some help from the Washington insiders and the Republican Party kind of stabilized the rates and make it a you know give him a shop and check the\n... and how does this play among those who supported him for being an outsider\nInteresting ... what I think the coffee from supporters his hardcore supporters as they would argue that you know through the conservatives firebrand what he always was a huge though you don't get abandoned his values one of one of the folks that I talked to from Texas comments actually\nYou know Ted Cruz a changing his values are are becoming more of a moderate your key collapsing to support a and I don't really\nHappening is that he's just rely not helping the more collaborative he's from a bomb thrower and that that you know it's benefited him and I don't think he lost supporters has\nGot it what is the or as you said the pieces campaign wobble earlier this year a ... why is that what it would have Mr O'Rourke do for his part is part of the Senate campaign\nBut I think the thing about that that orchids he taught us money and out of the ... um you know he only crazy amounts of money he was holding these rallies that you know thousands of people who were going to and and he he kind of sparked sort of a little bit of a movement um\nAnd he was on TV protector of the without sending cruise on TV and not very surprising a Democrat could be out fending an out raising at a Republican in Texas especially wanted as widely known as Ted Cruz and and so\nI just started a little bit of concern that maybe the the sort of better movement was real impact and I think his campaign and not looking from Texas kicked into high gear\nTowards the end of summer and and going into the fall kind of realized that they ate the challenge and and you know they've quit step it up and call in shows that that that great if we didn't pretty clear he's running away with it but he's got a healthy or he said lead\nAnd the race and and so you know they had to kick it and again they were ... thirty eight million dollars in a third quarter while at is just an absolute record\nFor speak with James ... Senate campaign reporter for political he's written a piece titled cruise plays the inside game to beat O'Rourke um you said that a Senator Cruz sanded down some of the sharp edges on his personality by it could give an example\nI think the clearest example of that as you look at the Affordable CARE Act the high profile Republican tide turkey on it for a pack and you remember famously Ted Cruz shut down the government over Obamacare when he first got to ... you know he was running rallies outside the capital and he was really sort of outside\nPressure force on Republicans in fact the capital to force their hand and he did successfully forced their hands to the chagrin of his colleagues and folks in the capital and to the the new time around in ...
