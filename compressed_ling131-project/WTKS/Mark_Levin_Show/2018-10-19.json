know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were done he said you know I Want to say one more thing get cut all the ladies standup\nKept the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room\nAnd it was so great that he did that and and and I loved having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth that's perpetuated\nAbout talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss big important ideas in conservative principles and values and we have this free flow of information and exchange of perspectives and they will lie to you wouldn't say it's just angry white men\nAngry white men angry white men it's always angry white man I'm not angry are you angry I mean I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry debt ... years something wrong with you but I approached this from an angry perspective I Know that you don't\nAnd and you don't care what color I Am I don't know what color you are white and always angry white men they think\nI'm In and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women boy I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now at the didn't big markets and across the country and when you say women I like to hear from you boom those phone lines just explode\nBecause let me tell you something there's no way you can grow and expand\nThe kind of of communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being a just targeting angry white men it's a myth it's a lie\nThat they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want\nIs for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and uh blow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to you know get real jobs and have to wear long pants\nAnd have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nAnd it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way\nAnd it terrifies but the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers\nIn the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television\nNewspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this is hate radio that it's nothing but a bunch of angry old white men shouting hand so when we have the opportunity to say hey ladies love to hear from you [noise]\nExplodes or the the
