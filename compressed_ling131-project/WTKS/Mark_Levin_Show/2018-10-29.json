resolution at the United nations\nThe American media in this country I said back in may had blood on its hands what Hamas backed by the Muslim Brotherhood backed by Iran backed by Hezbollah\nWas riding on the Gaza Strip shooting missiles into Israel Israel definitive so they immediately attacked Israel they immediately attacked the Jewish state\n\nVirtually all of them I spoke about that on line\nOne Brock Obama pushed through this Iran deal violated our constitution pushed through the Iran deal gave them a hug and gave them one point five billion dollars in ransom\nFollowed by facilitating another hundred and fifty billion dollars to that regime which is a terrorist regime which has its own people and its own journalists by the way media\nWhich is set it intends to destroy all the Jews in Israel and by the way intends to destroy the United states Obama was set up right\nHe was celebrated\nObama literally armed with billions and billions of dollars a grave enemy of ours

Jewish children and grandchildren\n\nAnd despite every presidential election\nPandering\nAbout recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel pandering about moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem is president you're opposed to the un opposed him even some Jews in our own country opposed to like J Street\nHe's appointed\nA great patriot and the most pro Israel American as a

crimes in this country aren't against Muslims are against Jews\nWell why don't they do stories on this\nAnd who is attacking the Jews why don't they just stories on this why don't they do stories long stories repetitive stories rather than on porn stars in their lawyers and all the rest of it why don't they go to the college campuses and see what happens to the Jews on our college campuses why don't they see what happens\nWith the Palestinian organizations you really want to get to the bottom of it they don't want to get to the bottom of it\n\nOf course they don't want to get to the bottom

the Israel hating policies of the prior president\nHe never ever that friend it a man like professor lady and his wife what their ties to Hamas like Obama did he ever sat in up to somebody Jeremiah

Trump the result Jews in Israel have to defend themselves\nAs President Trump the reason the leader the British Labour Party is an anti Semite if President Trump the reason Louis Farrakhan called

[noise]\n\nBars love America as passionately so we've real voice talk with that voice now eight seven seven three one two three eight one one what's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there are certain [noise]\nWell it's you know a horrific act towards that but it's a medic attack in us history they climbed eleven lives I I was Pittsburgh yesterday\nThat to meet with a member of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there a congressman Republican and Democrats and talk to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just by did among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here and\nI think they were just shocked and start a and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone and in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday 'cause some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week and the government\nIt's every Sunday and there was this a moment of silence where the entire government\nOf Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel or a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why I was important for me to be in Pittsburgh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach stickler is about that yeah we're the ones with a nice beach that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see grooming anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we kind of it is as you say a growing problem\nOr many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nAh in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half\nAnd by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh uh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen\nI really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack twos and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six of the G federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City with I think claim three lives\nAnd this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media because you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you could have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's extreme is can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white\nNationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media\nAs you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given them a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here and I know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of\nThis kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I\n... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own said whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever cops well it's not a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and the same and demonize Israel and make all these wild charges that Israel's apartheid state of racist state a perpetrator of tennis star\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people put a level of hatred towards Israel but you don't see of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the cruise I think they're going to be protecting everybody\nAll right and bass in Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless them thank you sir thank you

a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look with Trump half the time and I love post cabin up because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and uh as she should be because listen I mean she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nSenator McCaskill turns around to vote no on Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could\nNot be we're out of step what does she running in New York and Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator from one of those places but for this state hardly and that is ... that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the polls or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you or votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or a Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her of of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures\nAre from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up a Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and to have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in one of your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and\nThat is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody's going to be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\nBut you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's pre existing conditions on the health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose us a methods of protecting people with pre existing
