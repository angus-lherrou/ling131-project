there's been a break in the case or real break in the case over the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case up in a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice in at the upper level management the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you been gone [laughter]\nThe Donald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by by use liberal footnotes that way to liberals camera phew what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence a opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case the FBI the upper levels and their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now\nWhy am I bring that up now not to give you like oh what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so that break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe unleashed they just the port of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going not remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate\nThe explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank\nThat's in my book and lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reasons the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank oh that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there\nNo shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here is a problem there having the last story they settled on\nThat was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris this to\nYou know George Papadopoulos did it George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed\nOn the information that there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight that court there's a verification process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information chew at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this big sometimes a little complicated may have been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting an house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nOr significant it's becoming clear as day now\nThat the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of is that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale was made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court was not\nThat folks was not that\nIt was only the stop alleged basically in the ... and here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence [noise] support and folks because of this whole\nEntire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have if the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information the guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole thing that's why this is so

bustamante for report now posted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report\nOh this is just kind of a minor detail here the majority horns identifiable ancestry is European\n... however the report it however the analysis also identified five genetics segments as Native American in origin at high confidence bustamante is analysis places wards Native American ancestry between six and ten generations ago with a report estimating eight generations\nUh okay so let's say going to get something here\nIs where the Boston Globe and they're they're mad\nReally got off track by the way really got off track trying to figure out a the the sex to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say a generations ago what would that equal here and the answer\nElizabeth Warren as it turns out is more lily white men and Whitey white folk like perhaps you and me that is what the experts have\nSo you been able to find after they dug into the report on her website ... now all throughout the course of the day I have heard from my\nMy friends still lives here in in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the dearth of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average left just want to be socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren commonly received the question will why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be she just didn't want to get into it and she I mean this was her Neal nobody told her to go out there and get all actually President Trump did\nPresident Trump did in fact ah do you have cut three ready\nThey're going to Republicans [noise] think of it [noise] think\nThe of the great [noise] tribal\nIs it a let me think about that\n[noise] they've done to your face or life\nOn being a minority

problems you know that name because now even the liberal or say\nThere you go she took the test they always entertaining and fresh and Donald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she taught test so she's the one who put it back out there and you you have to wonder\nYou have to think that the president prompting her like that you think she was like I'd rather take the test\nAnd then he or she supposed to be Ivy League educated right when you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there is I yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then they experts go oh\nActually no you are whiter than the average white folk here in the United states\nJust saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down the ball now in the end the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kind of smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck asking junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nWho coined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage\nAs fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliations oh by the way he was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nAnd makes a mockery out of DNA testing and it's a legitimate use as well also does honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes the dynamite and he questions\nYeah you can have the the president the United states report to Elizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud but really only have to do\nIs listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation that she claims to be about up\nGoogle or a broad\nOld by the way I mean details you know these little things so part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of and throughout the day is well I mean what difference does it make any way in Trump's tax returns okay let's talk about the the tax return thing real quick\nYou know not to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight from the tribe that she claims to be part of\nA kind of tough tough for her to rally back from that one way the the president in terms of choice holy cow you had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels\nNow to be ready for it to us I guess horse face\nThat uh that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabian situation will be discussing that a little bit of a leader in the show we have the oh by the white Honduran caravan part whatever this is three point O.\nBetty is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president twenty now\nThe United states has strongly and formed a president upon doors that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.

it that we give foreign aid to countries this girl is over and over and over and the case ... we give them a billion and a half bucks per year\nA half books out the door and government for so they take it and then\nSend their people out to try to crush their borders unreal [noise] but anyway president paying attention and if he does stuff the eighth step one to recovering when you're being

disaster for our country it'll turn our country indoor Venezuela but that one actually happened because I Will never let it happen\nThat's something else it's just kind of great about Donald Trump the president of the United states [noise] you never got stuff like that from Bush\nHe didn't want to get that from anybody else just says train travel is right there and boom that was President Trump putting out a video about the fraud that is Medicare for all in fact when I was last with you friday night we were talking about but for all that is Medicare for all\nIt's not just Pocahontas that's fraud Medicare for all which is also pushing for is the fraud\nBernie it's upon Andrew Gillum running for governor in Florida on a platform of attempting to impeach the president and Medicare for all it's a fraud\nAnd if you happen to mess and that conversation brought a here's the Reader's Digest version right now you got Fifteen Percent of the U.S population on Medicare Fifteen Percent All right you think about how many people pay enjoy your organ okay you're paying into it\nNow Fifteen Percent or ... on it everybody working paying into it and we are set for insolvency in eight years eight years twenty twenty six\nAnd by the way it does that mean talking to some kinda kooky right we map from from stuff that comes from the trustee the trustee Medicare dizzy after the uh not so Affordable Care act was passed\nAnd you have the Democrats that diverted Medicare money we went from seeing a Medicare begin insolvency in the twenties thirties to well twenty twenty six\nSo we're just eight years away from Medicare saying uh yeah you know one nine percent of the benefits year one are going to go away and it gets worse from there now you have the president United States has not ... afraid to say it's a fraud\nSo for all the people that go yeah you know I was just over there smoking some doping Elizabeth Warren is making a lot of sense right now for that person hey\nMake sure they don't vote if you can help it because we should not have a yeah everybody else I I may get often intangible questions I I went there you've got all the PSA this time of year in and these cycles always drive me crazy you you have the the vote or die type of ... are out there everybody should vote I vote you vote we vote\nBull crap every election has consequences from local elections especially local

funny thing about how ignorant Taylor Swift actually has about Tennessee politics and health fake her tendency values are in fact you might say that there were Swiss tendency values are about as fake

Trish Reagan just a little while ago a Fox Business I think that would all kinds of territory end up having a couple of close the main news than the least of which was about the fed saying that\nThere is nothing as threats to the economy [laughter]\nUh so if you've seen people get hysterical about bad die it happened during that particular interview but\nSomething has happened over the last several days that led me to go ahead and do something a little bit early I wouldn't usually do this until after the general election one because it's kind of annoying to me it's like\n... the point of which were not even into September and you're going to the store and the Halloween stuff is all rubbing up against the Christmas like seriously at all now little space oh distance it's not necessary not yet right\nCan we not get through the mid term election before it's about twenty twenty I mean is there are so dumb because you have really did twenty twenty election that started during the Kavanaugh hearings because\nRemember the only reason we have Spartacus was because of twenty twenty I Am about putting gas and all that was his moment\nTo Iowa was born in his mom and write\nIt his ah his Fifteen minutes of ... and the lecturing and then you have a ... Cory Booker Spartacus who who went to Iowa imagine what that's like by the way\nYou imagine if someone like Cory Booker marching into Iowa\nI mean ... the first thing is just think about how much your elitists leftist load since the the Centre part of the kind of fly every country in Ninety six percent of the land mass of the United states of America is red\nStart taking a look at where the majority that is so you here you have Spartacus marching into I Want to test the waters over the weekend I mean seriously yeah Kamala Harris holding her nose in reading California to go to the south she went to South Carolina\nI imagine how painful that is for her and of course\nWhy do we have the test the Native American ancestry test by one\nRefer to occasionally as Elizabeth Warren really bad Pocahontas or it's ultimately because she's also running now for twenty twenty she might have just taken herself out of it we we shall see although who knows and democratic ranks just might be a rally ankle\nBut because all of this is going on and you even have the president of the United states being asked about twenty twenty on a near daily basis I feel the need to tell you this president Donald Trump will likely be reelected\nOr go up to you from ... he's reelected now\nBefore you just said they're going after it was pretty baseless no it's not even anything to do with the economy is not anything to do with\nAll the record improvements that we've been thing here is the first reason why the odds are in his favor he's an incumbent president running for reelection so let's start their sixty five percent of presidents who run for reelection when\nAnd in order not to when you have to be as lame is kept in the night before mentioned Jimmy Carter or you have to do something like read my lips no new taxes and then raise taxes make it yourself Ross Perot\nAnd it splits about coming up\nI Will give you a little bit of the background about that sixty five percent and we'll get into someone's going to Saudi Arabia as well it is a it's festive we we have a lot to talk about we're just getting warmed up I Am by mud in for the great one more glove it\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves I Can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be a reelected I mean people already seen the mistake that to me\nLike you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting down in contacts you have to take a look at\nWhat it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working out for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah it was a Ford did break for\nDonald Trump beyond that\nAt since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote oh by the way probably\nNot going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote to like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people going out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you take a look at the economy\nWe have the best economy and the generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school you're in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I\nGuess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you got some lines that are up and that's the God of me in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years and by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember our do about the white men white men\nAnd Asian man the only ... only demos out there that are not\nA record low unemployment right out oh by the way\nBut you also have the biggest increase in their take home pay in thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I see a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the way personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government in interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided to ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against\nSo that in two years fans are is if anything he probably is attracted more boats ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next book and this is the under state it going\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often or are we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem you take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people specifically oh\nThese are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we beliefs cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as he's fully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this bar to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some uh folks from uh the the Saudi regime that dinner\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bought bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring it back him up you're on the other side I Am by mud and for the great one month\nHim Mm\nAsk

of ah not Benjamin Button but the ... who has gone missing two weeks ago today and at this point\nIt's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out of Saudi Arabia or the other day I mean like we as a crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and yeah you know I I mean that they would just I\nJust really hated when when we accidentally kill I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really and\nThat apparently is what we're eventually gonna get or at least that's the rumor of what we are going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that to have the king this young and and hip king who say women could draw right now I mean come on I mean is that he liked yeah when they get dry\nSo he's so did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything\nSo that's where we we are in this process but the the way the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything denies that eyes everything so\nThis is difficult it's difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact quote was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks who say yeah you know like shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever it was Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we're very close very close to energy independence of this country by the way did he know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil and not Saudi Arabia\nRussia us us\nLike right we're actually facing the get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because if Saudi Arabia and the influence they had 'em into pack a day decided hey you know we don't like you putting pressure on us and they go ahead and dramatically reduce production you could see spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy ... you know what happens there\nSo that's one thing we got to consider in this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive I Am and and equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel where he can get that in the middle east you take it for sure that is what complicates this deal but the problem is still is mentioned three law it's evil wherever it's it's about there's nothing good about it\nWe have had\nOne thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year\nWe've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured\nOh by the way so Islamic terror still alive and well ... and the folks that govern underage still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about three law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them that carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now we haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of the government the bigger problem is if you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and\nIf you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people at will because I don't know there are a woman they were raped or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like just journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback this thing it's much different to to be pragmatic with everything that's on the line we're up to see where this all goes let's go to Isaac in Washington Isaac go\nHey Brian how are you all day today I'll go they are I was talking to your call screener are about ...
