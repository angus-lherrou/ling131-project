basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agreed to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want to ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lax enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seemed to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant\nAnd nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right um even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one came all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument\nThat the one who was in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue and and this is really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that\nThe declaration of independence would actually the vision would actually be actual allied and then the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that shouldn't citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being bastard die to subvert the actual meaning and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a rep\nLimit let me just say that that I have to go some Len let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans that amendment that amendment\nWas for former slaves that's\nIt done\nAnd it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of their nothing whatsoever so the left pores that agenda end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Harlow let's keep up the good work we much appreciate and my friend thanks about God Bless\nAnd God Bless you to listen to this the IRS hired a small army of private collectors of your heart just skipped the beat changes are you oh the IRS because hearing the most powerful collection and she just got more powerful is pretty scary\nYo the Irish do what listeners penny and Ken is dead and co opt them a tax relief they own a lot of money and they were living in fear of losing their savings to retirement their business everything\nOptimist stop the aggressive collection actions and stop the small army attacks collectors from targeting them\nOptimum knows that behind every tax problem are honest hardworking Americans with families homes savings and paychecks that need protection they're experts in their fresh start initiative a special iris program that could save you a thousands even tens of thousands of qualified\nNow that's just one of many ways optimum has resolved over half a billion and tax that for clients half a billion car\nOptimal tax relief at eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred that's eight hundred for nine sixty three hundred we'll be right back [noise] month\nMay ...\nVon ... federal officials say they're melting the death of fame Boston mobster James Whitey Bolger as a homicide he was found on the response of this morning into West Virginia in federal prison Fox's girl Scott\nBolger was convicted in Massachusetts and twenty Thirteen after being on the run for sixteen years and sentenced to life for racketeering mommy laundering and gun possession among other charges the eighty nine\nYear old had just been moved to the west Virginia facility in the past day with the midterm elections just a week or way President Trump creating controversy over his announcement he could issue the executive order ending citizenship for immigrant children born in the country which is a ride on the fourteenth amendment\nSuch an executive order would almost certainly be challenged in the federal courts which would then decide whether the fourteenth amendment applies to undocumented immigrants boxes drawn Becker at the White House\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nSt Louis radio nine seven point seven and twelve Ninety am double duty chaos and home two AM so bad with Bill in law to ban is only live and blue morning show [noise]\nGonna hears various arguments that people want to repeal the fourteenth amendment has nothing to do with repealing the fourteenth amendment you're near spurious arguments that this has been the way it has been for a hundred and fifty years\nThat's nonsense this started in the Nineteen sixties\nIt started in the Nineteen sixties when immigration what the hell\nThe whole rule of law changed\nInterpretation of the Constitution's fourteenth amendment\nTo apply to the children of illegal aliens didn't take place until over a hundred years later\nTill over a hundred years later Congress didn't do it\nThere was no executive order there was no court decision the bureaucracy just started doing it nobody knows exactly who did it they just started doing it\nThat is what progressive stew and now the hear Republicans say so called conservative Republicans say look you can't change the constitution with an executive\nOrder or we don't do what Obama left us using an executive order and law of us that you\nKnow I don't doubt that activist judges and courts will make that argument but for Republicans and conservatives to completely reject the constitution to completely reject history and they claim\nThat the bureaucracy can reinterpret the fourteenth amendment that President who's in charge of the bureaucracy can't put\nWith an executive order is ridiculous again the courts are out of control\nThe president has the right state of mind you know Mr producer was such a fan of my next year we finally decided it was time to get them his own he's got his own extra now and he loves it Mr producer and I are different heights different sizes and how they actually chair conforms to each of us to provide the same unbelievable level of support in comfort is really extraordinary\nAnd he's feeling the difference physically less pain more energy better focus more productivity you need to feel the extra difference for yourself\nAnd if you want to see how beautiful this amazing cherish just go to ... chair Levin dot com ... dot com and you'll see the different models and there are numerous models\nYou own a small business or any business take my advice if you want a happier more productive employees then considered getting X. chairs for your entire staff\nIt's very reasonable investment that will pay huge dividends extras on show right now for a hundred dollars offer all of them you go to ... dot com that's ... chair L. E. V. I. N. dot com or call one eight for for for next year one aid for for for\nI've written about it\nHad nothing to do with this subject as a matter of fact the author of the amendment that man who drafted it\n\nAnd the supporters of the civil rights act that the time made it clear that didn't exempted foreigners and aliens and so forth which is rational so when you're putting the constitution people say rocket attacks look what it says you look at the text in that context of what the people who wrote it meant that's an originalist\nNow for the left they could care less they pour everything they wanted the fourteenth amendment so they don't matter but the media which of course is on the left but it's not supposed to be\nTo be so ignorant Jim Acosta and again to start trashing the president of United States who didn't even bring it up and he was surprised they came up and he was on as soon as responds yes we're looking at a potential executive order\nTo attack\nHim and say here he is Mr race made her again is it is beyond belief that the media conduct themselves this way I'll give you another example the Anti Defamation league which is now headed by a former special assistant debris Iraq Obama\nThe which one what\nYou've been hearing day in and day out now since the slaughter in Pittsburgh\nAnd you've heard it from the media that there's been an increase in hate crimes against Jews anti Semitism in the United states since Trump was elected\n\nAnd what did they do\nThey looked at twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen and then twenty sixteen\nAnd increase six hundred and eighty four\nCases well why did they start\nIn twenty Thirteen how about your starting twenty twelve one block Obama was president eight hundred and sixty eight cases or how 'bout twenty eleven seven hundred and Seventy one cases are about twenty ten\nEight hundred and eighty seven cases how about two thousand nine nine hundred and thirty one case is or how about two thousand eight when Obama was elected one thousand and Thirteen cases\nThe highest number since two thousand two\n\nAs a matter of fact in almost every year the Obama presidency hate crimes against Jews was higher\nThan in twenty sixty\nNot in every year but almost every year hate crimes against Jews did CNN or MSNBC point that out did they say that the language that Obama uses one trashing the prime minister of Israel what trashing the state of Israel\n\nA language that Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry use resulted in the rise of anti Semitism intimate course not well why not\n\nAnd for CNN and MSNBC keep talking about the tone out there that may have led to this this Jew hater Trump painter who's Florida those eleven Jews how do we know you didn't cause it\nHow do we know it wasn't Jake Tapper report that Jake Tapper did that push this guy over the edge or ... or ...\nOr ...\nHow do we know how do we know it wasn't any of the hosts on MSNBC\n\nHow do we know it wasn't the New York times or the Washington Post how do we know it wasn't Chuck Schumer and Pelosi or Maxine Waters how do we know they didn't push this guy over the edge we know that he didn't like Trump\n\nWow how do we know that it wasn't that tone\n\nThe ladies and gentleman to the consternation of some but not you my loyal audience\nYou know I'm a fierce defender of this country I'm if there's the center of our principles are constitutional declaration individual liberty I'm a fierce defender of this nation because we are a virtuous people a virtuous country\nNo country is perfect\nBut you don't see Americans pouring into central and South America to escape America you see people in central South America pouring into the United states to escape their country's in their cultures\n\nAll over the world you see the same thing people in Southeast Asia the middle East Africa pouring into the United states not Americans pouring into those places we're supposed to pretend that culturally and every other way we're on an equal ground with them while we're not\n\nThis is the shining city on a hill is Reagan put it and we all know\n\nThat there is a Little America if you will in many respects Israel which reflects the values of the United states the principles of the United states\nThat belief in individual humanity and liberty and a democratic system in a rule of law\n\nAnd I've been a fresh defender\nOf the state of Israel and the people of Israel\nEven when the media CNN and MSNBC and all over the the media\n\nAttack this tiny little country every time this tiny little countries that tact by terrorists back in may\nBack in may\nWhen Israel was subjected to a terrorist attacks from Hamas pushed by Iran and Hezbollah\n\nThe media reporting was shameful and shameless\nThere are

that I contend is utterly and completely bogus on its face\nSo I'd be in it would be it would be a nice debate and I used to be a civil debate\nBut his officers listening he may be listening I Want to invite him on the program we can debate birthright citizenship not the politics of it the constitution the fourteenth\nAmendment but the draft or the fourteenth amendment said what the\nTreatment of
