Santa's for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nThe lights are from the story a major union for police officers the Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron does Santa's for governor four years ago the Florida PBA indoors the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently is a Democrat that is a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually it was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran does that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boils boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this\nHose or that pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sudden kennel he ended the article what this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother said their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I notice what was going on\nNot long after the whole cap or next thing broke was taking a look and and I was\nTracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole cap or next thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops who were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative the advance\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics visit they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three since they last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed\nThree forty killed and until this week\nWe had and and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and for about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line duty afforded than any other state in the country but this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nWhen he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media\nBy politicians and it's exactly why I started this theory that I did a couple of years ago and in the grand scheme\nChoosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop get ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and\nTell me you're not going to find a bad apple but almost every one of all good people

kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't have good folks don't want to be police officers that put on the badge to leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy way those Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nIs all
