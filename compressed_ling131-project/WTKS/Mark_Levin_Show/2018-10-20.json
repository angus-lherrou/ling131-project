name one thing the Trump stood for it was enforcing our borders and building a wall to protect our southern border there's no two ways about this is I Know that there was a lot else going on in this election\nOr the the uh antipathy for Hillary Clinton or the you know decades of of her\nInvading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike away or the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton or the promise tax cut the the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside for a minute if you ask the men on the street name me one issue Trump ran on the\nVast majority would be building that well and protecting our border and Republicans I understand why in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you it's because the Democrats do it in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really wanted to they could have\nPushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written\nWar it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody who votes\nThinking yeah I'm going to put

keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step I'm Larry O'Connor in for Merkel event hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys though I've watched I've watched the border over the years grew up in Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a here they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and then you have people standing in line trying to do with the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know sterile it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song and they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him\nRight if oh\nIf only that really were the case in fact what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean there have been there forever I mean obviously is not no longer with us but uh\nIt just they slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences you know of of when you get here and then now they're actually given the benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five kids go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA uh people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever they want says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I get a hold\nOn I'm sure there's a lot there here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding and they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they've got a job that means they buy their lied\nAbout their documentation or they were using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument is that complete and total nonsense [noise] if someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThey are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had bit surely and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Kent in Los Angeles wet my my adopted my my first adopted home now Washington this is my second adopted him you're listening on the great age seven to the answer care LA or I Can't what do you make of this\nAll right um [noise] well I wanted to ... talk to people about getting out and vote and I think that false pole and ah [noise] are\nConvinced chauffeur showing and slander also discourage
