V. chip off on I heart radio\nBy his nominee President Trump at a rally in Tennessee continue to provide support for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh Fox is the rabbit board has more line\nI was watching mostly HGTV to be honest with you I guess I'm the only one and you'll get more but tonight and tomorrow and tomorrow night before there's any actual news but\nIsn't it amazing that was the lawyers involved there's not a single accuser whose filed a criminal complaint not want\n'cause if you file false criminal complaint you can be charged with a felony\n\nOr maybe they're afraid at a case will be taken to go to court and the lows\n\nWhy haven't they filed a criminal complaint and then they talk about we want an FBI investigation you know why they do that to you so you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that those\nAre real live criminal investigation now there's not\nThis has nothing to do with a criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested the two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that ask\nDr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWhat if she does not what it is Ramirez does instead we get reporters we get get people giving their opinions we get this I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators laying out a huge list of in discrepancies a memory lapses of contradictions respecting\nDr Ford crickets nobody gives a damn\nBefore that she would track Mahler ... she's an incompetent incompetent my but she was great\nThese are facts\nSo why\nWhy didn't miss Ford's Dianne Feinstein hand picked lawyer\nDebbie Katz\nTake her clients hand and walk into the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\nThey dare not do it they dare not do it\nOr ms ... lawyer they dare not do it\nOr the rat\nThey dare not do it instead just keep them we need an FBI investigation isn't it interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flight not one of them said you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\n'cause that that's why\nNow you'll hear this now on Fox I'm short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK\nI'm used to this\nBut it's an important point\nHe said because in a court of law there's the cabinet does have the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law if it's a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable\nDoubt but as a prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her paper there's not even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum\nAnd everybody's gathered 'cause now the lines are going to kill the Christian just throw Kavanaugh in there from in their everybody's excited everybody cheering what do you mean due process due process she's up against the law and what the hell do we care\nWhat do we care\nThese phrases innocent until proven guilty apparently they only apply to a al ... terrorists and mass murders\nNot the federal judge not\nThe federal judge you got Frank Rich that part's tweeted\nKevin O's bragging about coaching girls' basketball as troubling in retrospect and why is that Frankie\nWhy is that you use nibbling moron\nOr judge lego whoever the hell that in retrospect Kavanaugh using a girls' basketball team as a prop during his confirmation hearing doesn't seem like a coincidence really jot\nNow they're sick go\n\nAnother sick I and go down the list are so called free media\nNot a free media turn on free media\nThe way they cherry pick their stories they're partisanship it's obvious to everybody even the people who watch these these carbon footprint\nSays CNN and MSNBC they know they're part is and that's why they watch 'em all twelve people\n\nBut I go back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations would not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland\nNot one and I'll tell you something else\n[noise] one of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about Kavanaugh is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation she would lose\nEven on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence\nIf he sued Mrs Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and his crime they would lose you can accuse people of the most vital things with\nNo evidence with no witnesses it no corroborate ...\nIt's a slam dunk now might take a few years but\nThey know he won't they know he can't given his interest in still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit these accusers\nAnd their lawyers and the Democrats in Congress fear the legal system the legal system in this case\nAnd they should all be right back [noise] [noise]\nHim make\nThe right fit with him

News Democrats and Republicans continue to argue over the confirmation vote for judge Brett Kavanaugh boxes you aren't helping live on Capitol Hill\nThen there's a lot at stake is it there when the federal government's making decisions the fifty states the territories are much less important must less influential\nAs the central government gets stronger and stronger and more and more ubiquitous you can't escape it\nWhen the federal government makes a decision it doesn't matter what state you moved to\nYou can't escape and it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare\nWhatever the issue is it's a winner take all that's not at all what the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about in Atlanta\n\nWhat you're watching now is the breakdown of the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution\nUnited States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong the earliest period the turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds as it was building in the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no there are six year terms of course\nBut their elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational purpose\nIt's been bastard that\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively in the federal Congress\nTo members from each state states would determine how they're chosen they can be elected by the people although very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\nBut this so called populism movement\nAnd the progressive movement eliminated that and so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism when it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that you\nAlso see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional listen conservative friends seated Lee disagree with me I've written about this and the Marlboro versus Madison decision the Supreme Court seized power\nSeized\nPower from the other federal branches\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus Marbury and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a ... not only the constitution but the parties involved\nThere is no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should've been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down that road right now I'm just I'm just explaining that the Supreme Court power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states\nThe states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not ratified in Massachusetts\nIn New York and in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates for\n\nTwo of them from New York one of them from Virginia John J. Hamilton and Madison they honestly believe that they had created a governing system that would protect the American people not just from monarchy\nBut for mob rule and more and more we're both\nWith the permanent government in Washington DC and the lifetime appointees when the Supreme Court\nAnd mob rule\nBecause of the\nThe unraveling of our Republican little are Republican system\nSo you see the development of these factions and the facts on on the left has become extremely violent extremely aggressive\nWith its restaurants are airports whether it's hands teeth are black lives matter before that other movements in the Nineteen sixties\nThe weather underground and the association between these radical elements and members elected members but the Democrat Party is really quite shocking\nAbsolutely shocking and the association between them and most of our media is unconscionable\nAbsolutely unconscionable this is why the constitution is so important and this is why Republicanism is so important\n\nAnd the left keeps trying to destroy them one of the reasons if not the main reason that you see the the obliteration\nOf the confirmation process when it comes to the Supreme Court one of the reasons you see it is because Kavanaugh has pro fast he has declared that he's a constitutional is\n\nThe enemy of the progressive state is the enemy of the Democrat leadership in Washington the enemy of the Democrats' Senate members on the Judiciary Committee is the constitution truth be told try they always talk about precedent\nNot the text of the constitution not being original meaning of the constitution that's why they always\nDeclare that our original documents our founding document and our governing document\nAre really no legitimate in many ways you say because too many that people who are involved in the process were slave holders\nTherefore they are to be dismissed or used in order to advance\nTheir destruction in the cause of progressive as again you're seeing this play out in the United States Senate not to the extent we're discussing it here intellectually but this is the consequence\nFactions\nA defamation violence or we're going to take a look\nAt exactly what I'm Talking about when we return I'll be right back\nHim mom\nYou know it's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Levin L.
