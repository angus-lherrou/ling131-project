you look over your shoulder from time to time it's not 'cause you're paranoid just you had to be a little bit more careful\n\nBut wanting teeth all is out there in ... is filled with violence it's the most violent organization I'm aware of in politics today it was downplayed by most of the media downplayed same of black lives matter downplayed and I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded so they have these uh these packages and these devices are in their uh original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys or gals\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience of the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\n\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they they're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people\nBecause they may do it again they may do more of it\nThat's all we know we don't know their motives\nWe don't know their motives well we know the motive uh obviously it's a threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why\nCan't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see the crescendo building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question facing death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or a scapegoat bears says about him\n\nThe other day the president said her rallies in a rally I think it was used in a says he's a nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try and tie it to Nazi isn't or the ... or ... style these this is in the media\n\nNational socialist party noticed when people proclaimed that their socialist they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right they didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using style on his language no of course not\n\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves so for them now the sit back\nFor the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC and CNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America\n\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump would absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\nThe person or people\nA responsible for this are responsible for this\n\nAre responsible for this\n\nDo you think the media in this country over the last two years have been responsible do you think the meeting this country over the last two years have been measured\nYou'd think the media in this country many in the media in this country cross the line with their references to Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\nYou think Joe Scarborough was cross the line or make a ... or Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on you think they cross the line with their heated rhetoric what their point something language\nAnd now\nYou're going to tell you [noise] calmed down stop the rhetoric\nThe heated attacks we must bring it down it's too much having ... the flames now they're the firefighters\nAnd same with ... the things that she is said and same was shooting the things that he has said and the things that they did to a guy like Kavanaugh to a guy like Kavanaugh to correct the tensions in this society and the anger in this society do they have any responsibility for it\nA a a guilty of trees and we've had we've had so called airports you're respected commentators accuse the man of treason accusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces mark\nOne of the things you Sean and the people in the industry of always been clear on on the conservative side people are responsible for their own actions that maniac who shot up these college and the baseball field that guy's responsible for his own action\nBut having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation of public have to be more responsible but that's not conservative and the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make it some kind of a political issue without having any more than the fact that Scott ...\nOne of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during the campaign some ... whatever his name as\nThis guy yesterday on TV I think it was on TALK show refuse to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and

Doberman\nSo CNN brings on Gregory makes\nIt was an attack or a Democrat from New York with Wolf Blitzer listen to this cut Seventeen go\nMy first reaction to that is a natural rush is with us\nAnd thought that apparently is what this president is a and to say that we are as fat or a bad or you know it reminds me of the kinds of words or that came from people like\nA Hitler who thought that in Germany he wasn't nationalist and the kinds of people that this president\nSeems to a life in vale does who repressive dictators are those are the individuals that generally use that kind of afraid and does this\nThis is just so over the top and CNN gives them voice reminds this guy of Hitler and this president it seems to like\nDictator why he didn't open an embassy in Cuba that was the prior president he stood up to ... and he stood up the Chinese stood up through Iran he stood\nNorth Korea these are all things that Obama wouldn't do where's the evidence that he likes dictators where's the evidence that he's anything like Hitler do people know what Adolf Hitler did\nNow this was on CNN what Blitzer sits there like a pop on a lot doesn't cut off the congressman that Congress men is invited because he's a hater because you see we want to lower the temperature out there ladies and gentlemen we're being told by the media today\nThat same me that promotes this go ahead\nWhat are you

their societies is not working with others outside of society and some press individuals' when it went into society has to do when the goals of what they're looking for [laughter] so that was a very dangerous words but I think it's a very very\nDangerous word nationalist so very very dangerous or you got to listen to me throughout the program I'm going to hit this very very importantly in the next few minutes go ahead\nWe know this president is\nWell I just want to be precise a congressman your bigger Paris and between the primary in the United states and Hitler and I want you to explain exactly what you mean 'cause obviously this is a this is controversial well what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and the NASA was\nIn life that set an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt\nThe progressive\nMovement was really borne out of the Republican Party early on\nAnd it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd then there's new nationalism speech I said he

powers that can finds\nThe ability the federal government to help people\n\nAnd it was on the left on the progress of like the new nationalism\n\nSo why do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler why do they call him a racist when he uses the word nationalist\nThe criticism should be that's a progressive term that progressive to own that\nIn the twentieth century\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory makes is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\n\nThis is a phrase a word\n\nThat is central to understanding progressive as ... and the central is Asia and the American government they're intellectuals wrote about it all the time\n\nExcept the president's to be criticized softly it should be using a word I
