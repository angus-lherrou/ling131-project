Fox News that's the warning from Florida governor Rick Scott hurricane Michael now a category ... storm with top sustained winds of one hundred twenty miles per hour because\nWith a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winter I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some sort of substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not seeing one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office that Trump's scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the God of the seasons in Beijing and communist red China that takes about\nFive hundred billion dollars a year so in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according Erasmus and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit its back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh your an innocent man and he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful\nThis guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and laws go spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my model\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined that they will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHad in him to fight back and no holds barred straight parole or fashion because But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his uh all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a try\nAttorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine four testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine Ford was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one of her witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical of this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her\nWhen she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said at the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the mid Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and the direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit\nBut because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nBut what's happening in San Francisco and other cities but now the protesters in Portland are back on the streets blocking traffic have you seen the videos several dozen\nOr in a particularly disturbing video protesters takeover intersections stopped traffic parading harass older white men in cars who refused to obey their traffic directions Portland police under the idiotic leadership of mayor Ted Wheeler do nothing\nThey yell at these older white men you're a little white supremacist go back to the south know KKK here et cetera\nIn one video protesters smashed an older white man sedan with baseball bats after he makes a turn against their wishes they've taken over the streets shouting who streets our streets\nAfter the drivers zipped down the street to get away from them they chased after him for some reason he stopped going out of his car to inspect the damage he is carbon ends can administer more damage he got back in his car quickly ahead of the mob and left\nThis emerging bran of code street anarchy has lost money asking Portland married Ted Wheeler to regain control of the city which he refuses\nTo do was flipped the script wonder if some city maybe in the south a whole bunch of white supremacist were pulling black people out of their cars and beating the hell out of them are damaging their property taken over the streets yelling who streets our streets what the hell what happened\nOh hell would break loose what had happened in Charlottesville which was a terrible deeds committed upon that woman who was killed the person responsible was subjected to federal hate crime legislation a ... I'm Sorry indictment plus arrest and he should have been killed somebody\nAnd that was roundly condemned this violence is going to lead the shootings oh wait a minute I forgot\nSteve's beliefs of Louisiana was shot and almost killed by a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to kill Republican congressman chased out of restaurants in the elevators on streets in in airports the left as mobs have been ... and all their supporters are doing exactly what Hillary Clinton\nAnd what the Democratic Party wants done are they over playing their hands\nFor weeks from today from tonight for

continue with the U.S marine calls I always\nListen I Love Marines love what they stand for my daddy was a marine John in Washington DC I get Marines presidents here do cutting him in for mark limited John please go ahead\nAnd show following this thing for intently from start to where it is now an\nAbsolutely I agree with your opening first off facts are stubborn things you know and\nYou know John Adams if you're just dissect it and look strictly at ...\nAnd you go off the values of the country that you tell proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling to no kidding of course you know this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was that the president declared a innocent or Brett Kavanaugh isn't that what do you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and\nThis wasn't the case and this wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christine afford down to perform roses path\nWhen she oddly question her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector test and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend has told his credit cards but I redress\nOr what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward of the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for\nBrett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting a tactic actually allow\n[laughter] that's terrified because you're now take somebody a lesser to a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just they're all coming back or something like that\nCould be no coming back whether whether you know\nJust the fear factor and it could be absolute at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell what John Waters Brett Kavanaugh will go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounce that in the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight [laughter] that would that would be and when you\nDo that again I wouldn't get their due process went from such\nYou know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what a or someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a chef\nFor life so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongfully convicted of sexual assault or Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry uh two black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a hub State University case were for\nCollege man at Hofstra were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow student it came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused as someone of a sexual assault\nFor all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look her in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart this story or seen afford improve that she was either a ... or a liar or both\nOh so the coming weeks\nThis Fox News [noise]\nThis is Jackson

W. dot ... dot com bust [noise]\nJob of being on a couple of world we keep you sane\nSeven points yeah well that was\nOne\nThing can I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about the\nNorms of the presidency let's talk about norms of presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was\nThat normal how about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky that he'd violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncreased taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in the war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the president says that normal then you add Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV it's not the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the president's even LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered the Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water grade in line did he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the president's he so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the president say please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to say thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley role\nHe really had to hold the line on some pretty strong personalities your water to produce any direction and encourage it causes much trouble are great courage and\nI just wanted to ask him here and that would otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms ... listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy ice crazy eyes Booker\nDid he violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate ... think a little bit\nI think all violated in orange butter and I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November I don't even remember the eight twenty sixteen that he may not get it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAnd aren't haven't they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse\nBecause they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as the sec\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job is attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but\nWhat happened is that that uh when Trump has criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of Hamilton am known maladies I say let's have more of it if the southern border which is being guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president as corrected\nThe trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese\nAre doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nUp all this as abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also to test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good any thicker every bit as good and that they know nothing good that Donald Trump has that Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm\nI'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries to try hard hard working there for a million that doesn't have to do it well I have respect for him and they will not acknowledge\nAnything at that too is sick today Sharon we got to run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania is Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote if you do not one Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda\nFor the last half of the president's first term get out and vote but continue with more a seven seven three one two three one one still counting on the great American in for the gray one mark\nTwain\nLine Lisa ... Fox News hurricane Michael ... category three taking by the Gulf Coast of Florida\nWell every name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I I think what happened Jeannie in reality is that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help for your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThat Dr believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist as Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that\nHappened I Believe something fundamentally bad happened ... Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist\nIncentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind she had recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist who rented a room in our house\nThat caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then sell 'em out in her mind to get fame or to get money\nShe decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stanford University and she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took that Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime\nDianne Feinstein office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encouraging require her to come forward and won the Senate said\nWhen the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or so perfect for um her responses drew out\nI'm feeling some sympathy they were absolutely perfect\nUm to make you on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life involving those four boys that tried to write a paper\nAnd that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much you didn't get two master's degrees and the doctor it\nDidn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years at Palo Alto University in Stamford\n... and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals what was she would have done Seventy one books and periodicals there's no evidence that affected her life at all and every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other\nThey've all been proven not to occur and Jeanie you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party do you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think a man should be the leader of the house um I\nBelieve that you you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say yes I can I\nDidn't know that there are all Democrats to please Jeannie ... don't do that because men and women are equal in fact women are ... you know the best people I've known in my life or women whether it's my wife my sister my mom passed away about five years ago\nMy granddaughter those are the best people I Know and I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and be told as a man that I don't care about sexual assault against women when I think about women I think I'm On my wife for forty nine years as an appellate judge and the state of Ohio I think about my sister\nWho's the co chairman of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio I think about my beautiful little granddaughter I Want to protect the women around me and make sure they have all the rights privileges and immunities every citizen\nBut I also want to say that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process\nFerrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI wasn't Mendez due process rights because that guarantees down the road that wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charged or there's a title nine violation\nOr rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister growth that's disgusting and if somebody grow because the woman I Want them to be held to account but every now and then a woman like Christina forward either doesn't know the truth or tell us ally and when that happens I Want the presumption of innocence\nTo make sure it's available for innocent victims who have been charged such as bread cabinet\nBrett Kavanaugh as one of the biggest victims in this whole thing would you agree\nAbsolutely I I mean I agree with you I don't think women should not be protected they needed up on a pedestal\nAbsolutely I I have more respect for women than men because\nI've known to many men in my life and I respect women a lot more than I that that then I Love and the men because I Know women are the best people in God's green earth we got to run Jeannie thanks for

we got up to leave and I kind of walked out with some chit chat with him about the reds are the bangles or something going on and there was a photographer standing there named bill ranking who later who earlier became famous for taking the\nThe Bruno Molly photo shoot of O. J.

I got the picture it immediately hurried off\nAnd um that was it and other people came up their picture taken with him and he was uneasy didn't want it to happen seat Neil Armstrong was an engineer\nHe didn't seem so it was a pilot and the furthest thing from the truth was a hero he taught for seven years at University of Cincinnati and the school of engineering and every student had him said he was a wonderful teacher at great professor very bright\nBut when you see the University of Cincinnati approached him do named the skill of engineering that Neil Armstrong school of engineering but that makes sense\nBut that makes sense that the school of engineering after Cincinnati zone Neil Armstrong answer it but yes but Neal said absolutely not I don't want my name on buildings I don't want that and within a few months he left you see\nAnd what he did at that point was simply serve\nOn boards of directors had a farm in Warren County which is a county north of Cincinnati and you see I see I'm Out now and then it advance but nobody would ever know that that was Neil Armstrong that was the man who walked on the moon because he never carried himself away in any way that Neal was any special than anyone else\nSo in the movie comes out on friday you're going to see the actual real depiction of Neil Armstrong and how difficult it was to go to the moon and Nineteen sixty nine when there was less than a fifty fifty chance he would come back alive and in fact NASA drafted a two page statement\nTelling the American people that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin did not make it\nAnd that there forever lost in space because that was the probability of what was going to happen the odds are going there and coming back and being successful and living was less than fifty fifty but Neal\nTook that risk in fact Lebanon other men took it over the next\nThree years and we're not going back to the moon since [noise]\nListening send your with your calls back to the topic that was a talk show host a frivolous number to call his eight seven seven three one two three eighty one one [noise] but see that movie hit us a fabulous movie movie reminded me of the ten commandments still counting undergrad and marriage [noise]\n...\n[laughter]\nAsk any a Mac member what they like most about belonging to the conservative alternative to A.

I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do it if it came out and tear volunteer all you can if you can't donate then get they're not the worse if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can pull out as you can try to gauge as people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being ... in about it but engage them and try to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know want to be part of the crowd so ...\n... talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose at Texas Senate seat to a clown like bait or is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um you\nKnow they just got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and you know he's a you know some people I guess finding physically attracted to eat different strokes for different folks or whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd you know there there's obviously some liberal natives here in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most of most of Texas has you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal there are no yeah\nYeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so uh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've ... we've got to have him when\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs gonna be hard for the for the governor and when the U.S Senate seat but you know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida\nThen the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can get elected\nIf in Florida and\nNew York they begin to me as one and the taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida would tip this thing permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or clean I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty\nHardcore in for Ted Cruz for president and\nI have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nI look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey whoever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there was an animal magnetism that I see president I think he's in Iowa tonight he hopefully will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town that and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there\nWas like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati in orange county it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy is the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and\nIf you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies it\nLooked like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty four", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "09"}
