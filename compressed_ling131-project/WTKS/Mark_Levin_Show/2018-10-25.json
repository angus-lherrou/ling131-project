constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and a Sotomayor and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand the construed this document the way it was meant to be\nAnd what that means definitely is the federal government is way too large it's do it way too much article one section it gives an old our supposed to have all the other powers blow to the states and the people respectively so when every vote that we cast in every speech can we get the idea that the central live the power of the federal

ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy it's a sign of the times a reflection of the coarsening of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners that go with it\nHas more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as fighting words that has given been given minimal constitutional protection because apparently insults and insights let's see but I Do not mean to suggest that it is inconceivable that any\nBut the most palpable incitement could ever be actionable\nPoliticians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically accountable regardless whether the circumstances\nAllow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing ... because of something heard it a political rally no normal

refrigerators same with washers and dryers same with dishwashers\nSame with anything that as steel or for that matter lumina the prices are going up and that has a pressure on what inflation and you can start seeing inflation going up and interest rates going\nI support the American worker I support the American consumer I support the American economy America First means capitalism first\n\nPark
