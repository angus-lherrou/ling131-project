I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her clear lack of understanding of any of it\nWhen I ended up ... and this was the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nAt the polls ever as the polls [laughter] I mean\nOK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's the next her\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in her home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of Swiss surprise endorsement which was mainly on Instagram boats were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media raised only has a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past year or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going\nHey are you so he was up in Tennessee are on the um Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat Bill Bratton sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time at the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's average in a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect where she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race early it is now\nNine points so oh\nNot exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighing in on is negative six percent in a week\nSo I like to say you've got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal you've got a lot of folks that are if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction I enter science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular you\nHave a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment he got celebrities better away and then\nAnd specifically when she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSaid if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrite for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you see here is that the the dirty little details\nTaylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania huh\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nNo hands the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas smelling\nNow she spoke up supporting L G being he writes GB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the way [noise] I guess what\nThe Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton said he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in they'll go\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in in Nashville better\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support\nGay marriage and host of other elegy Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania\n\nSo she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days in a leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\n[laughter] I mean and there's a lot more we we could continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those

for\nA while I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be\nEven a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being anybody of any value or lack of value whatsoever that number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on a night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen\nAnd Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that not really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a it was all in a kind of aggressive\nMusic that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they come from the same cost especially Springsteen where they were anti war uh they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping to God that people are just not taken a serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there's some places where this celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the first thing is you've got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on by\nA celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta and to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen made that comment\nAnd didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and you know when you say that you have tendency now use and you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] game they drew many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just hoping that God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my ...\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony is a certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota Avon\nOh I'm a liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the Panthers sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nWell the people now that are getting jobs at new careers and we gave the numbers out yesterday we have the the highest number of billable jobs ever in history and compared to the unemployment rate we have a million more jobs available than we do have people that are on unemployment it is a fantastic opportunity for people to\nYou know change jobs change careers get more money get better benefits have a greater career trajectory in their life so they can maybe get a little bit better house a nicer car or truck they could take the vacation go out to eat you know every other week whatever they want to do not have to worry about where the money's coming from save for retirement you\nKnow get something really cool for the kids the grandkids that's all it takes money you know I've been without money and then I have money and believe me it's a little easier when you're habit and anybody that tells you any different is full of crap\nAlso nice I get to give some away

B. S. that MPs who somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian bought a Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten\nAnd murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nTo let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no this is the ah\nThe event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a\nBunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months to Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs is on speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas\nSo they may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that bonding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that and we're hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gate and stupidly they decide to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp did lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nU.S Supreme court even what Brecht Kevin all they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be an office another six years\nAnd if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent of those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not is certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it will take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent in the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and\nOnly about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely and should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen is going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments\nFor the last two years of

[noise]\nMy belly accounting and the great American in for the great when Mark Sullivan way of case and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo you know the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we're going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get the Supreme Court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point of Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that state's democratic it's not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but then when I come from one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue on or else we can make the turn\nAnd how back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's live his wife's life Jared Kushner's life everyone's life in the White House will be laid bare and the next two years will not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in Georgia Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect to courses foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international expertise the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history how were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you've got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind\nThat the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you went the next two years not to be about judges not to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy\nThat's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good\nReally good and so think about what's on the ballot and\nTwenty days because the Democrats are incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith in Los Angeles welcome to the mark Levin show hosted by the great American bill Cunningham please go ahead\n[laughter] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S has complicit with the Jamal quiz show um murder I Would say two hundred percent yes and reason why I'm saying that\nBecause I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell I don't know if the deep state but the league that they had conversations with authority ... and his entourage founder range the kitten that this guy\nThough and if you look and recently um John Brennan the last past two days and then and they say he confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think [noise] um yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on the on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe algebra zero out a cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the end of the thing for twenty four seven out of the factual information all doing is recording factual information where both on the cloud though I\nDon't have no heroism against them because they're there when the member grow their there when the fifth member

fabulous children's book it's available now on Amazon thirty percent off name of the book once again as our police by ... marks dad\nAnd a pre order now save up to thirty percent you're talking about police and the way they're treated well\nWhat if CNN and the national media went into the killing of police officers all over the country by individuals that have not been solved of which there are many not solved and what if they spent the time they're spending on cars show geek\nIn a ... finding out who killed police officers when the murders have not been resolved including one in charge down Kentucky with a police officer who was killed about two o'clock in the morning and they're looking for his murder\nHe was pulling off the highway at night two o'clock in the morning a wife and two kids\nAnd some wanted a put a a limb across the exit ramp on the interstate highway so a police officer would stop he stopped got out put his lights on pulled dilemma way and was shot several times in the back and is that\nThere are numerous killings of police officers in America as I speak unresolved and if you think every life is the same which I think in God's eyes it might be Ninety percent\nOf the murders on the Southside of Chicago go unsolved what if CNN instead of caring about the show gave so much\nFound its way to the south side of Chicago to discover why there's about four thousand people shot and seven hundred murdered every year under the leadership of one of the dailies around me manual or Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan\nWhat if they would cover murders in Chicago or the murder of Kate Stanley or the murder of police officers unsolved with the same level of interest that they care about a Saudi citizen murdered seemingly by the Saudi Government and in a a consulate in Turkey\n... what is it about this event which suddenly the entire media is in melt down as it possibly trying to tie Trump to the murder\nIs that what you had a we had a caller earlier today that al Jazeera now there's a reliable news source says the U.S intelligence agencies knew about the killing to take place at a time and didn't stop it\nA nice thing to say I hope we didn't know about it\nI Hope that we knew nothing and that or if he was decapitated her put an acid or tortured for seven minutes that's off what's bad those responsible should be held to account by Saudi Arabians or by Turks how are we involved why is the media trying to pin this on Jared Kushner\nHow come some murders or credit more equal than others cage dialing\nPerson the illegal alien that killed her got off for basically nothing the CNN cover that story to the extent that a murder goes by without punishment\nHow many hundreds of American citizens are murdered every year by illegal aliens can we have some coverage of that or do I get nothing but crickets from the mainstream media just seems to me like some murders are more creative\nEqual than other murders and you didn't know I didn't know ... seemed like a nice guy had a wife with some good kids should not have been murdered along with the half a million Syrians murdered by the Iranians and the Russians

I mean personally I think it's because it's a horrible story and B\nTrump is looming on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw it in but I personally don't think it's going to work um but it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and and time off to says she goes I\nPut this thing what is there about this thing will show gay I guess I wrote some comes the Washington Post he had a green card but it is a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess a Saudi Arabian territory\nAnd yet and yet what uh it's it's what I mean it's interesting when a when re most in lieu were\nMurdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car police officers in New York City\nThat was like a one day story nationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing ...

know markets are\nTending to a family members had some medical difficulties Marco be back with you and I on Monday of next week but until then it's always a kick always a pleasure to have on the president of United States Donald J drop I've interviewed many times over the years normally one of his selling a book or doing a business deal\nAnd we've established a bit of a friendship I'm happy to defend that great man and ABC News George Stephanopoulos or on CNN I have a lot of feelings for the president or forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into the money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it after I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to ... cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nUh we have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea are so\nMany jobs you're talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico we're talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs for attention don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been\nBrutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years I mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're called me back but\nHim
