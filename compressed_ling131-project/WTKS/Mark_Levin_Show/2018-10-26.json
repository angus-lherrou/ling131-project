mothers office beat her car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses and the mother investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nDC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone fall emotion the squash or otherwise resist the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crunch or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nChunk clear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to here in December involves\nAn assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell\nYou it's not hard to tell at all Mr Miller ... challenged we\nKnow from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making and professor calibrate she has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\n\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of his authority illegal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of my list criminal cases but\nAll the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom of ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the

course the left would love nothing more than to control the governorship and the control what takes place in that state prior to the twenty twenty election as they would Texas and uh it's very important this rates the taking place in Florida and the Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country's pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects [noise] run to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists\nDid is they arrange a number of excursion one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at a he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city\nOf but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket\nTo go see the white Hamilton I mean people hear about these Campbell to pick up they're going to go to the movie the tickets were at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that Andrews lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that\nBut then those same lobbyists also arranged a luxury\nFor night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up talking about a thousand dollars a free Andrew and his wife a an addition some other folks and getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark lo and behold mayor Andrew Gillum turns around\nAnd he gives those lobbyist two million dollar deal that they were looking for it so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for it so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I brought it up about that\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted is denial showed he was wine um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line or the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart in the law you understand the stuff\nWith an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official about the only reason you would do such an act\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people and him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation and the guy got my kids\nBut um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem and his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he under that subject so that to me is is a is an interesting mission or because the bottom line is why would they be investigating corruption in city\nThe whole if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nI don't think that's going to be allowed to happen here I'm sure there are contingency plans being made right now and I would imagine barriers are part of that plan and I would imagine as many troops unnecessary to stop the invasion of the United states by people that are not willing to follow the laws that we have set out on immigration\nThe really sad thing is that we have other silence on the left\nAnd and even they almost outward support for people that want to violate our laws I guess that's what we've been watching unfolding with sanctuary cities and states and\nYou know here we have even criminal aliens I mean in the case some of your son ran a how long was the murder of your son in jail before he was let out and not handed over to ice\nWas shot it actually the the Vatican better grant never served it day in jail or prison for his his prior conviction\n... never served a day and and you see this all the time with a lot of these illegal immigrants they played it down or they use their ... status or you know their children they use their children I mean I've got an anchor babies I don't have anybody to take care of them you know they use this all the time and\nWell you know if you really want to talk about child separation edits and its finality um and the president was the one that fixed it even though it existed in the Obama and Bush years you're experiencing child separation forever there's no hope your son was murdered we we can't bring him back from the dead\nNo shot him and it's like people I spend Christmas we put up a Christmas tree on graves grave I spent just birthdays and most of the other holidays we spend with him at his great I mean we we don't\nThat's the only way we have to be with him obviously you know anybody who believes in God and believes in the habit that he is with us all the ... ... you need a place to go visit him and and that's likely place\nAnd see you have all these angel families that that is what they do this is what they have we're never going to see that I get\nThe illegals that are bringing their children are using other children and screaming about separation they're going to get to see their children to get there going to be reunited five watts within seven to twelve day that's by law\nI ... I just want to thank you for what you're doing your you know I listened to your when your strength and\nAnd obviously you're trying to prevent this from happening all we're really asking for nobody is against immigration we just wanted to be legal we want to be able to vet the people that come into this country they've got to be able to take care of themselves and we want to know that they have the best interests of this country and love of this country that\nWe have and they're not going to be a burden or a threat to any of our our citizens that are here\nAnd we don't have control of it now but anyway I'm Steve thank you for being with us our thoughts and prayers always with you sir you're great American and uh I I really pray for you and your family as I Know how hard this is every night\nSean thank you and thank you for having me and it's good to talk to you\nThanks to my friend eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number a lot more of this tonight on Hannity nine eastern on the Fox news channel [noise]\n\nOr download Sean Hannity and the breaking news you might have missed it a\nShot cider information\nOn Hannity [noise]\nRadio that examines going well not coming [noise]\nHey what was the last time you and your family ever gather around the table to play the game maybe it sounds old fashioned but you've got to listen to me the new board games are amazing and there's one you've got to try it's the wits and wages party game it's so simple to learn you can play with anybody any age the entire family\nAnd there'll be no other game out there that brings your family together like which and waitress\nGo to your local target I highly recommend you get it with an wages wits and wages available at target\nThink about the timing may your phone tracking pollen off track employing more boys one day and then we should be more healthier\nAnd more productive politics with my family income and we began\nOn there and not much media I guess Tom flash media\nSt Louis or an international diamonds interests common every second divorce we gave thirty million dollar extra savings door why like thirty month zero interest finance Hillary second floor had international that isn't going to prevent\nIt hey it's ... you know when I was in my twenties the thought of being in my seventies was abhorrent but thanks as many management doctor Harry Collins I hardly feel different\nIf a twenty year old man has the hormone levels above sixty year old man he's going to feel terrible in his primary care doctor will treat him but if a sixty year old man has the hormone levels of sixty year old man his doctor will tell him he's normal and just grow old grace Milly\nShe'll be optimal not normal for your age pulse of an age management of nine to five six nine one one or go to age management med dot com station\nOutside the home for Sean Hannity in Savannah news radio Ninety seven ... seven W T chaos\n[noise]\nIt was an ... shop on me and they're great products you cannot get them in any store but they're made with natural or peptides and plants themselves and they work and it's better than anything you'll find in any store ever\nGenuine which gets rid of bags and puffy in his Sunday arise oh if you purchase junior so this is the last week you'll get the brand new Gen yourself sunspot correct or for free now that takes care of sunspots aged pots and even read inflamed patches that you might have\nNo time is running out of this incredible special you by John you sell to get rid of bags and ... and also you\nGet the sunspot correct or from junior so absolutely free at least products and guaranteed to work in a short time or you get your money back as ... as little as twelve hours it's going to start working a guaranteed or you get your money back go to Jen your cell dot com or just call now eight hundred skin by zero nine and if you do it right now\nYou'll get ... luxury Mike Rowe Durham abrasion\nYou'll get that free and that will rejuvenate and on clog pours for instant radiant baby soft skin by the way shipping is free right the last day of this order go to Jen you sell dot com right now call eight hundred skin by zero nine January ... dot com eight hundred getting five zero nine from our friends at\n... right that is going to wrap things up for tonight uh Hannity tonight we have captured guy that's been sending these mail bombs or the latest developments on that case also the politicizing of this issue by the left of the left has ignored the most incendiary rhetoric leading up to this\nAh we'll have Sebastian Gorka Bernie carrot tonight joke conscious Tammy Bruce that's all coming up that's nine eastern tonight on Hannity have a great weekend we'll see you tonight at nine nine will be back here on Monday would just eight days to go\n[noise]\n\nIf you suffer from E.

prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau chip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past I we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\nPresident United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got seven the fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do\nWhen I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them tour northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants them\nThese people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume or ...\nEven though they're carrying their flags\nAnd in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving their hell host Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea Mr produce\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit\nTo they could probably use so that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country supported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within\nThe United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth but here we can accommodate everybody OK\nWell use Hoover too I don't care if we can use ... and use taxis greyhound whatever\nI'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhile Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you

there like so it's all about this right you know that that was said James Carville is looking over that look in the ass\nThat's exactly what's happening except Mel it's Republicans doing it this\nGuy this guy really is a mental image it\nLook at the brown people\nThe brown people\nWe want to enforce our laws and you see it's about the brown people\n\nJoe Scarborough the White House man on TV next to Chris Matthews\nIt's about the brown people really went Shelby Steele was one of my uh Fox show several months ago life liberty and live and he pointed out the guy's a talk this way they feel like they immunize themselves from criticism that they're better than all of you and so they can\nPosition themselves you see is\nSupporting brown people but you folks out there who are brown you obviously have brown people because you don't agree with Joe\nThis is a sick mindset and they want to talk about\nPut fuel on the far when they constantly push this racist narrative\nConstantly\nAnd then secondarily Republicans have guarded people's health care Obamacare's in place other than the individual mandate nobody's got it any this Medicare's in place Medicaid's been expanded Obamacare's in place\n\nOne of the biggest animals and human history is Adolf Hitler they call they call American citizens who voted for him Nazis races\nBut it's Trump you see\nIf the left and the Democrats and the media had accepted the results of this last election in twenty sixteen\nCriticized the president of course but try to destroy him come up with Russian conspiracy theories act like they're the national Enquirer with every allegation\nTry and force him from office talking about his mental illness and on and on and on\nIf they accepted his legitimacy as president and criticized his policies or what he would say that's one thing but that's not what's going on in this country\nThat's not what's going on in this country\nWe all know it don't call your little whiny\nAsked to me and asked my Trump said
