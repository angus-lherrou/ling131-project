Rick has a chance say the Republican pickup Bill Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen points and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate he he's even in the ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud in for Marco then by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but but nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head\nIn one of the things that I ended up noticing\nWhen we were taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nWell it is you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the top sustained when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the went just as you saw with Florence and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey in Houston\nLast year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the FBI tornado scale right\nWith top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I think I got my parents and my sister my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast um southeastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were out power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma struck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach you sold all reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are that close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that is kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere between you could be on the Gulf I'd take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures to Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to break you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before the standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Savannah", "day": "13"}
