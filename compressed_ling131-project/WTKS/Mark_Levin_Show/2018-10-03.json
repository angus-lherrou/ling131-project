have so many upset including some ...\nSome hosts\nWhat exactly did he say did he say something worse than the Democrats are upset about cabinet did he say something in a way that was more outrageous than Saturday Night live when it dealt with Kevin\nDid he make a fabricated accusation like the multiple fabricated accusations that have been made about Kavanaugh\n\nWell I listen to what the

comments outrageous are disgusting or mean shouldn't they been looking in the mere\nShouldn't they be looking in the mirror and the media especially the media especially\nThis is from uh the daily mail exclusive Christine forward through her under the bus strained sex assault witness Leyland Kaiser her lifelong girlfriend seeing for the first time as close family member confirmed she did not corroborate school friend Ford story to the FBI\nAnd where are we looking Leland Kaiser was seen for the first time\nKaiser fifty to form described as your best friend had holding my arms preparatory school and besides the Marilyn was her final hope for cooperation however the former pro golfer couldn't corroborate Ford story when she was interviewed by the FBI on Saturday I Believe this is Bob ... ex wife by the way\nBack to the daily mail TV exclusive focus for the first time since news of Ford named her Kaiser showed the stress of being put into the national spotlight\nThe closest relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion the Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges and why aren't the media all worked up about how Dr\nFord through a fellow female Leland Kaiser under the bus\nShe can't remember it because of significant health challenges their health challenges have not impaired her memory\nBut being caught up in the Kavanaugh scandal has proof physically trying to her the relatives said Lee ... is not a well woman she has had years of injuries that have been that have seen her have fourteen operations she just wants to get better well that's a very compassionate Christine for it I Would say wouldn't you America\nI just thought I'd bring this up because which women\nAre we supposed to be protecting\nIn defending in which women are we not supposed to be protecting in defending\nNow that renovation at her home\nWith the two doors the two front or I just thought it was on the whole thing came up well it's kinda odd people have looked into this real clear investigations looked into this\nYou know what they found that second door wasn't there for an exit that second or lead to a refurbished room in a bathroom where businesses were run out of it\nOr the room could have been rent it so that room was created with that door not\nOf any a psychological issues or difficulties Paul Sparrow points that are real clear investigations\nNo it was created as another form of a of income\nYou start adding things that these things up it really does create a problem doesn't in Mr producer\nI mean you go through this one thing after another after another and of course now they're indignant at the up yeah I did interview Kavanaugh why she's going to change your opinion\nThat argument doesn't even make sense why is she going to change your opinion of the FBI that can be perjury I don't think she'll do that and I didn't even interview judge Kavanaugh well why should they is he going to change his opinion I don't think so\nAll we need to get to the truth no all they do is interview people and ask them questions to write it up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did an interview\nDr\nFord then they should take with them\nRachel Mitt trolls memo and as well as several of the points I've been raising\nAnd then have Dr Ford square the circle that would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they could do the same with Kavanaugh but I don't see any contradictions in his testimony to you\nI really don't I don't think you have a lot of ex\nKavanaugh girlfriends coming forward and saying\nOh you lied about this and he lied about that and now that's not true\nHe did like the fly and er he wasn't claustrophobic and er he did this and he did that there's nobody who said that well yeah I have this old guy want the year ... through ...\nThrough ice [noise] luckily didn't throw a lab or an ashtray allow Hillary Clinton\n\nWhatever your feelings about it there's no escaping that fact\nAnd to have a party or in one point of our history where its primary objective was to protect slavery another time in its history its primary objective was to protect segregation\nA war fought over slavery riots in wars if he will domestically fought over segregation\n\nThen they claim the mantle of civil rights when it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery that oppose segregation those were not a Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least the old Democrats are gone they didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset of nullification you can see it was ... cities secession you can see it in California with the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democrat Party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democrat Party cannot survive if the nation is United what is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity a political entity\nThat is made up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion based on income based on age\n\nAnd so forth and so it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always had to get power and how to keep it had to advance the cause whether they win elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the progressive tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have temporary control everything in the mentality of government but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard dies the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government and this massive administrator state so even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win and when they win elections they tell you they have a mandate\nSo they never lose\nWhat an Obama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats who did vote\n\nLook yesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands\nWhat did they get that information where did they get that information\nIs is a civil liberties union we're forced to file federal income taxes we're forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS in state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages\n\nThey went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages\nThat boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard copy as opposed to\nA electronically and provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office he attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great wealth you've never seen the peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\n\nOr any of these multi billionaire families with a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of you are familiar with New York city aren't you\nAll those buildings with the president's name on he created those\n\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nIt's a news like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimal got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks they'd need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now phew oh back taxes to the IRS call my friends at optimal tax relief\nEight hundred for nine
