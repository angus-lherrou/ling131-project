talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship some of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or would have been done already and he said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why parents a statute if in fact as the left says and some of these conservatives say 'cause there are no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna fix statute won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned ways but a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\n\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship was not actually implemented in this country until the sixties and seventies that Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy by the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and those statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabin all was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happen to be wrong\nHe knows more than they do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial sir premises him that creates a one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWith a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents\nThat plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq what collectively ignoring endless uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOffer the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nThe fourteenth amendment representative James F Wilson Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ugly that it was quote\nEstablishments no new right declaring no new principal on quote quote it is not the object of this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those which belonged to every citizen unquote that's what he declared in Nineteen sixty six I Want you to think about it\nHow many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it wouldn't be applied\nTo illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not one\n\nWas passed to protect African American\nTheir bureaucracy of the great deal decided chicken first citizenship\nOn babies born of illegal aliens in this country and now we're told in order to reverse that the price in the United\nStates has to push for a constitutional amendment or Congress has to pass a statute but he's

[noise]\nPatrick ... is the attorney general of West Virginia he is a conservative views the constitution list he doesn't have to wait for the Democrats to vote to figure out the way he should vote he will not vote for Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader in the United States Senate how are you Patrick Marcy\nI'm doing great mark Levin thanks for having me on your show I'm a big fan and I'm really excited to be on line and talking about the big issues and the U.S Senate race is going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow the U.S Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidates\nEh let's start at the base is I'm a conservative fighter\nMark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plants that was just this amazing power grab over the United states energy supply\nWe lead the way built for twenty seven state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision of Justice Scalia's light that was the big deal we've let on many other big issue is taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless\nI'm strongly pro life endorsed by all the pro life groups because not only check the box on the issue of like I Believe in the fact of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which of of all in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment and our gun rights\nAnd we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president because he is helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington CD drive the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of life\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally had signs saying that he supports Planned Parenthood and also that he stood with life on the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you need someone who is pro life who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion\nWho wants to stop the government funding a Planned Parenthood on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers match and\nHis best known for offering a big gun control bill and on the issue of coal\nOh I have to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal Joe mattress and conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you just because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and weights and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYear right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need help and\nYour great live and all that perfect climate and really accurate about match mhm\nNow what are your priorities among uh you you mentioned a number of them\nI suppose he supported the president's tax cuts you reject this caravan you want a wall on the southern border\nMan well absolutely so let's START I agree with all the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia\nNot only doubling the standard deduction which helps a lot of hardworking families and our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes your they're really hoping lift our economy up to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the Trump tax cuts marked with the deregulatory approach\nI mean let's face it under the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and\nCertainly they went after fossil fuels\nI stood up and I said no to that not SATs when I followed those lawsuits and President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things\nFor our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes\nAnd then ultimately deregulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nWell take my advice you one happier more productive employees than consider getting X. chair for your entire staff you know what it is it's a very reasonable investment that will pay huge dividends because you want your employees to be comfortable\nAnd happy and what they're doing\nSo or ex chair is on sale now for a hundred dollars off of yack now you go to ... dot com that secretary L.
