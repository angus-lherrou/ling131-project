cuts that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they hadn't been a hard and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\n\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner what Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lives completely\nIt is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media he does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question it to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of him by\nBy a pre existing narrative and trying to advance he re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis to say hey this is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical\nTrump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames\nLesley Stahl who's smart she's listens she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rough some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period end the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about it or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just any turn around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last words he gets the last word he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this or when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie ... and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they\nDon't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hit the hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity so he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in any did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of frauds\nIn and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who\nWhat other presidents other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty and twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that Trump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lives by driving them to win Saturday\n\nIs entirely inauthentic Elizabeth Warren will not\nYou have an eight and nine o'clock pours for instantly radiant made me soft skin order now and shipping is also free called eight hundred skin sick so for or go to genocide dot com ledge genocide that top\n... live in a news radio Ninety seven point seven to twelve Ninety W.

sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall I Know it because I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who because honest to God

paying their fair share of really\nBecause I saw a fascinating piece today I got a lot to cover today but I saw a fascinating piece in Bloomberg of all plan not a big\nHuge fan of the Web but once in a while they have good articles on economic and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIf I say let me just say something numbers so much it's the comparison\nYou'll see what I mean I'm In the top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners\nPaying astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country I think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country\nChew on that one for a minute\nYou may say okay well you know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\n\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent view liberals who have a tough time with\nThis kind of stuff [noise]\nPays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nTo pick up about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... probably not that rich you know pay your fair share of the you know the lip vets are thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not the Trump just doesn't except that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts over with a\nYou know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job\nThe top one percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load\nThan the bottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share of that is not is you hear what I'm ... there's more by this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg\nPeace again not some right wing website here I mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberal listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted Web site there that was just trying to manipulate the facts just from boomer okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share stuff as John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we had Al Sharpton and his tax debacle we\nHave a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example lead by example if you believe in what you're saying see there's no hypocrisy here for Republicans we think taxes sock because we think outside of our military\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face with a straight face how they're not paying their fair share\nFourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax law as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you read it for the rich no no no no no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair\nShare is fair shall we used to make up his doping stupid talking point it rich don't pay their fair share they don't pay pay as much as the

what\nThe left having run myself a ball unsuccessfully almost doesn't count politics is you know but you know listen I gave it the old college try out a lot of experience um in liberal states Marilyn specifically where I did run and one of the things I've always not liked what respected about the Democrat\nIs their ability to almost ruthlessly stay on message follow me here\nWhether it was Obamacare the Obama tax hikes Obama regulatory assault in red tape on our businesses they are on message no matter what\nObama cares about we got to get more coverage the tax cuts we got to make people pay their fair share about regulations we got to protect the environment and\nFilling up what they are almost ruthlessly good at staying on message Donald Trump has been so fragile so frazzled that just and it's why am I Try to be a target is why no you're wrong\nThat just weeks before a midterm election a major party representative for their party Elizabeth Warren releases and ancestry or whatever a DNA thing showing she's one one thousand uh twenty fours Native American\nAnd even Jim Messina who was an Obama big shot advisor tweeted out today what the heck are you doing three weeks before mid term\nSo I I ... with all due respect job I I get what you're saying\nI could not disagree with you more I think it was a genius political move and I'm not Muslim I'm not a golden calf worship or of any politician I think it was a genius move to entirely get the Democrat Party to not talk about anything of substance and to focus on what Trump wants to focus on their fraudulent\nNature rather than what they want so I got to take a break on of sorry thanks for the call I see your point but I totally totally disagree there is no one with Trump's got a PHD in owning

were isolated from the truth over you need is one\nOf the ABC nightly news NBC nightly news CNN story on how the Clintons surpluses met they would go away forever but they won't do it\nThey do this now they're doing it now\nAnd the reason I bring it up is because they are good at staying on message that's how they get these myths to persist over time Trump pass them scattered all over the place they cannot stay on message you got one guy who Spartacus you got one guy I skateboard in the parking lot better now you got one guy talking about\nFart jokes at a at a serious Sheldon Whitehouse this is the Democrats\nI fundamentally\nDisagree with just about all of their policy positions but I'm telling you I've always respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it\nThey are so overtaken with rage at\nEverything this guy represents the anti swamp rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruth in straight up life they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\nHe's got them talking about booth failing in Senate hearings he's got\nA Cory Booker declaring he's

the Cherokee Nation just responded and and in a brutal\nBrutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\n\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media and turns it back on them\nHe ends he gets the last word in just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers\nAny talks like normal Americans this is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and their swap rat Democrats back on their heels 'cause they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they are falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I've said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is Don apologizing for taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happened to be successful\nAnd wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not give it attached to the rich why why are we not doing that why well because it'll look that well is it good for the economy\nYeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was\nMake the case truck dodging I told\nYou the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat the fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\n... do you understand the gravity of what I just do the fourth team hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country\nGet liberal delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves\nBernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren John Kerry John

of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn or you might as well bird you're flushing it down the toilet Milton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while you know\nIt's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great Milton Friedman he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can
