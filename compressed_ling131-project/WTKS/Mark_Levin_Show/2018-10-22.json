I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted they maybe they sort of ten years when it comes time to come out there's a painter requests from ice you either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that the only two options\nAndrew will not answer the question that I mean let me would be willing to release centered around the world and sort of well of course I I just think that the show boating has MS is not there there's no show\nBoating pal\nI found a lot of that during the course of the debate these cheap shots these are these dismissive comments showboat there's no show boating go ahead\nWhat ... what would we will do is we will follow the law if you commit a crime you do the time if through the Utica tore process in a judge issued a warrant\nFor arrest or movement and to an ice facility that way we're actually what we will stop\nThat's not the way it works a judge does not issue in order putting somebody in the ice facility the individual has done time they've been charged they'd been prosecuted they've been found guilty their sentence they served their sentence now you have to open the jailhouse store\nIs that person going to wind up in a yellow bus a yellow eyes spots that winds up deporting that person or is that person going to walk out that Joe how store and go into your neighborhood that's the question\nAnd obviously Gillum takes the ladder position this was a big deal it's a big point he's so radical he doesn't want you to understand the process but that's the process you turn them over to the feds to deport them ... states can't deport\nPeople or they're losing your community\nSo Fifteen dollar minimum wage which will bankrupt many small businesses are chase them off and by the way is harmful to many many people who work for instance in the hotel industry the restaurant industry and so forth\nAnd the elimination of Medicare under the guise of health care for all and a massive expansion of Medicaid which is health care for poor people\nYou know the other thing is when you're a state that has all these illegal aliens coming in and Florida is one of them in Texas is one of them and so forth and you're saying you know what we're going to pay for all the health care and medical care related to this and and so forth and so on you're going to be attracting more and more people who need more and more state benefits\n\nSo you're expanding the welfare state while you're expanding the number of people who are on the welfare state\n\nThese are just a few issues that will odd really destroy a state like Florida or a state like Texas destroyed as they have these other states\n\nIt's a big deal\nAnd then you wouldn't really understand it because tapper never really follow that he didn't drill down\n\nHe had his own agenda and of course he brings up the agenda the Democrat Party in Florida I'm just using this as an example immediately tried to paint the scientist says a racist\nWhich is so sickening and outrageous\nBut that's what they do on the left and the left being the media and the Democrat Party\nThat's what they do\nMeanwhile once again you have an African\nAmerican running for the Senate in Michigan\n\nAnd he's conservative and he's a capitalist and he believes in the constitution and the rule of law he doesn't get the kind of attention that Gillum gets\nWhy not well you know why\n\nIt's the the media mentality we\nTalked about the show ... matter briefly I'm trying to figure out how this story winds up being about Donald Trump\n\nHow does this story wind up being about Donald Trump\n\nAnd where does the media get off claiming the moral high ground\nWhen human rights abuses all over the world\nRight off our border take place everyday involving far more than one individual mostly go under reported or not report\nHow many stories did they do about torture and political prisoners in Cuba when Obama was opening an embassy in Cuba\n\nNow they're legitimate policy questions can we debate those\nIs the president right when he says I'm not going to forfeit a hundred and ten billion dollar purchase of American military armaments which the Chinese or the Russians would sell otherwise why is that a controversial statement\n\nThe purpose of that sale is the benefit us if it purely benefited the Saudis that would be one thing but it benefits America\n\nI mean as I said earlier in the front of what the hell we open an embassy in Cuba it's a police state that tortures murders\n\nPresident's been attacked\nBecause of his heart policies on China\n\nI told your Iran has one of the highest execution rates in the world China has the highest execution right in the world as the Tibetans\n\nAsked the other religious minorities in China ask any of the political dissidents how they're treated in China\n\nAnd these aren't real trials that take place in China at all All right so what should we do\nWhat should we do\nThese are legitimate questions that ought to be engaged discuss\nPolicy thoughtfully considered\nBut who is neat jerking around now the media and all that the president monster that President muster that presidents had Thirteen different positions on this\nIt's a non American\nCitizen in the Saudi consulate Saudi territory within the country of turkey\nWithin the country of turkey\nI
