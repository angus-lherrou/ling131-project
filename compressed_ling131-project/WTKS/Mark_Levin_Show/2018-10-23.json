a ... surge he can use some cash so we can get some ads up there in the last few weeks chip Roy dot com also folks and the twenty first district isn't that a trip\nThat is the twenty first congressional district in the center of taxes in a pre shape\nA you saying that it on my website we were spending every dollar the Democrats are under full assault here I got to tell you I was out there early voting hours at a rally with Governor Abbott twice one in Austin one advantage I mean you know he's obviously now gone down in Houston with the president and with Senator Cruz\nIt's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up but I tell you early voting numbers are really high really really high they've smashed all record on I think in areas that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turn out we ...\n[noise] yeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now really don't put this off get out there and voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left\nTo try in a in a change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early and the more uh people who do that the better now tell us a\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raised a and it is a a you know height and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good tax and we feel good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up\nIn order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal who served in the United States Army and I thank him\nFor a service but he uses that to try to claim centrism at the claim independent that he's running into that but there is nothing set for nothing independent about somebody who is already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump who's already said that he would undo the tax cuts\nIt was already said that he would put in place that carbon tax there's already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run the factors that he's not but I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they're seeing through Mr O'Rourke\nA efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\nAnd a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much are worth seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others\nAre the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists who could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because\nThey know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why we're better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator\nTo do all of the socialist things where at least it's constitutionally\nReasonable to have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the only way to go came up when they had people over the Chuck Schumer and the rest of the left is on the coast or trying to buy off Texas with thirty eight million dollars of money\nDrug warehouses tunnels I've seen it all look I understand the people come from countries where there's great poverty and little opportunity um but the answer isn't not obeying the laws that we have a an immigration policy immigration laws the first step if you want to ever come to America\nIs to respect the laws of this land\nRespect America sovereignty and respect our borders and that if you're not willing to do that basic most fundamental of things and then at that point there are other people that would would be willing to accept that and doing the right way and they should have precedence over those that are lawless and don't respect our laws\nSo it's really really simple\nAnd you know I feel listen to the world America had the money you know we do so much already ... tunes are billions and trillions of dollars were spent over the years to help other people in other lands\nAt some point we've got to take care of America First we've got to take Americans out of poverty first we've got Americans that need help in this country that that don't yet have not fully gotten on board we need every American successful and those that can't take care of themselves they will be taking care of you\nKnow America's never lack for compassion just the opposite there's never been a country that has accumulated more power and used it for the advancement of human good around the world more than the U.S including paying the price and shutting the blood for the cause of liberty and freedom for many people around the world\nUm but it is that we cannot take on the world's problems either we don't have the money we don't have the ability to do that\nAnyway eight hundred nine four one showing you want to be a part of the program dawn as in Iowa Don Hi how

boxes Jessica Rosenthal has more live\nSenior White House correspondent on good morning America today Sicilia Vega ... news busters cut to go\nWell let me just give me some perspective here this so called national emergency actually really represents about point zero six percent of all the undocumented people already in this country so we're talking about a very small fraction of people here but the president is hoping that this is a winning strategy of the same trials you've got this\nWas a news report this is the White House correspondent the senior White House correspondent for ABC News good morning America\nGo ahead\nAnd the White House for help Republicans an edge in terms of that strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid\nThat the president\nIs able to cause you to be\nFearful and scared you're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place\nAnd besides it's only zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country the irony is that there's so many illegal aliens in this country seven thousand or whatever the numbers marching to our southern border to this reporter simply no big deal\nPeter Alexander another White House\nCorrespondent this time on the today show that would be NBC had tip news busters cut three go\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here as the economy is strong unemployment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message of free\nAnd I'll just fear stop this was another journalist\nSo instead of talking about the economy which of course the media never talk about\nInstead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and order remind you of course it is law and order but\nIt's fear UC go ahead\nArgument focuses on stoking fears of illegal

... in a lot of states in metropolitan areas it's no joke\n\nIt's him is Thirteen that stokes fear not the president of the United states\nGo ahead\nIt's what he's been trying to do recently to try to motivate his base of support his voters now some\nSay it's all about motivating you because you see ladies and gentlemen unless you are absolutely emotionally out of your mind you're not going to vote\nYou're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is not an important issue it may not be an important issue\nTo phony journalists to phony anchors to phony host a phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\nIt is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters but people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it matters to people who work with their hands many people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\nGo ahead Democrats from winning back the house or the Senate or both obviously what's crucial in this circumstance here is that the president recognizes that he is up
