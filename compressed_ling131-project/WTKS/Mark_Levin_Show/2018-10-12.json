Republican type says well remember when you had the Republican establishment types that said oh you\nCan't compete for black people or well if you don't compete for black people maybe that's a self fulfilling prophecy which again you might think George W. Bush was racist no [laughter] I said go\nDuring the country in the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the total series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time he's looking he'll look it gone you know look at the teleprompter\nGet gone yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran he said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts\n[laughter] but yeah no\nIt isn't as\nBad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up starts reading the teleprompter\nAnd all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThat you can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a raises Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nThat has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you had to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\n[laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going be [noise] I I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh ended up getting a call and call came from government office during a unemployment verification jak verified the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place\nAnd I can tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nIt was like OK gets off the bone and she tells me\nYou know what to do just happen Senate making too much money\nSingle mother she's a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that are again James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now while I of course open change when I was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about why people right I mean come on look at them\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you say\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue God da was not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media

Obama's among likely voters his approval rating happened to me right now three points higher than Brock Obama's three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with dandy two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll the lives that were thrown out there where perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that well you know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo\nPeople understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage law folks get upset about the way things are portrayed\nBut remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence do we think they have\nIf they have the type of impact in elections\nAnd that many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nYou know middle they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better these are all things that are back so that's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIs why we might actually be one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not losing\nIn this presidential election cycle [noise]\nThese are all the things that are on the table something else [noise] but you can't a lot of people about [noise]\nYou can't lie to people about financial fraud and we're going to talk about that and Medicare for all coming up next because Medicare for all is the biggest financial fraud ever for such a way I'm Brian mud and for the gray one more glib\nWay what I say my first one is on Second Life goes on\nIn Nineteen thirty eight Abbott and Costello first began to wonder who's on first and ... had already been controlling pests for ten years it's been eight years in Abbott and Costello still don't know who's on first but whose first in pest control is a fact\nWithin Ninety years history show turned mine that's controlled strike out bugs ... asteroid six five one nine thousand [noise]\nLisa ... Fox News pastor Andrew runs in the American\nMedicare for all its financial broad what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted\nHere is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago\nMedicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points real quickly\nAnd here's the first one\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick\nFifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nIt is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have ... it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott\nWho was term limited and running for the Senate Andrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians no no\nYou won't have the most ... liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and you go well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of the five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode the wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with us money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so as you hear Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who was a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate is why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nMedicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's got to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal federal has a basic financial literacy test and right now\nYou about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what the average Jeanette take home pay now up six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so the living wage\nFunny what happens we actually have a good economy you out a living wage and the minimum wage and I was just a bunch of BS killing Medicare for all [noise]

the grand scheme of the media kind of losing his mind everybody had to point out what a ... and you have I vote password use which job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragging the energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to kind of channel all of that and and you got to you know every now and then you're going to have a hydrogen I I play and the the president or the president [laughter]\nAs you one of my\nOne of my all time favorite reactions Michael\nMeyers watching ... da du the Katrina relief like where is the exit button on this stage right now\nHow can I get off of here now please and ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is like okay [laughter] what do I do hear you talk about role reversal because he's usually the people may person making people have dumped trouble but you gotta gotta feeling that\nFor once he got a dose of his own are kind of thing there anyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and this is the way the shutdown dropped the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pace it insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks at work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country\nAnd it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult beans financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else\nThat is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person net take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody why I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about\nThirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they filed their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody's uh I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now\nThe next part that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because evil\nCorporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all the stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud is well it's dishonest to its ally the ah seem to be saying you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not the person will the corporate tax cuts\nThe share buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rates rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the ... the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation shape the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance
